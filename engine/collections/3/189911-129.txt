In October 1831 , Muhammad Ali of Egypt dispatched his modernized army commanded by his son Ibrahim Pasha in a campaign to annex Ottoman Syria , including Palestine . Ibrahim Pasha 's forces had previously defeated the Ottomans and gained control of Sudan and the western Arabian Peninsula . Their entry into Palestine was not resisted by the local inhabitants , nor by the rural sheikhs of the central highlands . However , Abdullah Pasha resisted the conquest from Acre , which was besieged and ultimately surrendered in May 1832 .
