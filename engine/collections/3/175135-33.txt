Along with revamping the entire Killstreak reward system , Modern Warfare 3 also has a completely modified Ranking and Unlocks system , which does not use a currency system for unlocks . The player 's primary weapon levels up alongside the player , and unlocks a number of `` Proficiency '' perks such as Attachments , ( allows two attachments and is a successor to the `` Bling '' and `` Warlord '' perks ) , Kick ( reduced recoil while aiming down the player 's sight ) and Focus ( reduced flinching while under fire ) . Only one Proficiency can be put on a primary weapon . Another new addition is the ability to equip `` Hybrid Scopes '' on a weapon , such as a Reflex Sight a magnifier similar to an ACOG on the same weapon , and the player can switch between the scopes . Modern Warfare 3 introduces a new `` Prestige Shop '' which will unlock only after the player has selected the option to prestige for the first time . The `` Prestige Shop '' allows Prestige players to use tokens they gain from using the Prestige option to buy exclusive features such as double XP and an extra custom weapon class .
