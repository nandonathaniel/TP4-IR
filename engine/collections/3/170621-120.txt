Following the accession of the UK to European Economic Community ( now the European Union ) in 1972 , the UK became bound by European law and more importantly , the principle of the supremacy of European Union law . According to this principle , which was outlined by the European Court of Justice in 1964 in the case of Costa v. ENEL , laws of member states that conflict with EU laws must be disapplied by member states ' courts . The conflict between the principles of the primacy of EU law and of parliamentary supremacy was illustrated in the judgment in Thoburn v Sunderland City Council , which held that the European Communities Act 1972 , the Act that initiated British involvement in the EU , could not be implicitly repealed simply by the passing of subsequent legislation inconsistent with European law . The court went further and suggested that the 1972 Act formed part of a category of special `` constitutional statutes '' that were not subject to implied repeal . This exception to the doctrine of implied repeal was something of a novelty , though the court stated that it remained open for Parliament to expressly repeal the Act . Following the UK 's referendum on EU membership in June 2016 , it is politically conceivable that Parliament would now do so , but constitutional lawyers have also questioned whether such a step would be as straightforward in its legal effects as it might seem at first sight . The Thoburn judgment was handed down only by the Divisional Court ( part of the High Court ) , which occupies a relatively low position in the legal system .
