Balaam finally gets taken by a now very frustrated Balak to Peor , and , after the seven sacrifices there , decides not to `` seek enchantments '' but instead looks upon the Israelites from the peak . The Spirit of God comes upon Balaam and he delivers a third positive prophecy concerning Israel . Balak 's anger rises to the point where he threatens Balaam , but Balaam merely offers a prediction of fate . Balaam then looks upon the Kenites , and Amalekites and offers two more predictions of their fates . Balak and Balaam then go to their respective homes .
