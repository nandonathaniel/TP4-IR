In March 1946 , the Board of Scientific and Industrial Research ( BSIR ) , under the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research ( CSIR ) , set up an Atomic Research Committee under Bhabha 's leadership to explore India 's atomic energy resources and to suggest ways to develop and harness them , along with establishing contacts with similar organisations in other nations . At the same time , the University of Travancore 's research council met to discuss Travancore 's future industrial development . Among other matters , the council made recommendations for developing the state 's resources of monazite , a valuable thorium ore , and ilmenite , with regard to their applications in atomic energy . The council suggested the project could be undertaken by an all - India programme . This was followed by the deputation of Bhabha and Sir Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar , the Director of the CSIR , to Travancore in April 1947 and the establishment of a working relationship with the kingdom 's dewan , Sir C.P. Ramaswami Iyer .
