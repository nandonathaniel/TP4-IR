Now that the mermaids have been identified , Dr. Denman continues her pursuit of them by holding Lewis hostage on her boat and using his mobile phone to lure the girls to the Moon Pool , where she traps them . After discovering that the three mermaids are in fact Rikki and her friends , Zane is left torn about where his loyalties lie ; with his father , or with Rikki . Eventually , his conscience leads him to set Lewis and the girls free ( much to his father and Dr. Denman 's annoyance ) , but the mermaids are not out of trouble yet . Knowing that Dr. Denman and the scientists will still come after them , the girls must make a tough decision . Miss Chatham tells them of the forthcoming lunar eclipse , and says that , if they enter the Moon Pool when the eclipse passes over it , it will draw their powers away from them . As normal girls , the three of them would be of no interest to the scientists , and would be out of danger . The girls make the choice to enter the pool , and while their powers seem to vanish completely , the next morning they find they 've become mermaids again : the eclipse only affected them for 12 hours .
