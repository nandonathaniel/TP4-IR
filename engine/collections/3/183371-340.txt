is the kinematic pressure , where p ( \ displaystyle p ) is the pressure and ρ 0 ( \ displaystyle \ rho _ ( 0 ) ) constant mass density . The SI unit of P is m / s . Kinematic pressure is used in the same manner as kinematic viscosity ν ( \ displaystyle \ nu ) in order to compute Navier -- Stokes equation without explicitly showing the density ρ 0 ( \ displaystyle \ rho _ ( 0 ) ) .
