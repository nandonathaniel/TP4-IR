Some of the most important historical additions to the system between 1933 and 1964 are almost lost to sight in this long thematic list . Jefferson National Expansion Memorial was the first National Historic Site established under authority of the Historic Sites Act . More importantly , its 37 square blocks embraced a key urban area on the historic St. Louis waterfront -- the first major effort of the NPS , after National Capital Parks , to conserve and develop a large and important urban historic site . Some architectural monuments , including the Old St. Louis Post Office and the Cathedral , have been carefully preserved , but the main feature of the area is the only major national memorial of modern design in the United States , and one of a small number in the world -- Eero Saarinen 's stainless steel Arch .
