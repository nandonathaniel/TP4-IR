At a car show where the ICCA winners are due to perform , the Bellas scout their replacements , DSM , led by intimidating duo Pieter Kr√§mer and Kommissar , who take delight in mocking the all - girl group . Later , the Bellas are invited to an exclusive riff - off against DSM . Also in attendance are the Treblemakers , Tone Hangers ( a group of former Treblemakers , including Bumper ) , and the Green Bay Packers . The Bellas make it to the final two , but end up losing to DSM in the final round when a nervous Emily flubs an attempt to sing `` Flashlight , '' her original song not from the right category ( `` 90 's Hip - Hop Jamz '' ) .
