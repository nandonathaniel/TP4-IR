Despite historical consumer preference for refined flour and the traditionally higher per - unit cost of whole grain , whole - wheat flour products are ascendant largely due to changing consumer attitudes . The Whole Grains Council industry association reports an approximate doubling of the whole - wheat flour production over the course of the years 2003 to 2007 . In another visible example , whole - wheat bread has reached approximate parity with soft white bread as measured by slice volume in the United States ; as of 2010 , whole - wheat bread narrowly exceeds soft white bread as measured by dollar volume .
