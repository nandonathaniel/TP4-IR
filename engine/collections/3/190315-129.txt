In June 2010 , The New York Times reported that American geologists were conducting ground surveys on dry salt lakes in western Afghanistan believing that large deposits of lithium are located there . `` Pentagon officials said that their initial analysis at one location in Ghazni Province showed the potential for lithium deposits as large as those of Bolivia , which now has the world 's largest known lithium reserves . '' These estimates are `` based principally on old data , which was gathered mainly by the Soviets during their occupation of Afghanistan from 1979 -- 1989 '' . Stephen Peters , the head of the USGS 's Afghanistan Minerals Project , said that he was unaware of USGS involvement in any new surveying for minerals in Afghanistan in the past two years . ' We are not aware of any discoveries of lithium , ' he said . ''
