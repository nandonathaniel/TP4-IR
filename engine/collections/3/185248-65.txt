Tank farms , containing 140 million U.S. gallons ( 530 million liters ) of bunker oil , were unscathed , providing a ready source of fuel for American fleets at the submarine base . About this missed opportunity , Admiral Chester Nimitz would later say , `` Had the Japanese destroyed the oil , it would have prolonged the war another two years . '' These were vital to the initial phase of the war , and to commerce raiding throughout , and illustrate the deficiencies of Japanese planning for the attack . The Navy Yard , critical to ship maintenance , and repair of ships damaged in the attack was untouched . The engineering and initial repair shops , as well as the torpedo store , were intact . Other items of base infrastructure and operation , such as power generation , continued to operate normally . Also critical to the way the Pacific War was actually fought was the cryptanalysis unit , Station HYPO , located in the basement of the old Administration Building . It was undamaged and even benefited by gaining staff from unemployed ship 's bands .
