The Germans embraced the machine gun from the outset -- in 1904 , sixteen units were equipped with the ' Maschinengewehr ' -- and the machine gun crews were the elite infantry units ; these units were attached to Jaeger ( light infantry ) battalions . By 1914 , British infantry units were armed with two Vickers machine guns per battalion ; the Germans had six per battalion , and the Russians eight . It would not be until 1917 that every infantry unit of the American forces carried at least one machine gun . After 1915 , the Maschinengewehr 08 was the standard issue German machine gun ; its number `` 08 / 15 '' entered the German language as idiomatic for `` dead plain '' . At Gallipoli and in Palestine the Turks provided the infantry , but it was usually Germans who manned the machine guns .
