Things only got worse for the Eagles . They lost a Sunday night match - up to their division rival , the Washington Redskins 17 - 10 . Then , when they went home and played a rematch with their much - hated rival , the Cowboys , on Monday Night Football , a late game interception by Roy Williams sealed their doom . Not only did they lose 21 - 20 , but the already suffering Donovan McNabb got shoved to the ground , worsening his sports hernia and ending his season .
