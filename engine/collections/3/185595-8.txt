The Oath signified for the first time that French citizens formally stood in opposition to Louis XVI , and the National Assembly 's refusal to back down forced the king to make concessions . It was foreshadowed by , and drew considerably from , the 1776 United States Declaration of Independence , especially the preamble . The Oath also inspired a wide variety of revolutionary activity in the months afterwards , ranging from rioting across the French countryside to renewed calls for a written French constitution . Likewise , it reinforced the Assembly 's strength and forced the King to formally request that voting occur based on head , not power . The Tennis Court Oath , which was taken in June 1789 , preceded the 4 August 1789 abolition of feudalism and the 26 August 1789 Declaration of the Rights of Man and Citizen .
