Of the diseases that have been identified as potential biological control agents , the fungal pathogen Myrothecium verrucaria has been shown to be very promising . Disease development is very high at around 30 ° C to 40 ° C , which matches field conditions . In addition , the fungus does not spread outside of areas where it is applied . However , one major drawback of this biological control agent is that it is highly toxic to mammals , so extreme care would have to be taken in handling this organism . Other pathogens have been tested as potential biological control agents , but have proven to be ineffective .
