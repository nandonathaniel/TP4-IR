On the 11 June episode of Raw , as part of the 2007 WWE draft , Khali was drafted from Raw to SmackDown as SmackDown 's first draft pick . In July , Khali began a feud with Batista and the two were scheduled for a match at The Great American Bash . However , because Edge vacated the World Heavyweight Championship due to a legitimate injury , a twenty - man battle royal was held for the title on the 20 July edition of SmackDown ! which Khali won after eliminating both Kane and Batista in one move , thus winning his first World Heavyweight Championship . Khali dominated and defeated both Batista and Kane in a triple threat match at The Great American Bash on 22 July . Khali then debuted a new finisher called the Khali Vise Grip ( a two - handed clawhold ) which he used to wear down Batista , Kane and Ric Flair .
