Deke Slayton , as director of flight crew operations , had primary responsibility for assigning crews for the Gemini program . Each flight had a primary crew and backup crew , and the backup crew would rotate to primary crew status three flights later . Slayton intended for first choice of mission commands to be given to the four remaining active astronauts of the Mercury Seven : Alan Shepard , Grissom , Cooper , and Schirra . ( John Glenn had retired from NASA in January 1964 and Scott Carpenter , who was blamed by some in NASA management for the problematic reentry of Aurora 7 , was on leave to participate in the Navy 's SEALAB project and was grounded from flight in July 1964 due to an arm injury sustained in a motorbike accident . Slayton himself continued to be grounded due to a heart problem . )
