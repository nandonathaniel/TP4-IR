Most communication ( e.g. HTML and IP ) and storage ( e.g. for Unix ) was designed for a stream of bytes . A UTF - 16 string must use a pair of bytes for each code unit : The order of those two bytes becomes an issue and must be specified in the UTF - 16 protocol , such as with a byte order mark . If an odd number of bytes is missing from UTF - 16 , the whole rest of the string will be meaningless text . Any bytes missing from UTF - 8 will still allow the text to be recovered accurately starting with the next character after the missing bytes .
