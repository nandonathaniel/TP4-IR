The All Terrain Open Transport ( AT - OT ) , also seen in Revenge of the Sith and other sources , is a heavily armored transport whose open design makes it vulnerable from above . The AT - OT can transport 34 clone troopers , who are protected by thick armor and four laser cannons . During the late stages of Revenge of the Sith 's development , it was called the `` Clone CAT walker '' .
