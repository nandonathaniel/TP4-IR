Malnourished human children have less mature and less diverse gut microbiota than healthy children , and changes in the microbiome associated with nutrient scarcity can in turn be a pathophysiological cause of malnutrition . Malnourished children also typically have more potentially pathogenic gut flora , and more yeast in their mouths and throats . Altering diet may lead to changes in gut microbiota composition and diversity .
