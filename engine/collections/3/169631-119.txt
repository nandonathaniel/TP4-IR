Agamemnon had made it back to Argos safely with Cassandra in his possession after some stormy weather . He and Cassandra were slain by Aegisthus ( in the oldest versions of the story ) or by Clytemnestra or by both of them . Electra and Orestes later avenged their father , but Orestes was the one who was chased by the Furies .
