While infant mortality is normally negatively correlated with GDP , there may indeed be some opposing short - term effects from a recession . A recent study by The Economist showed that economic slowdowns reduce the amount of air pollution , which results in a lower infant mortality rate . In the late 1970s and early 1980s , the recession 's impact on air quality is estimated to have saved around 1,300 US babies . It is only during deep recessions that infant mortality increases . According to Norbert Schady and Marc - Fran√ßois Smitz , recessions when GDP per capita drops by 15 % or more increase infant mortality .
