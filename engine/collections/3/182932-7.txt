For example : the similarity of southern continent geological formations had led Roberto Mantovani to conjecture in 1889 and 1909 that all the continents had once been joined into a supercontinent ; Wegener noted the similarity of Mantovani 's and his own maps of the former positions of the southern continents . In Mantovani 's conjecture , this continent broke due to volcanic activity caused by thermal expansion , and the new continents drifted away from each other because of further expansion of the rip - zones , where the oceans now lie . This led Mantovani to propose an Expanding Earth theory which has since been shown to be incorrect .
