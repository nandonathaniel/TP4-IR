Ancient Greek philosophers , from Thales ( fl. 550 BC ) through even to the Roman period , developed an elaborate theory of what they termed the psucháº½ ( from which the first half of `` psychology '' is derived ) , as well as other `` psychological '' terms -- nous , thumos , logistikon , etc . The most influential of these are the accounts of Plato ( especially in the Republic ) , Pythagoras and of Aristotle ( esp . Peri Psyches , better known under its Latin title , De Anima ) . Hellenistic philosophers ( viz. , the Stoics and Epicurians ) diverged from the Classical Greek tradition in several important ways , especially in their concern with questions of the physiological basis of the mind . The Roman physician Galen addressed these issues most elaborately and influentially of all . The Greek tradition influenced some Christian and Islamic thought on the topic .
