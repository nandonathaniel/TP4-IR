A bitumen - surfaced second runway was built at No. 1 Airstrip by No. 6 Mobile Works Squadron RAAF , after which the original runway was only used for emergencies and taxiing . The minefield around No. 3 Airstrip was lifted and the airstrip was completed , with revetments and hardstands for 70 medium bombers . A new wharf , known as Liles ' wharf after the American engineer who supervised its construction , was built in September and October 1942 . This was capable of handling Liberty ships . Henceforth ships could sail direct to Milne Bay from the United States , reducing the pressure on Australian ports and saving two or three days ' sailing time plus the time taken to unload and then reload the cargo on smaller ships . PT boats were based at Milne Bay from December 1942 , and a transhipment and staging area , overhaul facilities for PT boats , a destroyer base and Station Hospital were also constructed . Milne Bay was used as a staging area for mounting the landing at Lae in September 1943 , and the New Britain Campaign in December . The base at Milne Bay remained operational until the end of the war .
