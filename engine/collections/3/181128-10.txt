A commonly referred to transition is the evolution of Isurus hastalis , the Extinct Giant Mako , into the Great White shark , Carcharodon carcharias . There exist teeth that are believed to represent the transition between the two species . These teeth , from Carcharodon sp . are characterised by the wider , flatter crowns of the Extinct Giant Mako . However , they also exhibit partial , fading serrations , which are more pronounced near the root , and disappear towards the tip of the tooth - serrations being found in Great Whites but not Extinct Giant Makos .
