The Laves graph or K crystal is a theoretically - predicted three - dimensional crystalline metastable carbon structure in which each carbon atom is bonded to three others , at 120 ° angles ( like graphite ) , but where the bond planes of adjacent layers lie at an angle of 70.5 ° , rather than coinciding
