Older constitutions often vest this power in the cabinet . In the United Kingdom , for example , the tradition whereby it is the prime minister who requests a dissolution of parliament dates back to 1918 . Prior to then , it was the entire government that made the request . Similarly , though the modern 1937 Irish constitution grants to the Taoiseach the right to make the request , the earlier 1922 Irish Free State Constitution vested the power in the Executive Council ( the then name for the Irish cabinet ) .
