In 17th - century Spain , painters rarely enjoyed high social status . Painting was regarded as a craft , not an art such as poetry or music . Nonetheless , Vel√°zquez worked his way up through the ranks of the court of Philip IV , and in February 1651 was appointed palace chamberlain ( aposentador mayor del palacio ) . The post brought him status and material reward , but its duties made heavy demands on his time . During the remaining eight years of his life , he painted only a few works , mostly portraits of the royal family . When he painted Las Meninas , he had been with the royal household for 33 years .
