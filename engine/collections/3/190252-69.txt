Great signs are these of the Terrestrial Paradise , for the site conforms to the opinion of the holy and wise theologians whom I have mentioned . And likewise , the ( other ) signs conform very well , for I have never read or heard of such a large quantity of fresh water being inside and in such close proximity to salt water ; the very mild temperateness also corroborates this ; and if the water of which I speak does not proceed from Paradise then it is an even greater marvel , because I do not believe such a large and deep river has ever been known to exist in this world .
