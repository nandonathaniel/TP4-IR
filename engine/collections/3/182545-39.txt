Critical opinions of Jasmine have been generally mixed ; some critics appreciated the character for continuing to `` break the mold '' that had been established by Disney 's earliest princesses . Ty Burr of Entertainment Weekly described Jasmine as Disney 's `` most full - bodied '' heroine , while Desson Howe of The Washington Post commended the character for providing the film with `` feminist consciousness '' . The Christian Science Monitor 's David Sterrit wrote that Jasmine `` is less carefully worked out ( than Aladdin ) but equally likable as a personality type . '' Contactmusic.com agreed that the character exhibits `` likeably cynical streaks '' despite being an `` essentially bland '' character . Gary Thompson of the Philadelphia Daily News wrote , `` Princess Jasmine is also more barbed , yet without the obvious feminist makeover given to Belle '' . Similarly , James Berardinelli of ReelViews commended Jasmine for `` show ( ing ) the same streak of stubborn independence exhibited by Ariel and Belle , '' but ultimately criticized the fact that `` she does n't fill a more pressing role than that of Aladdin 's ' love interest . ' '' Agreeing that Jasmine appears `` bland '' in comparison to Aladdin 's supporting characters , Mari Ness of Tor.com wrote , `` Jasmine follows in the footsteps of Ariel and Belle as someone unhappy with the restrictions of her world and her lack of choices : like both of them , she takes active steps to change this , and it 's not entirely her fault that she 's a secondary character in a film not all that interested in her ... She 's perceptive , and fast thinking , but this is n't her movie , and in the end , although she does get to choose her own husband , she does n't really get a chance , like Ariel and Belle , to move out of her world . She can be shown the world , but she stays in her palace . ''
