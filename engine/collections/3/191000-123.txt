Plumer ordered the attack on 26 September to go ahead but reduced the objectives of the 33rd Division . The 98th Brigade was to advance and cover the right flank of the 5th Australian Division and the 100th Brigade was to re-capture the lost ground further south . The 5th Australian Division advance the next day began with uncertainty as to the security of the right flank ; the attack of the depleted 98th Brigade was delayed and only managed to reach Black Watch Corner , 1,000 yd ( 910 m ) short of its objectives . Reinforcements moved into the 5th Australian Division area and attacked south - westwards at noon , as a frontal attack was made from Black Watch Corner without artillery support , because British troops were known to be holding out . The attack succeeded by 2 : 00 p.m. ; later in the afternoon , the 100th Brigade re-took the ground lost north of the Menin road . Casualties in the 33rd Division were so great that it was relieved on 27 September by the 23rd Division , which had only been withdrawn on the night of 24 / 25 September .
