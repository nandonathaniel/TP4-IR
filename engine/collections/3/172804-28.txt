It was reported in September 2015 that Ottawa would host the Grey Cup game , and that it would be determined at a board of governor 's meeting later that Fall . It was stated by the Ottawa Redblacks ownership group , Ottawa Sports and Entertainment Group , that one of the clauses in their expansion agreement was that the club would host a Grey Cup game within their first four years of existence . Since the Redblacks entered the league in 2014 , 2017 would be the fourth such year . Ottawa had previously been awarded the 102nd Grey Cup but backed out due to construction delays ; that game would be held in Vancouver instead .
