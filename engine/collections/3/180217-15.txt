This subregion is mostly submerged - it is only exposed at the point of low tide and for a longer period of time during extremely low tides . This area is teeming with life ; the most notable difference with this subregion to the other three is that there is much more marine vegetation , especially seaweeds . There is also a great biodiversity . Organisms in this zone generally are not well adapted to periods of dryness and temperature extremes . Some of the organisms in this area are abalone , sea anemones , brown seaweed , chitons , crabs , green algae , hydroids , isopods , limpets , mussels , nudibranchs , sculpin , sea cucumber , sea lettuce , sea palms , starfish , sea urchins , shrimp , snails , sponges , surf grass , tube worms , and whelks . Creatures in this area can grow to larger sizes because there is more available energy in the localized ecosystem . Also , marine vegetation can grow to much greater sizes than in the other three intertidal subregions due to the better water coverage . The water is shallow enough to allow plenty of light to reach the vegetation to allow substantial photosynthetic activity , and the salinity is at almost normal levels . This area is also protected from large predators such as fish because of the wave action and the relatively shallow water .
