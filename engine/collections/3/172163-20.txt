A telesync ( TS ) is a bootleg recording of a film recorded in a movie theater , sometimes filmed using a professional camera on a tripod in the projection booth . The main difference between a CAM and TS copy is that the audio of a TS is captured with a direct connection to the sound source ( often an FM microbroadcast provided for the hearing - impaired , or from a drive - in theater ) . Often , a cam is mislabeled as a telesync . HDTS is used to label a High - definition video recording .
