In December 2006 , ARC became a founding partner of the Malaria No More campaign . The campaign was formed by leading non-governmental organizations to inspire individuals , institutions , and organizations in the private sector to support a comprehensive approach to end malaria , a devastating but preventable disease . ARC supported local Red Cross and Red Crescent volunteers in Africa who educated families and communities about malaria prevention and treatment , such as the proper and consistent use of insecticide - treated bed nets . ARC provided technical assistance and capacity - building support to its partners in difficult - to - reach communities .
