Longstanding differences in national interest and political stance among China , the United States , and the United Kingdom remained in place . British Prime Minister Winston Churchill was reluctant to devote British troops , many of whom had been routed by the Japanese in earlier campaigns , to the reopening of the Burma Road ; Stilwell , on the other hand , believed that reopening the road was vital , as all China 's mainland ports were under Japanese control . The Allies ' `` Europe First '' policy did not sit well with Chiang , while the later British insistence that China send more and more troops to Indochina for use in the Burma Campaign was seen by Chiang as an attempt to use Chinese manpower to defend British colonial holdings . Chiang also believed that China should divert its crack army divisions from Burma to eastern China to defend the airbases of the American bombers that he hoped would defeat Japan through bombing , a strategy that American general Claire Lee Chennault supported but which Stilwell strongly opposed . In addition , Chiang voiced his support of Indian independence in a 1942 meeting with Mahatma Gandhi , which further soured the relationship between China and the United Kingdom .
