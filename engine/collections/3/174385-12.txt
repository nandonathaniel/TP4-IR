It is unknown what the earliest version of the rhyme was or when it began . Many incarnations of the game have a group of children form a ring , dance in a circle around a person , and stoop or curtsy with the final line . The slowest child to do so is faced with a penalty or becomes the `` rosie '' ( literally : rose tree , from the French rosier ) and takes their place in the center of the ring .
