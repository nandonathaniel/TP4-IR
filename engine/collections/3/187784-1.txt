Due to Florida 's low latitude and subtropical climate , temperatures cold enough to support significant snowfall are infrequent and their duration is fleeting . In general , frost is more common than snow , requiring temperatures of 32 ° F ( 0 ° C ) or less at 2 m ( 7 ft ) above sea level , a cloudless sky , and a relative humidity of 65 % or more . Generally , for snow to occur , the polar jet stream must move southward through Texas and into the Gulf of Mexico , with a stalled cold front across the southern portion of the state curving northeastward to combine freezing air into the frontal clouds . While light snowfall occurs a few times each decade across the northern panhandle , most of the state is too far south of the cold continental air masses responsible for generating snowfall in the rest of the country . The mean maximum monthly snowfall in most parts of Florida is zero . The only other areas in the continental United States with this distinction are extreme southern Texas and parts of coastal southern California .
