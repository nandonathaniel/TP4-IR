In the late 1980s and early 1990s , hip - hop started to capture the imagination of America 's youth . R&B started to become homogenized , with a group of high profile producers responsible for most R&B hits . It was hard for R&B artists of the era to sell their music or even have their music heard because of the rise of hip - hop , but some adopted a `` hip - hop '' image , were marketed as such , and often featured rappers on their songs . Newer artists such as Usher , R. Kelly , TLC , Aaliyah , Beyonc√© , Christina Aguilera , and Mary J. Blige , enjoyed success . L.A. Reid , the CEO of LaFace Records , was responsible for some of R&B 's greatest successes in the 1990s in the form of Usher , TLC and Toni Braxton . Later , Reid successfully marketed Boyz II Men . In 2004 , 80 % of the songs that topped the R&B charts , were also on top of the Hot 100 . That period was the all - time peak for R&B and hip hop on the Billboard Hot 100 , and on Top 40 Radio . From about 2005 to 2013 , R&B sales declined . However ; since 2010 Hip - Hop has started to take from the R&B sound choosing to adopt a softer smoother sound incorporating that of traditional R&B with rappers such as Drake and Fetty Wap who have opened an entire new door for the genre . This sound has gained in popularity and created great controversy for both Hip - Hop and R&B in how to identify it .
