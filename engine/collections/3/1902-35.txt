Bacterial microcompartments are widespread , membrane - bound organelles that are made of a protein shell that surrounds and encloses various enzymes . provide a further level of organization ; they are compartments within bacteria that are surrounded by polyhedral protein shells , rather than by lipid membranes . These `` polyhedral organelles '' localize and compartmentalize bacterial metabolism , a function performed by the membrane - bound organelles in eukaryotes .
