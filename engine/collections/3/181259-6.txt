The emergency brake was originally intended for one particular emergency and that was `` no other way to stop '' , as was the case when the footbrake suddenly failed due to a loss of hydraulic pressure or other issue . Drivers had to respond when brakes failed , so they were expected to learn how to stop a speeding vehicle using the emergency brake alone . Safety regulations became almost universal by 1980 , so modern brake systems are very reliable , using dual - circuit hydraulics and more recently low - brake - fluid sensors . As modern brakes no longer cause emergencies in normal contexts ( a brake warning light comes on after the first sign of trouble ) , it is no longer necessary for the average driver to learn to use this brake for emergencies .
