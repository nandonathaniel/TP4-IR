In 2000 , in the lead - up to the release of the first Harry Potter film , Harry Potter and the Philosopher 's Stone ; Warner Bros. , the film 's distributor , sent a series of letters to owners of Harry Potter fansites , demanding that , to protect their copyright , they hand over their domain names . The action resulted in negative publicity for the company when Claire Field , the then 15 - year - old webmaster of the British fansite harrypotterguide.co.uk , was reduced to tears by what were described by her father as unnecessary bully tactics . Eventually the corporation backed down in the face of media opposition and declared that , as the site was non-commercial , it did not violate the trademark .
