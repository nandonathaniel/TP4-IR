The aim of the act was to establish a uniform two tier system across the country . Onto the blank canvas , new counties were created to cover the entire country ; many of these were obviously based on the historic counties , but there were some major changes , especially in the north . The tiny county of Rutland was joined with Leicestershire ; Cumberland , Westmorland and the Furness exclave of Lancashire were fused into the new county of Cumbria ; Herefordshire and Worcestershire were joined to form Hereford & Worcester ; the three ridings of Yorkshire were replaced by North , South and West Yorkshire , along with Humberside . The act also created six new ' metropolitan ' counties , modelled on Greater London , to specifically address the problems of administering large conurbations ; these were Greater Manchester , Merseyside , Tyne & Wear , West Yorkshire , South Yorkshire and West Midlands . The new counties of Avon ( the city of Bristol , north Somerset and south Gloucestershire ) , Cleveland ( the Teesside area ) and Humberside were designed with the idea of uniting areas based on river estuaries .
