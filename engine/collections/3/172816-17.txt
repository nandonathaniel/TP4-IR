For popular events with sold out tickets , re-sellers may sell the tickets at several times the face value . If re-sellers buy the tickets and the tickets are not then sold out , then they risk a loss . There may be individuals who wish to attend a popular event ( and decide to sell their tickets later ) and those that buy tickets in large quantities in order to resell their tickets for a profit . Some countries have restricted the unauthorized resale of tickets .
