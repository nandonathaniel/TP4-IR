The cloistered sisters live a penitential life of prayer , study , community and work . They are consecrated to God by public profession ( of simple , private vows ) of the evangelical counsels of chastity , poverty and obedience . They have the full Habit , monastic customs and regular observances of the nuns of the Order of Preachers . This community is under jurisdiction of the local Ordinary , or Bishop . This community , however , though descended from a Second Order Monastery , is not a member of the Second Order of Friars Preachers and has yet to gain full recognition by the Dominican Order . They have the status of public association of the faithful , and have simple , private vows . They have constitutional rather than Papal enclosure . While awaiting pontifical recognition , the Lockport foundation adheres to the ideals and practices of the nuns of the Order of Preachers , though , again , not being member of the said Second Order and , for the time being , is of diocesan right as an autonomous juridic person , with canonical status in the Diocese of Houma - Thibodaux . Technically they are not `` nuns '' because only religious who profess solemn vows can rightly be called ' nuns ' . Since they only have simple , private vows they are not technically religious .
