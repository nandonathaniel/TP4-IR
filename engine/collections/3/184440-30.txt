That evening , Light is compelled to write down the name of Antony Skomal , the man who killed his mother in a hit and run . Skomal dies in a similar freak accident at a restaurant .

Classmate Mia Sutton asks Light about the Death Note , and he demonstrates how it works . She encourages Light to use the Death Note with her to rid the world of criminals , improving the world .
