In 2002 , it was reportedly proposed to the then current UN Secretary General Kofi Annan that the UN develops a ' Semi-Official ' or ' Regional ' language status for commonly spoken languages that do not have Official status so that a higher percentage of the worlds population could be familiar with UN actions . As of 2006 , the six official languages are the first or second language of 2.8 billion people on the planet , which is less than half of the world population . The list of potential ' Semi-Official ' or ' Regional ' languages , many of which can be considered lingua francas in their areas , could include : Amharic , Bengali , Burmese , Cantonese , Chichewa , Fula , German , Gujarati , Hausa , Hindi , Igbo , Indonesian , Italian , Japanese , Javanese , Kannada , Korean , Lingala , Malay , Marathi , Oromo , Pashto , Persian , Portuguese , Punjabi , Shanghaiese , Shona , Swahili , Tagalog , Tamil , Telugu , Thai , Turkish , Vietnamese , Urdu , Yoruba , Zulu , International Sign Language , International Braille , and possibly an international auxiliary language such as Esperanto , Ido , or Interlingua . As of 2017 , the UN has taken no public action to approve a `` Semi-Official '' or `` Regional '' status mainly due to expected translation costs .
