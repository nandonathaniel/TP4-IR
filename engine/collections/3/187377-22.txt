Production of the penny ceased in May 2012 , and the Royal Canadian Mint ceased the distribution of them as of February 4 , 2013 . However , like all discontinued currency in the Canadian monetary system , the coin remains legal tender . Once distribution of the coin ceased , though , vendors were no longer expected to return pennies as change for cash purchases , and were encouraged to round purchases to the nearest five cents . Non-cash transactions are still denominated to the cent .
