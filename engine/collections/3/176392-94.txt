A Bug 's Life was the first ever home video release to be entirely created using a digital transfer , with every single frame of animation being readded from the film 's computer data as opposed to the standard analog film - to - videotape transfer process . This allowed for the film 's DVD release to retain its original 2 : 35 : 1 anamorphic widescreen format which it was presented with in movie theaters . The DVD was released on DVD on April 20 , 1999 alongside a VHS release which was presented in a standard 1 : 33 : 1 `` fullscreen '' format . The movie 's fullscreen transfer was performed by entirely `` reframing '' the film shot by shot ; more than half of the film 's footage was modified by Pixar animators in order for them to fit within the film 's aspect ratio , with several characters and objects being moved closer together in order to avoid being cut out of frame . The film 's VHS release was the best - selling VHS in the United Kingdom , with 1.76 million units sold by the end of the year .
