As part of the colonization process , African slaves were brought to the island in 1513 . Following the decline of the Ta√≠no population , more slaves were brought to Puerto Rico ; however , the number of slaves on the island paled in comparison to those in neighboring islands . Also , early in the colonization of Puerto Rico , attempts were made to wrest control of Puerto Rico from Spain . The Caribs , a raiding tribe of the Caribbean , attacked Spanish settlements along the banks of the Daguao and Macao rivers in 1514 and again in 1521 but each time they were easily repelled by the superior Spanish firepower . However , these would not be the last attempts at control of Puerto Rico . The European powers quickly realized the potential of the newly discovered lands and attempted to gain control of them . Nonetheless , Puerto Rico remained a Spanish possession until the 19th century .
