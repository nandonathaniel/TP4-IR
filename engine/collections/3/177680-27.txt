The online multiplayer allows up to eight players to engage in competitive gameplay in recreations of multiple single - player settings . The game features three multiplayer game types : Supply Raid and Survivors are both team deathmatches , with the latter excluding the ability to respawn ; Interrogation features teams investigating the location of the enemy team 's lockbox , and the first to capture such lockbox wins . In every mode , players select a faction -- Hunters ( a group of hostile survivors ) or Fireflies ( a revolutionary militia group ) -- and keep their clan alive by collecting supplies during matches . Each match is equal to one day ; by surviving twelve `` weeks '' , players have completed a journey and can re-select their Faction . Killing enemies , reviving allies , and crafting items earn the player parts that can be converted to supplies ; parts can also be scavenged from enemies ' bodies . Players are able to carry more equipment by earning points as their clan 's supplies grow . Players can connect the game to their Facebook account , which alters clan members ' names and faces to match the players ' Facebook friends . Players have the ability to customize their characters with hats , helmets , masks , and emblems .
