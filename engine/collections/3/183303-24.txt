The episode was both written and directed by Paul Lieberstein , who also plays the part of Toby Flenderson on the show . In the episode , Jim refers to a TripAdvisor page for Dwight 's bed and breakfast . This can be found by searching for Schrute Farms . Jim and Pam ( `` JandP2 '' ) post a review , which can be seen on the actual reviews page . It reads : `` The architecture reminds one of a quaint Tuscan beet farm , and the natural aroma of the beets drifts into the bedrooms and makes you dream of simpler times . You will never want to leave your room . The informative lecture will satisfy all your beet curiosity , and the dawn goose walk will tug at your heart strings . Table making never seemed so possible . Great story to tell your friends . Plenty of parking ! The staff 's attention to detail and devotion to cleanliness was limitless . From their enthusiastic welcome to the last wave good - bye , Schrute Farms delivers . ''
