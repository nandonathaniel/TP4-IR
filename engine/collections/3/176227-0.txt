Points between the cardinal directions form the points of the compass . The intermediate ( intercardinal or ordinal ) directions are northeast ( NE ) , southeast ( SE ) , southwest ( SW ) , and northwest ( NW ) . The intermediate direction of every set of intercardinal and cardinal direction is called a secondary - intercardinal direction , the eight shortest points in the compass rose that is shown to the right ( e.g. , NNE , ENE , and ESE ) .
