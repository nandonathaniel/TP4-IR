Commencing in 1965 , experimentally , the August Bank Holiday weekend was observed at the end of August `` to give a lead in extending British holidays over a longer summer period '' . Each year 's date was announced in Parliament on an ad - hoc basis , to the despair of the calendar and diary publishing trade . The rule seems to have been to select the weekend of the last Saturday in August , so that in 1968 and 1969 Bank Holiday Monday actually fell in September .
