The Chinese room has a design analogous to that of a modern computer . It has a Von Neumann architecture , which consists of a program ( the book of instructions ) , some memory ( the papers and file cabinets ) , a CPU which follows the instructions ( the man ) , and a means to write symbols in memory ( the pencil and eraser ) . A machine with this design is known in theoretical computer science as `` Turing complete '' , because it has the necessary machinery to carry out any computation that a Turing machine can do , and therefore it is capable of doing a step - by - step simulation of any other digital machine , given enough memory and time . Alan Turing writes , `` all digital computers are in a sense equivalent . '' The widely accepted Church - Turing thesis holds that any function computable by an effective procedure is computable by a Turing machine .
