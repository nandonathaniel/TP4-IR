In February 1848 , the workers and petite bourgeoisie had fought together , but now , in June 1848 , the lines were drawn differently . The working classes had been abandoned by the bourgeois politicians who founded the provisional government . This would prove fatal to the Second Republic , which , without the support of the working classes , could not continue . Although the governmental regime of the Second Republic continued to survive until December 1852 , the generous , idealistic Republic to which the February Days had given birth , ended with the suppression of the `` June Days '' .
