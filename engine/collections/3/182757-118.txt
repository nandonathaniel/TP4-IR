In 1588 , hoping to put a stop to Elizabeth 's intervention , Philip sent the Spanish Armada to invade England . Unfavourable weather , plus heavily armed and man≈ìuvrable English ships , and the fact that the English had been warned by their spies in the Netherlands and were ready for the attack resulted in a defeat for the Armada . However , the failure of the Drake -- Norris Expedition to Portugal and the Azores in 1589 marked a turning point in the on - off 1585 -- 1604 Anglo -- Spanish War . The Spanish fleets became more effective in transporting greatly increased quantities of silver and gold from the Americas , while English attacks suffered costly failures .
