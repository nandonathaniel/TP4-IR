The 787 was designed to be the first production airliner with the fuselage comprising one - piece composite barrel sections instead of the multiple aluminum sheets and some 50,000 fasteners used on existing aircraft . Boeing selected two new engines to power the 787 , the Rolls - Royce Trent 1000 and General Electric GEnx . Boeing stated the 787 would be approximately 20 percent more fuel - efficient than the 767 , with approximately 40 percent of the efficiency gain from the engines , plus gains from aerodynamic improvements , increased use of lighter - weight composite materials , and advanced systems . The airframe underwent extensive structural testing during its design . The 787 - 8 and âˆ’ 9 were intended to have a certified 330 minute ETOPS capability .
