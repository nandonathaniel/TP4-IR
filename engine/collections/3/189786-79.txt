Dewey 's educational theories were presented in My Pedagogic Creed ( 1897 ) , The School and Society ( 1900 ) , The Child and the Curriculum ( 1902 ) , Democracy and Education ( 1916 ) , Schools of To - morrow ( c1915 ) with Evelyn Dewey , and Experience and Education ( 1938 ) . Several themes recur throughout these writings . Dewey continually argues that education and learning are social and interactive processes , and thus the school itself is a social institution through which social reform can and should take place . In addition , he believed that students thrive in an environment where they are allowed to experience and interact with the curriculum , and all students should have the opportunity to take part in their own learning .
