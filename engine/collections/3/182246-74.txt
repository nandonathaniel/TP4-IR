Considerable attention has been paid to the strategies learners use to learn a second language . Strategies have been found to be of critical importance , so much so that strategic competence has been suggested as a major component of communicative competence . Strategies are commonly divided into learning strategies and communicative strategies , although there are other ways of categorizing them . Learning strategies are techniques used to improve learning , such as mnemonics or using a dictionary . Communicative strategies are strategies a learner uses to convey meaning even when he or she does n't have access to the correct form , such as using pro-forms like thing , or using non-verbal means such as gestures . If learning strategies and communicative strategies are used properly language acquisition is successful . Some points to keep in mind while learning an additional language are : providing information that is of interest to the student , offering opportunities for the student to share their knowledge and teaching appropriate techniques for the uses of the learning resources available .
