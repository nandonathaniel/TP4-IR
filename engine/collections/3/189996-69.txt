Numerous Indian removal treaties were signed . Most American Indians reluctantly but peacefully complied with the terms of the removal treaties , often with bitter resignation . Some groups , however , went to war to resist the implementation of these treaties , e.g. , two short wars ( the Black Hawk War of 1832 and the Creek War of 1836 ) , as well as the long and costly Second Seminole War ( 1835 -- 1842 ) .
