Wraiths are hooded creatures that are summoned by an amulet marking its victims . The creature will then hunt the victim down and suck its soul out , transporting it to another world , leaving a lifeless body . According to Regina , these creatures are undead and thus can not be killed again . After the curse is broken in Storybrooke , Mr. Gold ( Rumplestiltskin ) summons a wraith to kill Regina Mills ( the Evil Queen ) for abducting Belle . However , it is stopped by Emma Swan , Mary Margaret Blanchard ( Snow White ) and David Nolan ( Prince Charming ) , before dragging Emma and Mary Margaret into a portal to the remaining part of the Enchanted Forest . Phillip accidentally marked himself with the amulet , having his soul temporarily removed .
