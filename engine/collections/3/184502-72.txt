São Paulo is located in Southeastern Brazil , in southeastern São Paulo State , approximately halfway between Curitiba and Rio de Janeiro . The city is located on a plateau located beyond the Serra do Mar ( Portuguese for `` Sea Range '' or `` Coastal Range '' ) , itself a component of the vast region known as the Brazilian Highlands , with an average elevation of around 799 metres ( 2,621 ft ) above sea level , although being at a distance of only about 70 kilometres ( 43 mi ) from the Atlantic Ocean . The distance is covered by two highways , the Anchieta and the Imigrantes , ( see `` Transportation '' below ) that roll down the range , leading to the port city of Santos and the beach resort of Guarujá . Rolling terrain prevails within the urbanized areas of São Paulo except in its northern area , where the Serra da Cantareira Range reaches a higher elevation and a sizable remnant of the Atlantic Rain Forest . The region is seismically stable and no significant seismic activity has ever been recorded .
