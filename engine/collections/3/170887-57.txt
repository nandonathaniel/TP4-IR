Another example is 1947 . Collins says that Riggs beat Budge in a tour ; McCauley says that there was no long tour , only a short one between Riggs and Frank Kovacs . Tom LeCompte says that there was a small tour with Riggs overcoming Budge 12 - 6 followed by the short Riggs - Kovacs tour ( 4 - 3 , but 11 - 10 according to McCauley ) .
