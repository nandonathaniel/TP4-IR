The amount of rotation of an accurately made screw can be directly and precisely correlated to a certain amount of axial movement ( and vice versa ) , through the constant known as the screw 's lead ( / ˈliːd / ) . A screw 's lead is the distance it moves forward axially with one complete turn ( 360 ° ) . ( In most threads ( that is , in all single - start threads ) , lead and pitch refer to essentially the same concept . ) With an appropriate lead and major diameter of the screw , a given amount of axial movement will be amplified in the resulting circumferential movement .
