The writ of habeas corpus is one of what are called the `` extraordinary '' , `` common law '' , or `` prerogative writs '' , which were historically issued by the English courts in the name of the monarch to control inferior courts and public authorities within the kingdom . The most common of the other such prerogative writs are quo warranto , prohibito , mandamus , procedendo , and certiorari . The due process for such petitions is not simply civil or criminal , because they incorporate the presumption of non-authority . The official who is the respondent must prove his authority to do or not do something . Failing this , the court must decide for the petitioner , who may be any person , not just an interested party . This differs from a motion in a civil process in which the movant must have standing , and bears the burden of proof .
