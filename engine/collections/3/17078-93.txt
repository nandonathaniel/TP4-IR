The strongest level of entrenchment exists in those constitutions that state that some of their most fundamental principles are absolute , i.e. certain articles may not be amended under any circumstances . An amendment of a constitution that is made consistently with that constitution , except that it violates the absolute non-modifiability , can be called an unconstitutional constitutional law . Ultimately it is always possible for a constitution to be overthrown by internal or external force , for example , a revolution ( perhaps claiming to be justified by the right to revolution ) or invasion . In the Constitution of India , the Supreme Court has created the Doctrine of Basic Structure in Kesavananda Bharti 's case ( 1973 ) stating that the essential features of the Basic structure can not be amended by the Parliament . The Court has identified judicial review , independence of Judiciary , free and fair election , core of Fundamental Rights as a few of the essential features which are unamendable . However , the Supreme Court did not identify specific provisions which are in the category of absolute entrenchment . A critical analysis of the Doctrine of Basic Structure appears in Professor M.K. Bhandari 's book Basic Structure of Indian Constitution - A Critical Reconsideration .
