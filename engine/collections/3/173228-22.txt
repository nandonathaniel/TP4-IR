In all game modes , players control characters called champions , chosen or assigned every match , who each have a set of unique abilities . Champions begin every match at a low level , and then gain experience over the course of the match to achieve a maximum level of 18 . Gaining champion levels in matches allows players to unlock their champion 's special abilities and augment them in a number of ways unique to each character . If a champion loses all their health , they are defeated , but are automatically revived in their base after enough time passes . Players also begin each match with a low amount of gold , and can earn additional gold throughout the match in a variety of ways : by killing non-player characters known as minions and monsters ; by killing or helping to kill enemy players ; by destroying enemy structures ; passively over time ; and through unique item interactions or champion abilities . This gold can then be spent throughout the match to buy in - game items that further augment each champion 's abilities and game play in a variety of ways . Champion experience , gold earned , and items bought are specific to each match and do not carry over to subsequent matches . Thus , all players begin each match on more - or-less equal footing relative to their opposing team .
