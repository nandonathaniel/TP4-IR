Translator identified as `` A.F. '' Richmond , Virginia , 1863 . Published by West and Johnston publishers . The Editor 's Preface announces its intention of correcting errors in Wilbour 's translation . It said that some passages `` exclusively intended for the French readers of the book '' were being omitted , as well as `` ( a ) few scattered sentences reflecting on slavery '' because `` the absence of a few antislavery paragraphs will hardly be complained of by Southern readers . '' Because of paper shortages in wartime , the passages omitted became longer with each successive volume .
