Decades of uncontrolled digs followed to fuel the antiques trade , and many of these pieces eventually entered collections in Europe , the US , Canada and Japan . The first Western collector was the American missionary Frank H. Chalfant ( 1862 -- 1914 ) . Chalfant also first coined the term `` oracle bone '' in his 1906 book Early Chinese Writing , which was then borrowed into Chinese as `` jiǎgǔ 甲骨 '' in the 1930s . The Canadian Presbyterian minister James Mellon Menzies ( 1885 -- 1957 ) bought the largest amount . The Chinese still acknowledge the pioneering contribution of Menzies as `` the foremost western scholar of Yin - Shang culture and oracle bone inscriptions . '' His former residence in Anyang was declared a `` Protected Treasure '' in 2004 , and the James Mellon Menzies Memorial Museum for Oracle Bone Studies was established .
