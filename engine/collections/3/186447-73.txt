Prior to the 2009 -- 10 NHL season , the Blackhawks made another major free agent purchase , signing Marian Hossa to a 12 - year contract worth US $62.8 million . The team also acquired Tomas Kopecky , John Madden , and Richard Petiot . In early July , General Manager Dale Tallon and the Blackhawks management came under fire when the National Hockey League Players ' Association ( NHLPA ) claimed the team did not submit offers to their restricted free agents before the deadline . In the worst - case scenario , the team 's unsigned restricted free agents at the time , including Calder Memorial Trophy finalist Kris Versteeg , would have become unrestricted free agents . Despite the ordeal , the Blackhawks were able to sign Versteeg and all of their restricted free agents before the NHLPA could take further actions . On July 14 , 2009 , The Blackhawks demoted Tallon to the position of Senior Adviser . Stan Bowman , son of Scotty Bowman , was promoted to general manager . The Blackhawks continued to sell out games , with the best average attendance of 21,356 over Montreal 's 21,273 in the NHL , and had a total of 854,267 excluding the playoffs . The Blackhawks reached the one million mark in Game 3 of the Western Conference Finals against the San Jose Sharks .
