Until 1956 all members of the ministry were members of the Cabinet . The growth of the ministry in the 1940s and 1950s made this increasingly impractical , and in 1956 Robert Menzies created a two - tier ministry , with only senior ministers holding Cabinet rank , also known within parliament as the front bench . This practice has been continued by all governments except the Whitlam Government .
