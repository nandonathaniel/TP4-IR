These people are mentioned in ancient Greek plays , and were commonly employed throughout Europe until the beginning of the nineteenth century . The practice continues in Africa . The 2003 award - winning Philippine comedy Crying Ladies revolves around the lives of three women who are part - time professional mourners for the Chinese - Filipino community in Manila 's Chinatown . According to the film , the Chinese use professional mourners to help expedite the entry of a deceased loved one 's soul into heaven by giving the impression that he or she was a good and loving person , well - loved by many .
