Britain refused to remove troops from Egypt or Malta , as agreed upon in the treaty . Bonaparte formally protested the continuing British occupations and , in January 1803 published a report by Horace Sebastiani that included observations on the ease with which France might capture Egypt , alarming most of the European powers . In an interview in February 1803 with Lord Whitworth , Britain 's French ambassador , Bonaparte threatened war if Malta was not evacuated and implied that he could have already retaken Egypt . The exchange left Whitworth feeling he was given an ultimatum . In a public meeting with a group of diplomats the following month , Bonaparte again pressed Whitworth , implying that the British wanted war since they were not upholding their treaty obligations . The Russian ambassador , Arkadiy Ivanovich Morkov , reported the encounter back to St. Petersburg in stark terms . The implicit and explicit threats contained in the exchange may have played a role in Russia 's eventual entry into the Third Coalition . Morkov also reported rumours that Bonaparte would seize Hamburg as well as Hanover if war was renewed . Although Alexander wanted to avoid war , that news apparently forced his hand ; he began collecting troops on the Baltic coast in late March . The Russian foreign minister wrote of the situation , `` The intention already expressed by the First Consul of striking blows against England wherever he can , and under this pretext of sending his troops into Hanover ( and ) Northern Germany ... entirely transforms the nature of this war as it relates to our interests and obligations .
