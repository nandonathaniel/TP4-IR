Thus Casablanca is not just one film . It is many films , an anthology . Made haphazardly , it probably made itself , if not actually against the will of its authors and actors , then at least beyond their control . And this is the reason it works , in spite of aesthetic theories and theories of film making . For in it there unfolds with almost telluric force the power of Narrative in its natural state , without Art intervening to discipline it ... When all the archetypes burst in shamelessly , we reach Homeric depths . Two clichés make us laugh . A hundred clichés move us . For we sense dimly that the clichés are talking among themselves , and celebrating a reunion .
