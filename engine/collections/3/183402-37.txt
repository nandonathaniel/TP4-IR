Due to the specific timing required for his souffl√© omelette , Soma struggles to get any customers to try his dish before they end up deflating . With half an hour left in the challenge , Soma calmly analyzes the situtation and changes his approach , cooking in front of his customers in order to attract a crowd while also delivering the dish in its peak condition . Optimizing his preparation time to cook his omelettes as quickly as possible , Soma manages to complete his 200 servings goal with merely seconds to spare . Afterwards , Soma is introduced to Erina 's cousin , Alice Nakiri , who considers both Soma and Erina her rivals . Following another task a few hours later , Dojima treats all the surviving students with a banquet to celebrate the end of the training camp , while withholding information about the next event : the Autumn Selection .
