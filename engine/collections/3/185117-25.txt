Constitutionalism : The modern political concept of constitutionalism establishes the law as supreme over the private will , by integrating nationalism , democracy , and limited government . The political legitimacy of constitutionalism derives from popular belief and acceptance that the actions of the government are legitimate because they abide by the law codified in the political constitution . The political scientist Carl Joachim Friedrich ( 1901 -- 84 ) said that , in dividing political power among the organs of government , constitutional law effectively restrains the actions of the government .
