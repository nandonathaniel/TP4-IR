A 4 - bolt main refers to the number of bolts attaching the main bearing caps to the block of an internal combustion engine . Four bolt mains are considered much stronger for high performance use than a 2 bolt main . Using 4 bolts to secure the main bearing caps reduces the amount of flex within the crankshaft as compared to 2 bolts .
