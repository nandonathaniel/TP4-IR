Ben first transformed into Ghostfreak to sneak out of his great aunt 's house in `` Permanent Retirement '' , admitting a sense of dread when he later uses Ghostfreak to defeat Zombozo . This would later be revealed to be the result of Zs'Skayr's consciousness influencing Ben whenever he becomes Ghostfreak . Eventually , Zs'Skayr becomes strong enough to escape the Omnitrix in the events of `` Ghostfreaked Out '' , causing Ben to lose the ability to become Ghostfreak until the events of `` Be Afraid of the Dark '' when Zs'Skayr escaped death by allowing himself to be scanned by the Omnitrix . Though the Ectonurite DNA was removed from the Codon Stream by Azmuth , Ben ends up using the Omnitrix to absorb Zs'Skayr during his attack on Vilgaxia . Since then , as shown in `` The Ultimate Sacrifice '' when Ben attempted to use Ghostfreak on Ultimate Humungosaur , the Zs'Skayr persona has stayed inactive . In `` Ben 10 : Ultimate Alien '' , Ghostfreak 's second skin looks notably different from the original series , having white skin , a bigger eye , and the Ultimatrix moved to his chest from his left chest . In `` Ben 10 : Omniverse '' he resembles his Original Series appearance , but now has chains on his neck , wrists , shoulders , and tail . There are chain links leading from the chains on his neck and tail to the Omnitrix on his chest . He is also much skinnier than he was before and does not seem to have the Zs'Skayr personality anymore .
