During `` I 'm Your Puppet '' , it was revealed that CeCe had a visitor pass to Radley signed by Wren and that she was secretly visiting Mona while she was admitted at the institution . According to Wren , he got into a lot of trouble for allowing her a pass at a time when Mona was n't supposed to have visitors . But he let CeCe see Mona because she was desperate to see her since she stated to have been `` traumatized by Alison '' and wanted to act as a mentor for Mona . Apparently , it was Melissa who called CeCe to tell her that Mona was in Radley . The reasons as to why she did so are still unspecified . Mona would later admit to seeing CeCe while in Radley , though not recalling what they spoke about due to being on medication , in the episode `` ' A ' is for A-l-i-v-e '' .
