Chinese architecture has been influential in varying degrees in the development of the architecture of many neighboring Asian countries . After the Tang dynasty , the era when much Chinese culture was imported en masse by neighboring nations , Chinese architecture has had a major influence on the architectural styles of Korea , Vietnam , and Japan , where the East Asian hip - and - gable roof design is ubiquitous . In Sri Lanka , Chinese architecture has played a significant role in shaping Sri Lankan architecture , alongside influences from Indian and Southeast Asian architecture . The Kandyan roof style , for example bears many similarities to the East Asian hip - and - gable roof technique which has its origins in China . In Thailand , certain Chinese techniques were adopted by Thai artisans after trade commenced with the Yuan and Ming dynasty . Certain temple and palace roof tops were also built in Chinese - style and Chinese - style buildings can be found in Ayutthaya a nod towards the large numbers of Chinese shipbuilders , sailors and traders who came to the country . In Indonesia , mosques bearing Chinese influence can be found in certain parts of the country . This influence is recent in comparison to other parts of Asia and is largely due to the sizable Chinese Indonesian community .
