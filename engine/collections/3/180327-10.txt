On the Moon , the spectral effects of space weathering are threefold : as the lunar surface matures it becomes darker ( the albedo is reduced ) , redder ( reflectance increases with increasing wavelength ) , and the depth of its diagnostic absorption bands are reduced These effects are largely due to the presence of nanophase iron in both the agglutinates and in the accreted rims on individual grains . The darkening effects of space weathering are readily seen by studying lunar craters . Young , fresh craters have bright ray systems , because they have exposed fresh , unweathered material , but over time those rays disappear as the weathering process darkens the material .
