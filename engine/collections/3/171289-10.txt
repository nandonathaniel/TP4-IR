In Mecca , at the pilgrimage season of 620 , Muhammad met six men of the Banu Khazraj from Medina , propounded to them the doctrines of Islam , and recited portions of the Quran . Impressed by this , the six embraced Islam , and at the Pilgrimage of 621 , five of them brought seven others with them . These twelve informed Muhammad of the beginning of gradual development of Islam in Medina , and took a formal pledge of allegiance at Muhammad 's hand , promising to accept him as a prophet , to worship none but one God , and to renounce certain sins such as theft , adultery , and murder . This is known as the `` First Pledge of al - Aqaba '' . At their request , Muhammad sent with them Mus'ab ibn ' Umair to teach them the instructions of Islam . Biographers have recorded the considerable success of Mus ` ab ibn ` Umair in preaching the message of Islam and bringing people under the umbrella of Islam in Medina .
