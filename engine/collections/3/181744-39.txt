A more long - running romantic pairing was featured between Mel and the character Steve Owen ( Martin Kemp ) , who was portrayed as a villain . It was an on / off romance beginning shortly after both characters ' introduction in 1998 . In an interview in June 2000 , Kemp discussed the relationship between Steve and Mel : `` Steve 's convinced Mel will make his life complete . She kept him going during all the bad times and now he 's determined to have her . It 's true of a lot of guys who get into trouble , they hang their hat on one idea and that keeps them sane ( ... ) there 's a driving force that kept them going while they were ( in prison ) . And often that 's a woman . You know from those tender moments when Mel came to visit Steve ( in prison ) that she was the thing that kept him going , and he wo n't stop til he gets her back . '' Eventually the couple were shown to marry in the soap in March 2001 , despite a revelation that Mel had strayed with Steve 's nemesis Phil Mitchell ( Steve McFadden ) . Tamzin Outhwaite explained , `` With Ian , Mel was the one who did n't want to go through with it . This time around Mel is the one who is apprehensive , hoping Steve will be there for her . If he is n't , she has no reason to stay in Walford . This really is make or break time for her . '' The wedding night was a precursor to one of the soap 's most publicised storylines , Who Shot Phil ? , where Phil was gunned down by an unknown assailant and , due to Mel 's infifelity , Steve became one of the prime suspects for the murder attempt , though he transpired to be a red herring . Discussing Mel and Steve 's wedding , Outhwaite said , `` Even though this wedding with Steve has got as much controversy as Mel 's last one ( with Ian ) , it feels more true . The characters seem more suited and it 's not a big , white wedding , it 's a low - key register office thing . '' 17 million viewers watched the wedding .
