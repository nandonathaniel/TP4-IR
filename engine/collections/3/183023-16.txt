Partly due to the drudgery of using the mechanical Monroe calculator , which was the best tool available to him while he was writing his doctoral thesis , Atanasoff began to search for faster methods of computation . At Iowa State , Atanasoff researched the use of slaved Monroe calculators and IBM tabulators for scientific problems . In 1936 he invented an analog calculator for analyzing surface geometry . The fine mechanical tolerance required for good accuracy pushed him to consider digital solutions .
