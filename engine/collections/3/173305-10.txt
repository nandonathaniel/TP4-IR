A myofibril ( also known as a muscle fibril ) is a basic rod - like unit of a muscle cell . Muscles are composed of tubular cells called myocytes , known as muscle fibers in striated muscle , and these cells in turn contain many chains of myofibrils . They are created during embryonic development in a process known as myogenesis .
