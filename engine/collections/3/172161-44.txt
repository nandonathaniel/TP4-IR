The Mint traces the origins of the 50 State Quarters program to a congressional hearing in June 1995 , at which Mint Director Philip N. Diehl , as well as prominent numismatists , urged Congress to pass legislation allowing a series of circulating commemorative coins similar to the quarters Canada had recently struck for its provinces . In response , Congress passed the United States Commemorative Coins Act of 1996 , which was signed by President Bill Clinton on October 20 , 1996 . The act directed the Mint to study whether a series of commemorative quarters would be successful . The Mint duly studied the matter , and reported favorably . Although the act had given Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin the authority to carry out the report by selecting new coin designs , Secretary Rubin preferred to await congressional action . The resulting 50 States Commemorative Coin Program Act was signed by President Clinton on December 1 , 1997 . Under the act , each of the fifty states would be honored with a new quarter , to be issued five a year beginning in 1999 , with the sequence of issuance determined by the order the states had entered the Union . The act allowed the Secretary to determine the position of the required legends , such as `` IN GOD WE TRUST '' on the coin : To accommodate a large design on the reverse , `` UNITED STATES OF AMERICA '' and `` QUARTER DOLLAR '' were moved to the obverse , and the bust of Washington shrunken slightly . A state 's design would be selected by the Treasury Secretary on the recommendation of the state 's governor .
