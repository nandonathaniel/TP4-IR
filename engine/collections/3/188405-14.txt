She was born in 1894 to Count Dracula and Martha , two vampires who zinged at first sight at Paradise . When Mavis was a baby , a mob of humans stormed their house and set it on fire . As Dracula tried to reason with the angry mob , a scream was heard and Martha was murdered . She left a book for her daughter to open until her one hundred and eighteenth birthday . As she grew up with her overprotective father , she was taught that the outside world was an evil place . Dracula taught her how to use her innate vampire abilities himself . Count Dracula then built Hotel Transylvania so he can keep her safe , and provide a place where monsters could vacation and be themselves , free from discrimination .
