Tracking experiments , which seek to gain information about the localisation and interaction of the desired protein . One way to do this is to replace the wild - type gene with a ' fusion ' gene , which is a juxtaposition of the wild - type gene with a reporting element such as green fluorescent protein ( GFP ) that will allow easy visualisation of the products of the genetic modification . While this is a useful technique , the manipulation can destroy the function of the gene , creating secondary effects and possibly calling into question the results of the experiment . More sophisticated techniques are now in development that can track protein products without mitigating their function , such as the addition of small sequences that will serve as binding motifs to monoclonal antibodies .
