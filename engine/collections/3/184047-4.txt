Hanger steak resembles flank steak in texture and flavor . It is a vaguely V - shaped pair of muscles with a long , inedible membrane running down the middle . The hanger steak is usually the most tender cut on an animal , and is best marinated and cooked quickly over high heat ( grilled or broiled ) and served rare or medium rare to avoid toughness .
