Fashion trends , in one sense , travelled `` full circle '' over the course of the Victorian era . The popular women 's styles during the Georgian era , and at the very beginning of Victoria 's reign , emphasised a simple style influenced by flowing gowns worn by women in Ancient Greece and Rome . The Empire waist silhouette was replaced by a trend towards ornate styles and an artificial silhouette , with the restrictiveness of women 's clothing reaching its low point during the mid-century passion for narrow corseted waists and hoop skirts . The iconic wide - brimmed women 's hats of the later Victorian era also followed the trend towards ostentatious display . Hats began the Victorian era as simple bonnets . By the 1880s , milliners were tested by the competition among women to top their outfits with the most creative ( and extravagant ) hats , designed with expensive materials such as silk flowers and exotic plumes such as ostrich and peacock . As the Victorian era drew to a close , however , fashions were showing indications of a popular backlash against excessive styles . Model , actress and socialite Lillie Langtry took London by storm in the 1870s , attracting notice for wearing simple black dresses to social events . Combined with her natural beauty , the style appeared dramatic . Fashions followed her example ( as well as Queen Victoria 's wearing of mourning black later in her reign ) . According to Harold Koda , the former Curator - in - chief of the Metropolitan Museum of Art 's Costume Institute ( 1 ) , `` The predominantly black palette of mourning dramatizes the evolution of period silhouettes and the increasing absorption of fashion ideals into this most codified of etiquettes , '' said Koda , `` The veiled widow could elicit sympathy as well as predatory male advances . As a woman of sexual experience without marital constraints , she was often imagined as a potential threat to the social order . ''
