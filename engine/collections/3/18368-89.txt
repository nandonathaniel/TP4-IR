Rank - based grading only measures performance relative to a given group , but not the real achievements of a given student . A student with moderate skills could be the best of a bad group , or the worst of a good group . For example , in a generally good class the pressure to assign grades along the curve would produce an artificial 7 % of F students , although all students actually performed quite well . This also works the other way round : in a class with generally bad performance , the students whose performances are not totally bad would be singled out to form an artificial group of A-students , although in another context they would never get these grades .
