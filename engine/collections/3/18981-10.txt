The Honda Civic is a line of small cars manufactured by Honda . Originally a subcompact , the Civic has gone through several generational changes , becoming both larger and more upmarket and moving into the compact car segment . EPA guidelines for vehicle size class stipulate a car having combined passenger and cargo room of 110 to 119.9 cubic feet ( 3,110 to 3,400 L ) is considered a mid-size car , and as such the tenth generation Civic sedan is technically a small - end mid-size car , although it still competes in the compact class . The Civic coupe is still considered a compact car . The Civic currently falls between the Honda Fit and Honda Accord .
