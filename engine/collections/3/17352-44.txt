Michael Gambon as Albus Dumbledore , the headmaster of Hogwarts and one of the greatest wizards of the age . Gambon assumed the role after Richard Harris , who played Dumbledore in the previous two films , died on 25 October 2002 , 3 weeks before the 2nd film 's release . Despite his illness , Harris was determined to film his part , telling a visiting David Heyman not to recast the role . Four months after Harris 's death , Cuar√≥n chose Gambon as his replacement . Gambon was unconcerned with bettering or copying Harris , instead giving his own interpretation , putting on a slight Irish accent for the role , as well as completing his scenes in three weeks . Rumours of Ian McKellen being offered the role started to spread , but when asked he rejected the rumours and stated he had played a similar character in Gandalf of The Lord of the Rings trilogy . He also stated it would have been inappropriate to take Harris 's role , as the late actor had called McKellen a `` dreadful '' actor . Harris 's family had expressed an interest in seeing Harris 's close friend Peter O'Toole being chosen as his replacement .
