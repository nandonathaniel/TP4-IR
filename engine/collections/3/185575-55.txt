`` I grew up reading Chekhov 's stories and plays . I have wanted to explore a Chekhov story for the stage for some time and I 'm delighted to bring Man in a Case to Berkeley Rep. Both tales are about solitary men and their self - imposed restrictions . We know very little about the character in the first story , ' Man in a Case , ' except that he teaches classical Greek and he 's kind of eccentric and conservative . But then something happens to him that is unexpected . The second story , ' About Love , ' provides an arresting contrast to the first work . At their core both stories are about love . And I think it 's a romantic show in many respects that is perfect for Berkeley Rep 's audience . ''
