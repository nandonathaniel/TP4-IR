Shortly after McLane 's arrival , which coincided with the maturation of Bagwell and Biggio , the Astros began to show signs of consistent success . After finishing second in their division in 1994 ( in a strike year ) , 1995 , and 1996 , the Astros won consecutive division titles in 1997 , 1998 , and 1999 . In the 1998 season , the Astros set a team record with 102 victories . However , each of these titles was followed by a first - round playoff elimination , in 1998 by the San Diego Padres and in 1997 and 1999 against the Atlanta Braves . The manager of these title teams was Larry Dierker , who had previously been a broadcaster and pitcher for the Astros . During this period , Bagwell , Biggio , Derek Bell , and Sean Berry earned the collective nickname `` The Killer Bs '' . In later seasons , the name came to include other Astros , especially Lance Berkman .
