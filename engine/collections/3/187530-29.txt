Thornton subsequently brings the boy 's body to the McDonald ranch and offers an explanation . The only McDonald daughter , Joey , impulsively rides off before Thornton can finish his story and ambushes him shortly thereafter . Her shot is not fatal , but the bullet lodges next to Thornton 's spine and in time begins to trouble him by occasionally pressing against the spinal cord , causing temporary paralysis of his right side . The local doctor , Dr. Miller , does not have the skill to remove the bullet and Thornton soon departs El Dorado for a new job .
