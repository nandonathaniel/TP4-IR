The outfield fences measure 8 feet 5 inches ( 2.57 m ) high from the left - field foul pole until the Yankees ' bullpen , when the fences begin to gradually descend in height until the right field foul pole , where they are only 8 feet ( 2.4 m ) tall . This also marks a decrease from the previous Yankee Stadium , where the outfield walls stood at a height of approximately 10 feet ( 3.0 m ) . The distance from home plate to the backstop is 52 feet 4 inches ( 15.95 m ) , a reduction of 20 feet ( 6.1 m ) from the previous facility . The field is made up of Kentucky bluegrass , the same surface as the previous stadium , which is grown on a 1,300 acres ( 530 ha ) farm in Bridgeton , New Jersey . The grass is equipped with a drainage system ( featuring over 14,000 feet ( 4,300 m ) of pipe ) that makes the field playable an hour after taking 2 inches ( 51 mm ) of rain .
