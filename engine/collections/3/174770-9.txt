During an interview with New Zealand radio station ZM , Galecki recalled his childhood relationship with his mother . As a child , he was well known for making up long stories and tales . In such situations , his mother used to make him play the `` quiet game '' , where he had to see how long he could go without talking . He also recalled that despite being a loving mother , she was also very tough . One phrase she would lovingly use was , `` I love you , now get out . ''
