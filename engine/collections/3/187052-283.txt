Media ownership is relatively complicated , with a number of cross shareholdings which have been rationalised in recent years , resulting in the movement of some ownership into the hands of black shareholders . This has been accompanied by a growth in black editorship and journalism . Johannesburg has a number of regional radio stations such as YFM , Metro FM , Phalaphala FM , Talk Radio 702 , Highveld Stereo now known as 947 , 5FM , UJ FM and Kaya FM and Classic FM . The number of radio stations has increased in recent years as the government has sold off frequencies to private companies . Johannesburg is also the headquarters of state - owned broadcaster South African Broadcasting Corporation and pay - broadcast network Multichoice which distributes M - Net and DStv a digital satellite service , while eTV also has a presence in the city . The city has two television towers , the Hillbrow Tower and the Sentech Tower .
