The government made no progress in investigating the cross-border trafficking of Mozambican , Malawian , and Zimbabwean children for agricultural labour . In January 2008 , however , the government signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the Zimbabwean government to conduct a joint project to regularize the status of illegal Zimbabwean migrant farm workers in South Africa 's Limpopo Province and ensure them proper employment conditions . The government did not undertake efforts to reduce domestic demand for commercial sex acts or to combat child sex tourism during the reporting period . All South African troops destined for peacekeeping missions abroad are provided training on sexual exploitation issues prior to their deployment .
