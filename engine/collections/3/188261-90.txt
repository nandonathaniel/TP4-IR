2007 saw fresh controversy about the NFL Network . That year , the network happened to hold the rights to some match - ups with major implications . The first came in late November when one - loss Dallas hosted one - loss Green Bay . Green Bay 's Brett Favre was also having one of the best seasons of his career and would eventually lead the resurgent Packers to the NFC Championship Game . Most fans could not see the game because of carriage restrictions , more noticeable because it involved nationally respected teams in a highly anticipated match - up . This controversy would pale in comparison to the final game the NFL Network would broadcast that season .
