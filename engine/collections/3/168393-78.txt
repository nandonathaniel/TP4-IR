A practical difference between dynamic and positive displacement pumps is how they operate under closed valve conditions . Positive displacement pumps physically displace fluid , so closing a valve downstream of a positive displacement pump produces a continual pressure build up that can cause mechanical failure of pipeline or pump . Dynamic pumps differ in that they can be safely operated under closed valve conditions ( for short periods of time ) .
