The Gazebo is where the characters meet to dance at the end of some episodes . It has a picture of all the characters including the Ball ( but except the Tittifers , one of the Trubliphones , the Tiddle and the Bed ) , the Tittifers ' Tree , a Daisy , the Tune Bridge , the Tombliboo Bush , the Tombliboo Instruments , Igglepiggle 's Blanket , the Tombliboo Bricks and , of course , the Gazebo , itself . It has two pictures of Makka Pakka , one with his Og - Pog , the other with him blowing his trumpet . The first dance was featured in the episode `` The Tombliboos ' Waving Game '' and it first gave a clue in `` Igglepiggle 's Blanket in Makka Pakka 's Ditch '' .
