According to Ethan Haimo , understanding of Schoenberg 's twelve - tone work has been difficult to achieve owing in part to the `` truly revolutionary nature '' of his new system , misinformation disseminated by some early writers about the system 's `` rules '' and `` exceptions '' that bear `` little relation to the most significant features of Schoenberg 's music '' , the composer 's secretiveness , and the widespread unavailability of his sketches and manuscripts until the late 1970s . During his life , he was `` subjected to a range of criticism and abuse that is shocking even in hindsight '' ( Haimo 1990 , 2 -- 3 ) .
