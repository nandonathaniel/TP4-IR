A subcutaneous injection is administered as a bolus into the subcutis , the layer of skin directly below the dermis and epidermis , collectively referred to as the cutis . Subcutaneous injections are highly effective in administering vaccines and medications such as insulin , morphine , diacetylmorphine and goserelin . Subcutaneous , as opposed to intravenous , injection of recreational drugs is referred to as `` skin popping '' . Subcutaneous administration may be abbreviated as SC , SQ , sub-cu , sub-Q , SubQ , or subcut . Subcut is the preferred abbreviation for patient safety .
