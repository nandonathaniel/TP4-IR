As Elijah was described as ascending into heaven in a fiery chariot , the Christian missionaries who converted Slavic tribes likely found him an ideal analogy for Perun , the supreme Slavic god of storms , thunder and lightning bolts . In many Slavic countries Elijah is known as Elijah the Thunderer ( Ilija Gromovnik ) , who drives the heavens in a chariot and administers rain and snow , thus actually taking the place of Perun in popular beliefs . Perun is also sometimes conflated with the legendary hero Elijah of Murom . The feast of St. Elias is known as Ilinden in South Slavic , and was chosen as the day of the Ilinden - Preobrazhenie Uprising in 1903 ; it is now the holiday of Republic Day in the Republic of Macedonia .
