On 19 June 2013 , Ben Bernanke announced a `` tapering '' of some of the Fed 's QE policies contingent upon continued positive economic data . Specifically , he said that the Fed could scale back its bond purchases from $85 billion to $65 billion a month during the upcoming September 2013 policy meeting . He also suggested that the bond - buying program could wrap up by mid-2014 . While Bernanke did not announce an interest rate hike , he suggested that if inflation followed a 2 % target rate and unemployment decreased to 6.5 % , the Fed would likely start raising rates . The stock markets dropped by approximately 4.3 % over the three trading days following Bernanke 's announcement , with the Dow Jones dropping 659 points between 19 and 24 June , closing at 14,660 at the end of the day on 24 June . On 18 September 2013 , the Fed decided to hold off on scaling back its bond - buying program , and announced in December 2013 that it would begin to taper its purchases in January 2014 . Purchases were halted on 29 October 2014 after accumulating $4.5 trillion in assets .
