In western Europe , social - democratic parties have been the dominant centre - left force since the dawn of modern European cooperation . The Socialist Group was one of the first Groups to be founded when it was created on 23 June 1953 in the European Parliament 's predecessor , the Common Assembly of the European Coal and Steel Community , and continued through the creation of the appointed Parliament in 1958 and the elected Parliament in 1979 . Meanwhile , the national parties making up the Group were also organising themselves on a European level outside the Parliament , with the parties creating the `` Confederation of Socialist Parties of the European Community '' in 1974 and its successor , the `` Party of European Socialists '' , in 1992 . As a result , the Group ( which had kept its `` Socialist Group '' name all along ) was renamed to the `` Group of the Party of European Socialists '' on 21 April 1993 and it became difficult to distinguish between the Party of European Socialists party and the parliamentary group . The Group reverted to ( approximately ) its former name of the `` Socialist Group in the European Parliament '' . on 20 July 2004 Despite all this , the Group was still universally referred to as `` PES '' , notwithstanding the 2009 name change to the `` Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats '' to accommodate the Democratic Party of Italy .
