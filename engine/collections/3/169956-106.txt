The continuing collapse of the Ottoman Empire led to two wars in the Balkans , in 1912 and 1913 , which in turn was a prelude to world war . By 1900 nation states had formed in Bulgaria , Greece , Montenegro and Serbia . Nevertheless , many of their ethnic compatriots lived under the control of the Ottoman Empire . In 1912 , these countries formed the Balkan League . There were three main causes of the First Balkan War . The Ottoman Empire was unable to reform itself , govern satisfactorily , or deal with the rising ethnic nationalism of its diverse peoples . Secondly , the Great Powers quarreled among themselves and failed to ensure that the Ottomans would carry out the needed reforms . This led the Balkan states to impose their own solution . Most important , the members of the Balkan League were confident that it could defeat the Turks . Their prediction was accurate , as Constantinople called for terms after six weeks of fighting .
