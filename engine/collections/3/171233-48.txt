In the aftermath of the War of 1812 , pro-imperial conservatives led by Anglican Bishop John Strachan took control in Ontario ( `` Upper Canada '' ) , and promoted the Anglican religion as opposed to the more republican Methodist and Baptist churches . A small interlocking elite , known as the Family Compact took full political control . Democracy , as practiced in the US , was ridiculed . The policies had the desired effect of deterring immigration from United States . Revolts in favor of democracy in Ontario and Quebec ( `` Lower Canada '' ) in 1837 were suppressed ; many of the leaders fled to the US . The American policy was to largely ignore the rebellions , and indeed ignore Canada generally in favor of westward expansion of the American Frontier .
