The Apocrypha of the King James Bible constitutes the books of the Vulgate that are present neither in the Hebrew Old Testament nor the Greek New Testament . Since these are derived from the Septuagint , from which the old Latin version was translated , it follows that the difference between the KJV and the Roman Catholic Old Testaments is traceable to the difference between the Palestinian and the Alexandrian canons of the Old Testament . This is only true with certain reservations , as the Latin Vulgate was revised by Jerome according to the Hebrew , and , where Hebrew originals were not found , according to the Septuagint . Furthermore , the Vulgate omits 3 and 4 Maccabees , which generally appear in the Septuagint , while the Septuagint and Luther 's Bible omit 2 Esdras , which is found in the Apocrypha of the Vulgate and the King James Bible . Luther 's Bible , moreover , also omits 1 Esdras . It should further be observed that the Clementine Vulgate places the Prayer of Manasses and 3 Esdras and 4 Esdras in an appendix after the New Testament as apocryphal .
