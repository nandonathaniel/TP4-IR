If the Earth were perfectly spherical and homogeneous , then the longitude at a point would be equal to the angle between a vertical north -- south plane through that point and the plane of the Greenwich meridian . Everywhere on Earth the vertical north -- south plane would contain the Earth 's axis . But the Earth is not homogeneous , and has mountains -- which have gravity and so can shift the vertical plane away from the Earth 's axis . The vertical north -- south plane still intersects the plane of the Greenwich meridian at some angle ; that angle is the astronomical longitude , calculated from star observations . The longitude shown on maps and GPS devices is the angle between the Greenwich plane and a not - quite - vertical plane through the point ; the not - quite - vertical plane is perpendicular to the surface of the spheroid chosen to approximate the Earth 's sea - level surface , rather than perpendicular to the sea - level surface itself .
