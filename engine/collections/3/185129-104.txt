' Tis the gift to be loved and that love to return , ' Tis the gift to be taught and a richer gift to learn , And when we expect of others what we try to live each day , Then we 'll all live together and we 'll all learn to say , ( refrain ) ' Tis the gift to have friends and a true friend to be , ' Tis the gift to think of others not to only think of `` me '' , And when we hear what others really think and really feel , Then we 'll all live together with a love that is real . ( refrain ) Tis the gift to be loving , tis the best gift of all Like a quiet rain it blesses where it falls And with it we will truly believe Tis better to give than it is to receive
