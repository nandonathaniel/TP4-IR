Road : the Helmstedt - Berlin autobahn ( A2 ) ( checkpoints Alpha and Bravo respectively ) . Soviet military personnel manned these checkpoints and processed Allied personnel for travel between the two points . Military personnel were required to be in uniform when traveling in this manner . Rail : Western Allied military personnel and civilian officials of the Allied forces were forbidden to use commercial train service between West Germany and West Berlin , because of GDR passport and customs controls when using them . Instead , the Allied forces operated a series of official ( duty ) trains that traveled between their respective duty stations in West Germany and West Berlin . When transiting the GDR , the trains would follow the route between Helmstedt and Griebnitzsee , just outside West Berlin . In addition to persons traveling on official business , authorized personnel could also use the duty trains for personal travel on a space - available basis . The trains traveled only at night , and as with transit by car , Soviet military personnel handled the processing of duty train travelers .
