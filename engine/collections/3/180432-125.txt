The origin of kinetic friction at nanoscale can be explained by thermodynamics . Upon sliding , new surface forms at the back of a sliding true contact , and existing surface disappears at the front of it . Since all surfaces involve the thermodynamic surface energy , work must be spent in creating the new surface , and energy is released as heat in removing the surface . Thus , a force is required to move the back of the contact , and frictional heat is released at the front .
