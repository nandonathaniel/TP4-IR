Primarily or exclusively aquatic animals have re-evolved from terrestrial tetrapods multiple times : examples include amphibians such as newts , reptiles such as crocodiles , sea turtles , ichthyosaurs , plesiosaurs and mosasaurs , marine mammals such as whales , seals and otters , and birds such as penguins . Many species of snakes are also aquatic and live their entire lives in the water . Among invertebrates , a number of insect species have adaptations for aquatic life and locomotion . Examples of aquatic insects include dragonfly larvae , water boatmen , and diving beetles . There are also aquatic spiders , although they tend to prefer other modes of locomotion under water than swimming proper .
