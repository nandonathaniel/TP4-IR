Jewel was discovered by Inga Vainshtein in August 1993 when John Hogan , lead singer from the local San Diego band Rust , whom Vainshtein was managing , called to tell her about a girl surfer who sang at a local coffee shop on Thursdays . Vainshtein drove to The Inner Change with a representative from Atlantic Records , and after the show they called Danny Goldberg , the head of Atlantic Record 's West Coast operations , and asked him to pay for Jewel 's demo , since at the time she was living in a van and lacked the means to record any of her own music . Vainshtein , who at the time was working as a film executive at Paramount , eventually became Jewel 's manager and was instrumental in creating a major bidding war that led to Jewel 's deal with Atlantic Records . She continued to manage Jewel until the end of the first album cycle . Jewel 's debut album Pieces of You was released in 1995 when she was only 21 . Recorded in a studio on singer Neil Young 's ranch , it included Young 's backing band , The Stray Gators , who played on his Harvest and Harvest Moon albums . Part of the album was recorded live at The Inner Change Cafe in San Diego , where she had risen to local fame . The album stayed on the Billboard 200 for two years , reaching number four at its peak . The album spawned the Top 10 hits `` You Were Meant for Me '' , `` Who Will Save Your Soul '' , and `` Foolish Games '' . The album eventually sold over 12 million copies in the United States alone .
