This record was previously held by X-Men : The Last Stand . Including Thursday night previews , as well , At World 's End earned $153,042,234 in 5 days , and is the fourth - highest - grossing film of 2007 . Among May 's Big Three ( Spider - Man 3 , Shrek 3 and Pirates 3 ) , Pirates 3 grossed the least both during its opening weekend and in total earnings . However , this was mainly attributed to the fact that it was released third , after the other two films , so there was already too much competition . It is also the second - highest - grossing film in the Pirates series .
