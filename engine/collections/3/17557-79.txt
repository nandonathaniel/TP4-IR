Most anthropologists hold that there are no known societies that are unambiguously matriarchal . According to J.M. Adovasio , Olga Soffer , and Jake Page , no true matriarchy is known actually to have existed . Anthropologist Joan Bamberger argued that the historical record contains no primary sources on any society in which women dominated . Anthropologist Donald Brown 's list of human cultural universals ( viz. , features shared by nearly all current human societies ) includes men being the `` dominant element '' in public political affairs , which he asserts is the contemporary opinion of mainstream anthropology . There are some disagreements and possible exceptions . A belief that women 's rule preceded men 's rule was , according to Haviland , `` held by many nineteenth - century intellectuals '' . The hypothesis survived into the 20th century and was notably advanced in the context of feminism and especially second - wave feminism , but the hypothesis is mostly discredited today , most experts saying that it was never true .
