Until recently , the aye - aye has been difficult to place within Strepsirrhini . Theories had been proposed that its family , Daubentoniidae , was either a lemuriform primate ( meaning its ancestors split from the lemur line more recently than lemurs and lorises split ) or a sister group to all the other strepsirrhines . In 2008 , the aye - aye family was confirmed to be most closely related to the other Malagasy lemurs , likely having descended from the same ancestral population that colonized the island .
