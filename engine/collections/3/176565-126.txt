After World War II , electrification was soon resumed in the newly nationalised British Railways ' Southern Region . The BR 1955 Modernisation Plan included the two - stage `` Kent Coast Electrification '' . The Chatham Main Line was completed , followed by the South Eastern Main Line and related lines . The voltage was raised from 660 V to 750 V. Since then , all electrification has used 750 V ; lines electrified before then remain at 660 V. Attention then switched to the neglected former L&SWR area ( then the South Western Division ) . The South Western Main Line ( SWML ) to Southampton Central and Bournemouth was electrified in 1967 and to Weymouth in 1988 .
