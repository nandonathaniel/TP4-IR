In his native Paris , Voltaire was viewed as the defender of Jean Calas and Pierre Sirven . Although he failed in securing the annulment of la Barre 's execution for `` blasphemies '' against Christianity , despite a protracted campaign , the criminal code that sanctioned the execution was revised during Voltaire 's lifetime . In 1764 , Voltaire successfully intervened and secured the release of Claude Chamont for the crime of attending Protestant services . When Comte de Lally was executed for treason in 1766 , Voltaire wrote a 300 - page document absolving de Lally . Subsequently , in 1778 , the judgment against de Lally was expunged just before Voltaire 's death . The Genevan Protestant minister Pomaret once said to Voltaire , `` You seem to attack Christianity , and yet you do the work of a Christian . '' Frederick the Great noted the significance of a philosopher capable of influencing judges to change their unjust decisions , commenting that this alone is sufficient to ensure the prominence of Voltaire as a humanitarian .
