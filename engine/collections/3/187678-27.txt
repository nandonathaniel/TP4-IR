In a linear hierarchy , the maximum degree is 1 . In other words , all of the objects can be visualized in a lineup , and each object ( excluding the top and bottom ones ) has exactly one direct subordinate and one direct superior . Note that this is referring to the objects and not the levels ; every hierarchy has this property with respect to levels , but normally each level can have an infinite number of objects . An example of a linear hierarchy is the hierarchy of life .
