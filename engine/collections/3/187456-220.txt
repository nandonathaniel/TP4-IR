On 15 May 1995 , at ASCAP 's twelfth annual Pop Music Awards in Beverly Hills , California , `` Without You '' was recognised as one of the 50 most - played songs of 1994 ( due largely to Mariah Carey 's recording ) . Discrepancies in ASCAP 's books , resulting from a lawsuit against the Ham and Evans estates by their former manager , incorrectly attributed the song as being composed not only by Ham and Evans , but also by Badfinger 's other bandmembers , Mike Gibbins and Joey Molland , and their former manager , Bill Collins . This designation and a lack of correction by ASCAP prompted the Ham Estate to boycott the ceremony . The song was also nominated for `` Song of the Year '' in London at the Ivor Novello Awards .
