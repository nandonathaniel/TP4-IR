In this circumstance , it may be expected that there may also be active other drivers of diffusive flux of internal energy , such as gradient of chemical potential which drives transfer of matter , and gradient of electric potential which drives electric current and iontophoresis ; such effects usually interact with diffusive flux of internal energy driven by temperature gradient , and such interactions are known as cross-effects .
