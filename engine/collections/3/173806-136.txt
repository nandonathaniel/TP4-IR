The company 's headquarters in London , from which much of India was governed , was East India House in Leadenhall Street . After occupying premises in Philpot Lane from 1600 to 1621 ; in Crosby House , Bishopsgate , from 1621 to 1638 ; and in Leadenhall Street from 1638 to 1648 , the company moved into Craven House , an Elizabethan mansion in Leadenhall Street . The building had become known as East India House by 1661 . It was completely rebuilt and enlarged in 1726 -- 9 ; and further significantly remodelled and expanded in 1796 -- 1800 . It was finally vacated in 1860 and demolished in 1861 -- 62 . The site is now occupied by the Lloyd 's building .
