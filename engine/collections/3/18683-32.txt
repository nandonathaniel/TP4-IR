The left bundle branch is short , splitting into the left anterior fascicle and the left posterior fascicle . The left posterior fascicle is relatively short and broad , with dual blood supply , making it particularly resistant to ischemic damage . The left posterior fascicle transmits impulses to the papillary muscles , leading to mitral valve closure . As the left posterior fascicle is shorter and broader than the right , impulses reach the papillary muscles just prior to depolarization , and therefore contraction , of the left ventricle myocardium . This allows pre-tensioning of the chordae tendinae , increasing the resistance to flow through the mitral valve during left ventricular contraction . This mechanism works in the same manner as pre-tensioning of car seatbelts .
