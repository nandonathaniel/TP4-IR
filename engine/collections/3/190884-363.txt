In early March 2016 , a report by Stuff magazine revealed that test performed by VICOM , Ltd on behalf of Singapore 's Land Transport Authority had found a 2014 Tesla Model S to be consuming 444 Wh / km ( 0.715 kW ⋅ h / mi ) , which was greater than the 240 Wh / km ( 0.38 kW ⋅ h / mi ) reported by the U.S Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) and the 181 Wh / km ( 0.291 kW ⋅ h / mi ) reported by Tesla . As a result , a carbon surcharge was imposed on the Model S , making Singapore the only country in the world to impose an environmental surcharge on a fully electric car . The Land Transport Authority justified this by stating that it had to `` account for CO emissions during the electricity generation process '' and therefore `` a grid emission factor of 0.5 g / watt - hour was also applied to the electric energy consumption '' , however Tesla countered that when the energy used to extract , refine , and distribute gasoline was taken into account , the Model S produces approximately one - third the CO of an equivalent gasoline - powered vehicle .
