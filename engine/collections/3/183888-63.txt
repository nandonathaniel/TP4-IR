Elementary mathematics in most countries is taught in a similar fashion , though there are differences . In the United States fractions are typically taught starting from 1st grade , whereas in other countries they are usually taught later , since the metric system does not require young children to be familiar with them . Most countries tend to cover fewer topics in greater depth than in the United States . K - 12 topics include elementary arithmetic ( addition , subtraction , multiplication , and division ) , and pre-algebra .
