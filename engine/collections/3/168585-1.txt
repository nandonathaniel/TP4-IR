As one can see in the table below , there has been much volatility in the states ' drinking ages since the repeal of Prohibition in 1933 . Shortly after the ratification of the 21st amendment in December , most states set their purchase ages at 21 since that was the Voting age at the time . Most of these limits remained constant until the early 1970s . From 1969 to 1976 , some 30 states lowered their purchase ages , generally to 18 . This was primarily because the voting age was lowered from 21 to 18 in 1971 with the 26th amendment . A lot of states started to lower their minimum drinking age in response , most of this occurring in 1972 or 1973 . Twelve states kept their purchase ages at 21 since repeal of Prohibition and never changed them .
