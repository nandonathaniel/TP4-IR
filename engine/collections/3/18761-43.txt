Millennials are expected to make up approximately half of the U.S. workforce by 2020 . Millennials are the most highly educated and culturally diverse group of all generations , and have been regarded as hard to please when it comes to employers . To address these new challenges , many large firms are currently studying the social and behavioral patterns of Millennials and are trying to devise programs that decrease intergenerational estrangement , and increase relationships of reciprocal understanding between older employees and Millennials . The UK 's Institute of Leadership & Management researched the gap in understanding between Millennial recruits and their managers in collaboration with Ashridge Business School . The findings included high expectations for advancement , salary and for a coaching relationship with their manager , and suggested that organizations will need to adapt to accommodate and make the best use of Millennials . In an example of a company trying to do just this , Goldman Sachs conducted training programs that used actors to portray Millennials who assertively sought more feedback , responsibility , and involvement in decision making . After the performance , employees discussed and debated the generational differences they saw played out .
