In 1747 , the Scottish surgeon James Lind discovered that citrus foods helped prevent scurvy , a particularly deadly disease in which collagen is not properly formed , causing poor wound healing , bleeding of the gums , severe pain , and death . In 1753 , Lind published his Treatise on the Scurvy , which recommended using lemons and limes to avoid scurvy , which was adopted by the British Royal Navy . This led to the nickname limey for British sailors . Lind 's discovery , however , was not widely accepted by individuals in the Royal Navy 's Arctic expeditions in the 19th century , where it was widely believed that scurvy could be prevented by practicing good hygiene , regular exercise , and maintaining the morale of the crew while on board , rather than by a diet of fresh food . As a result , Arctic expeditions continued to be plagued by scurvy and other deficiency diseases . In the early 20th century , when Robert Falcon Scott made his two expeditions to the Antarctic , the prevailing medical theory at the time was that scurvy was caused by `` tainted '' canned food .
