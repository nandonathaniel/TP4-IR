The original outline of the story featured the Queen 's attempt to kill Snow White with a poisoned comb , an element taken from the Grimms ' version of the tale ( the Dwarfs would arrive in time to remove it ) . The envious Queen would also decide to take possession of Snow White 's attractive young suitor , the 18 - year - old Prince ( described in a press kit as `` every woman 's dream man '' ) for herself , offering him an opportunity to share the throne with her through a marriage . With the Prince refusing to marry her , the Queen would have him captured by her guards and taken to her dungeon to be suspended in chains in a torture chamber . She would later visit him there and used her sorcery to taunt him by bringing the dungeon 's skeletons ( also chained to the walls ) to life and making them dance , identifying one skeleton as `` Prince Oswald '' , only for the Prince to defy her again . She then has him given to the torturers , described as `` the Nubians '' , and `` exits with a dirty laugh . ''
