Coal mining is the industry most frequently associated with the region in outsiders ' minds , due in part to the fact that the region once produced two - thirds of the nation 's coal . At present , however , the mining industry employs just 2 % of the Appalachian workforce . The region 's vast coalfield covers 63,000 square miles ( 160,000 km ) between northern Pennsylvania and central Alabama , mostly along the Cumberland Plateau and Allegheny Plateau regions . Most mining activity has been concentrated in eastern Kentucky , southwestern Virginia , West Virginia , and western Pennsylvania , with smaller operations in western Maryland , Tennessee and Alabama . The Pittsburgh coal seam , which has produced 13 billion tons of coal since the early 19th century , has been called the world 's most valuable mineral deposit . There are over 60 major coal seams in West Virginia , and over 80 in eastern Kentucky . Most of the coal mined is bituminous , although significant anthracite deposits exist on the fringe of the region in central Pennsylvania . About two - thirds of Appalachia 's coal is produced by underground mining , the rest by surface mining . Mountaintop removal , a form of surface mining , is a highly controversial mining practice in central Appalachia due to its negative impacts on the environment and health of local residents .
