Merton 's work on the `` role model '' first appeared in a study on the socialization of medical students at Columbia University . The term grew from his theory of the reference group , the group to which individuals compare themselves but to which they do not necessarily belong . Social roles were central to Merton 's theory of social groups . Merton emphasized that , rather than a person assuming one role and one status , they have a status set in the social structure that has , attached to it , a whole set of expected behaviors .
