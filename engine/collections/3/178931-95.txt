This episode replays the event where Sora asks Haru to take her measurements so she can have a uniform made . The next day Nao comes over to bring Haruka some mosquito repellent , since Sora is scared of mosquitoes , and then leaves almost immediately . The next day Ryouhei invites Haruka to the school rooftop to take a peek at the girls cleaning the pool . Haruka warns Ryouhei , though , not to peek at Nao , and leaves . Much later Ryouhei tells Nao that Haruka , `` the prince she has been waiting for , '' has a crush on her ; but she thinks he does not like her . The truth is that something happened between the two many summers ago : Nao , trying to escape the noise of her arguing parents , ran to Haruka 's house . At that time Haruka was sleeping at their veranda , and was surprised to see Nao on top of him with her clothes undone . Until now Nao feels guilty for what she did . However , Ryouhei , even Akira and Kazuha , is into the act of bringing Haruka and Nao together . They did so by making the two meet at school pool on a Sunday . When they were changing after the swimming lesson , Haruka rushes into the girls ' locker room when Nao was scared by a black cat inside a box . The school supervisor hears their chatter , but the two were able to hide inside a box before he catches them . Thinking it was just the cat , he leaves . There , Nao gets to know that Haruka does not hate her , only that he was just surprised at the events of that summer day , dispelling her assumptions . Meanwhile , Sora shows her hatred of Nao , whom she thinks is the reason why Haruka has been preoccupied the past couple of days , at home on her laptop .
