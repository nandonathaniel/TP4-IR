Donnie Baker ( played by Ron Sexton ) -- regularly makes topical calls to the show and has a very authentic redneck accent . He relates anecdotes involving a good friend who had a semi-relevant experience , usually ending in a punch - line . Most of his calls are punctuated by a tagline like , `` I swear to God '' or `` Look it up ... '' or `` it 's state law . '' Sometimes , Donnie is corrected , or told to get off the phone by Randy , his work supervisor ( voiced by Matt Thompson ) , after which he always yells , `` Shut up Randy ! '' His calls usually come to an abrupt end , and always by him saying , `` ... I got ta go . '' Donnie also appears with his band as `` Donnie Baker and the Pork Pistols '' .
