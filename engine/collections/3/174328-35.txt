Shakespeare roles during this period included Prospero in Shakespeare 's The Tempest , on Broadway in 1995 , a role he would reprise in Rupert Goold 's 2006 production of The Tempest as part of the Royal Shakespeare Company 's Complete Works Festival . In 1997 , he took the role of Othello with the Shakespeare Theatre Company ( Washington , D.C. ) in a race - bending performance , in a `` photo negative '' production of a white Othello with an otherwise all - black cast . Stewart had wanted to play the title role since the age of 14 , so he and director Jude Kelly inverted the play so Othello became a comment on a white man entering a black society .
