Very few non-Indian actors are able to make a mark in Bollywood , though many have tried from time to time . There have been some exceptions , of which one recent example is the hit film Rang De Basanti , where the lead actress is Alice Patten , an Englishwoman . Kisna , Lagaan , and The Rising : Ballad of Mangal Pandey also featured foreign actors . Of late , Emma Brown Garett , an Australian born actress , has starred in a few Indian films .
