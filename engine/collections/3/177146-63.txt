Article 44 encourages the State to secure a uniform civil code for all citizens , by eliminating discrepancies between various personal laws currently in force in the country . However , this has remained a `` dead letter '' despite numerous reminders from the Supreme Court to implement the provision . Article 45 originally mandated the State to provide free and compulsory education to children between the ages of six and fourteen years , but after the 86th Amendment in 2002 , this has been converted into a Fundamental Right and replaced by an obligation upon the State to secure childhood care to all children below the age of six . Article 47 commits the State to raise the standard of living and improve public health , and prohibit the consumption of intoxicating drinks and drugs injurious to health . As a consequence , partial or total prohibition has been introduced in several states , but financial constraints have prevented its full - fledged application . The State is also mandated by Article 48 to organise agriculture and animal husbandry on modern and scientific lines by improving breeds and prohibiting slaughter of cattle . Article 48A mandates the State to protect the environment and safeguard the forests and wildlife of the country , while Article 49 places an obligation upon the State to ensure the preservation of monuments and objects of national importance . Article 50 requires the State to ensure the separation of judiciary from executive in public services , in order to ensure judicial independence , and federal legislation has been enacted to achieve this objective . The State , according to Article 51 , must also strive for the promotion of international peace and security , and Parliament has been empowered under Article 253 to make laws giving effect to international treaties .
