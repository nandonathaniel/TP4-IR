The Red River rises near the edge of the northwestern dip slope of the Llano Estacado mesa in two forks in northern Texas and southwestern Oklahoma . The North Fork Red River meets the southern and largest fork near the Texas -- Oklahoma border . The southern fork , which is about 120 miles ( 190 km ) long , is generally called the Prairie Dog Town Fork . It is formed in Randall County , Texas , near the county seat of Canyon , by the confluence of intermittent Palo Duro Creek and Tierra Blanca Creek .
