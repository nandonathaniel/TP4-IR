Dwight Schrute ( Rainn Wilson ) has largely removed himself to the online virtual world of Second Life . Dwight has created an avatar named Dwight Shelford , also a paper salesman , patterned after his once - perfect real life . He now uses Second Life as an escape from his real - life troubles , even going as far as creating a virtual Second Life , called Second Second Life . Jim Halpert ( John Krasinski ) , on the other hand , has created an avatar named Jim Samtanko , a guitar - playing Philadelphia sportswriter , and enters Second Life in order to spy on Dwight .
