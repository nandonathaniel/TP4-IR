In sport In Gaelic games , no distinction is recognised between the GAA counties of the Republic and those of Northern Ireland . County teams play in their provincial championships ( where the six counties of Ulster within Northern Ireland and three within the Republic all play in the Ulster championship ) and the winners of these play in the All - Ireland championship . Even within Northern Ireland , a tricolour , the flag of the Republic of Ireland , is flown at all games . At bigger games , where an anthem is played , it is always the national anthem of the Republic . In the case of the International Rules series against Australia , an Irish national team is chosen from all 32 counties . In Association Football , the teams correspond to political entities : Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland . In accordance with UEFA and FIFA 's rules , each of these countries has its own football league : the Irish League and the League of Ireland respectively . In rugby union , rugby league , field hockey , cricket , boxing , golf , athletics and others the Ireland team is drawn from the whole island ( i.e. both the Republic and Northern Ireland ) . Many sports organisations are subdivided along provincial lines e.g. Gaelic Athletic Association , golf .
