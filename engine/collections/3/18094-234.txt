Some municipalities have preserved sections as town or county canal parks , or have plans to do so . Camillus Erie Canal Park preserves a 7 - mile ( 11 km ) stretch and has restored Nine Mile Creek Aqueduct , built in 1841 as part of the First Enlargement of the canal . In some communities , the old canal has refilled with overgrowth and debris . Proposals have been made to rehydrate the old canal through downtown Rochester or Syracuse as a tourist attraction . In Syracuse , the location of the old canal is represented by a reflecting pool in downtown 's Clinton Square and the downtown hosts a canal barge and weigh lock structure , now dry . Buffalo 's Commercial Slip is the restored and re-watered segment of the canal which formed its `` Western Terminus '' .
