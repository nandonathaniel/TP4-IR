Get away ( garbled ) for what ? Every time you see me , you want to mess with me . I 'm tired of it . It stops today . Why would you ... ? Everyone standing here will tell you I did n't do nothing . I did not sell nothing . Because every time you see me , you want to harass me . You want to stop me ( garbled ) selling cigarettes . I 'm minding my business , officer , I 'm minding my business . Please just leave me alone . I told you the last time , please just leave me alone .
