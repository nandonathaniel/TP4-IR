There is a lack of oversight . Teachers are told to watch over the students and be as organized as possible when collecting and grading the tests , but there are numerous sources stating all of these instances where students , even teachers are cheating . Students have been known to somehow accommodate the answers , or during breaks , teachers are not told to watch over the conversations held ; they could easily discuss questions and figure out the answers together . Teachers , more of which are in `` desperate situations '' find that they are changing the answers for their students themselves to make it look like they are great teachers and it would take away from the pressure they feel in raising scores . `` The accountability system is whats driving ( standardized testing ) and it 's fundamentally flawed .
