The Nordic House in the Faroe Islands ( Faroese : Norðurlandahúsið ) is the most important cultural institution in the Faroes . Its aim is to support and promote Scandinavian and Faroese culture , locally and in the Nordic region . Erlendur Patursson ( 1913 -- 86 ) , Faroese member of the Nordic Council , raised the idea of a Nordic cultural house in the Faroe Islands . A Nordic competition for architects was held in 1977 , in which 158 architects participated . Winners were Ola Steen from Norway and Kolbrún Ragnarsdóttir from Iceland . By staying true to folklore , the architects built the Nordic House to resemble an enchanted hill of elves . The house opened in Tórshavn in 1983 . The Nordic House is a cultural organization under the Nordic Council . The Nordic House is run by a steering committee of eight , of whom three are Faroese and five from other Nordic countries . There is also a local advisory body of fifteen members , representing Faroese cultural organizations . The House is managed by a director appointed by the steering committee for a four - year term .
