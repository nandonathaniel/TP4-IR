The Spanish Bourbons monarchs ' prime innovation introduction of intendancies , an institution emulating that of Bourbon France . They were first introduced on a large scale in New Spain , by the Minister of the Indies José de Gálvez , in the 1770s , who originally envisioned that they would replace the viceregal system ( viceroyalty ) altogether . With broad powers over tax collection and the public treasury and with a mandate to help foster economic growth over their districts , intendants encroached on the traditional powers of viceroys , governors and local officials , such as the corregidores , which were phased out as intendancies were established . The Crown saw the intendants as a check on these other officers . Over time accommodations were made . For example , after a period of experimentation in which an independent intendant was assigned to Mexico City , the office was thereafter given to the same person who simultaneously held the post of viceroy . Nevertheless , the creation of scores of autonomous intendancies throughout the Viceroyalty , created a great deal of decentralization , and in the Captaincy General of Guatemala , in particular , the intendancy laid the groundwork for the future independent nations of the 19th century . In 1780 , Minister of the Indies José de Gálvez sent a royal dispatch to Teodoro de Croix , Commandant General of the Internal Provinces of New Spain ( Provincias Internas ) , asking all subjects to donate money to help the American Revolution . Millions of pesos were given .
