Beginning as early as the 14th century , a grocer ( or `` purveyor '' ) was a dealer in comestible dry goods such as spices , peppers , sugar , and ( later ) cocoa , tea , and coffee . Because these items were often bought in bulk , they were named after the french word for wholesaler , or `` grossier '' . This , in turn , is derived from the Medieval Latin term `` grossarius '' , from which the term `` gross '' ( meaning a quantity of 12 dozen , or 144 ) is also derived .
