June 30 , 1921 The `` Wedge '' dispute between Delaware and Pennsylvania was resolved in Delaware 's favor . The disputed land had generally been administered by Delaware , even electing a member of the Delaware legislature in the mid-19th century , but federal maps had included the land as part of Pennsylvania at least as late as 1900 . The states had agreed on a resolution , and it was affirmed by an act of Congress on this date . Some sources , contemporary and modern , note that , in the original process of resurveying the border in 1892 , a very thin , horn - shaped region along the arc was transferred from Delaware to Pennsylvania ; however , no federal maps found reflect this , and it is unclear if this transfer actually occurred .
