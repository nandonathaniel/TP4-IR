The East -- West Schism , also called the Great Schism and the Schism of 1054 , was the break of communion between what are now the Catholic Church and Eastern Orthodox churches , which has lasted since the 11th century . The Schism was the culmination of theological and political differences between the Christian East and West which had developed over the preceding centuries , and marked the first time since the Edict of Milan that there was more than one body considered by secular authorities to constitute the Christian Church .
