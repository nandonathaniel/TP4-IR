India has a high rate of migration from rural areas to urban cities . A major reason for the massive migration to cities was the Partition of India . More than half of the refugees from Pakistan settled in urban areas such as Delhi . It is estimated that up to 590 million people , or 40 % of the Indian population will be living in cities by 2030 , much higher than the current 28 % . Also , it is estimated that six states , including West Bengal , Tamil Nadu , Gujarat , Maharashtra , Karnataka , Kerala , Telangana and Punjab will have more than half of their total population living in Urban areas by 2030 .
