Resurgence : Returning oneself or others from the dead to full life . It is powerful enough to heal the skin of burnt corpses and even fuse limbs not previously attached to the body . The power is useless if the body is in too many pieces . Not to be confused with the Resurrection Spell which can be done by any witch that performs the ritual and incantation , often with undesirable results in accordance with the witches power and adherence to the spell . Nor is it the same as the Voodoo power of Necromancy which creates mindless zombies .
