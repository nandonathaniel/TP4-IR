In 2013 , it was reported that 64 people have been convicted of defrauding ACC of a total of more than $10 million over the past four years . This includes clients claiming they were `` injured '' but who kept working while receiving ACC benefits and medical practitioners who billed ACC for more treatment than they actually provided . Another category of ACC fraudster includes widows who continued claiming payments after their ( injured ) partners have subsequently died . Sometimes these payments went on for nearly 30 years before the fraud came to light -- with one woman receiving nearly $150,000 after her husband had died .
