More generally , El Niño can affect commodity prices and the macroeconomy of different countries . It can constrain the supply of rain - driven agricultural commodities ; reduce agricultural output , construction , and services activities ; create food - price and generalised inflation ; and may trigger social unrest in commodity - dependent poor countries that primarily rely on imported food . A University of Cambridge Working Paper shows that while Australia , Chile , Indonesia , India , Japan , New Zealand and South Africa face a short - lived fall in economic activity in response to an El Niño shock , other countries may actually benefit from an El Niño weather shock ( either directly or indirectly through positive spillovers from major trading partners ) , for instance , Argentina , Canada , Mexico and the United States . Furthermore , most countries experience short - run inflationary pressures following an El Niño shock , while global energy and non-fuel commodity prices increase . The IMF estimates a significant El Niño can boost the GDP of the United States by about 0.5 % ( due largely to lower heating bills ) and reduce the GDP of Indonesia by about 1.0 % .
