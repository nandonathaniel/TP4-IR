`` The Sopranos 's brilliant solution is to situate most of its nudity in the Bada Bing ! strip joint run by Tony Soprano 's aide - de-camp , Silvio Dante . The setting is an eminently logical place to frequently find Tony and his crew discussing business , and the naked women need no further motivation than that they are dancing in the club ... Bada Bing ! is an ideal locale -- doing for The Sopranos what the diner did for Seinfeld , and the bar owned by Munch , Meldrake , and Bayliss did for Homicide -- but with a physically illicit explicitness that gives sexual energy to whatever other story is unfolding .
