On the Union side , President Abraham Lincoln had become frustrated with Buell 's passivity and replaced him with Maj. Gen. William S. Rosecrans , victor of the recent battles of Iuka and Corinth . Rosecrans moved his XIV Corps ( which was soon after designated the Army of the Cumberland ) to Nashville , Tennessee , and was warned by Washington that he too would be replaced if he did not move aggressively against Bragg and occupy eastern Tennessee . However , Rosecrans took ample time to reorganize and train his forces ( particularly his cavalry ) and resupply his army . He did not begin his march in pursuit of Bragg until December 26 .
