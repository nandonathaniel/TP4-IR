Uthman gave permission to Muawiyah to build a navy . From their base in Syria , the Muslims used this fleet to capture Cyprus in 649 and Crete and then Rhodes and the launching of annual raids into Western Anatolia thwarted the Byzantines from making any further attempts to recapture Syria . In 654 -- 655 , Uthman ordered the preparation of an expedition to capture the capital of the Eastern Roman empire , Constantinople , but due to unrest in the empire that grew in 655 and resulted in his assassination , the expedition was delayed for decades only to be attempted unsuccessfully under the next dynasty of Ummayad rulers .
