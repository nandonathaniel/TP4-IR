Iran 's abrogation of the treaty marked the beginning of a period of acute Iraqi - Iranian tension that was to last until the 1975 Algiers Agreement . In 1969 , Saddam Hussein , Iraq 's deputy prime minister , stated : `` Iraq 's dispute with Iran is in connection with Khuzestan , which is part of Iraq 's soil and was annexed to Iran during foreign rule . '' Soon , Iraqi radio stations began exclusively broadcasting into `` Arabistan '' , encouraging Arabs living in Iran and even Baloch people to revolt against the Shah 's government . Basra TV stations began showing Iran 's Khuzestan province as part of Iraq 's new province of `` Nāṣiriyyah '' ( ناصرية ) , renaming all of its cities with Arabic names .
