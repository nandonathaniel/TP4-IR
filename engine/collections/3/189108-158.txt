Shanty choirs ( German Shantychor , Dutch shantykoor ) , often large choral groups that perform only sailor songs , are especially popular in the Netherlands , Germany , and Norway . Polish performers of shanties favor medium - sized groups , often singing in harmony , accompanying themselves on instruments , and presenting themselves similarly to the way a rock band would .
