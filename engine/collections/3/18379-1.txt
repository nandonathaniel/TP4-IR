Tide tables can be used to find the predicted times and amplitude ( or `` tidal range '' ) of tides at any given locale . The predictions are influenced by many factors including the alignment of the Sun and Moon , the phase and amplitude of the tide ( pattern of tides in the deep ocean ) , the amphidromic systems of the oceans , and the shape of the coastline and near - shore bathymetry ( see Timing ) . They are however only predictions , the actual time and height of the tide is affected by wind and atmospheric pressure . Some shorelines experience a semi-diurnal tide -- two nearly equal high and low tides each day . Other locations experience a diurnal tide -- only one high and low tide each day . A `` mixed tide '' -- two uneven tides a day , or one high and one low -- is also possible .
