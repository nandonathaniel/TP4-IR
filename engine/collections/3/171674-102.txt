The Suez Canal , initially built by the French , became a joint British - French project in 1875 , as both saw it as vital to maintaining their influence and empires in Asia . In 1882 , ongoing civil disturbances in Egypt ( see Urabi Revolt ) prompted Britain to intervene , extending a hand to France . France 's expansionist Prime Minister Jules Ferry was out of office , and the government was unwilling to send more than an intimidating fleet to the region . Britain established a protectorate , as France had a year earlier in Tunisia , and popular opinion in France later put this action down to duplicity . It was about this time that the two nations established co-ownership of Vanuatu . The Anglo - French Convention of 1882 was also signed to resolve territory disagreements in western Africa .
