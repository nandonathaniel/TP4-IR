Further criticism has been leveled by Brody ( 2004 ) , who claimed that unlike tests of cognitive ability , the MSCEIT `` tests knowledge of emotions but not necessarily the ability to perform tasks that are related to the knowledge that is assessed '' . The main argument is that even though someone knows how he or she should behave in an emotionally laden situation , it does n't necessarily follow that the person could actually carry out the reported behavior .
