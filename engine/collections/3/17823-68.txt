Before making The Shining , Stanley Kubrick had directed the 1975 film Barry Lyndon , a highly visual period film about an Irish man who attempts to make his way into the British aristocracy . Despite its technical achievements , the film was not a box office success in the United States and was derided by critics for being too long and too slow . Kubrick , disappointed with Barry Lyndon 's lack of success , realized he needed to make a film that would be commercially viable as well as artistically fulfilling . Stephen King was told that Kubrick had his staff bring him stacks of horror books as he planted himself in his office to read them all : `` Kubrick 's secretary heard the sound of each book hitting the wall as the director flung it into a reject pile after reading the first few pages . Finally one day the secretary noticed it had been a while since she had heard the thud of another writer 's work biting the dust . She walked in to check on her boss and found Kubrick deeply engrossed in reading The Shining . ''
