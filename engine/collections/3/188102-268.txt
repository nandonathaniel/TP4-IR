There 's a sentence there and a reference I added there to say retail availability vary by state . I have n't itemized them since that reference I added does not look totally credible . The ones that I have authoritative statute for are listed . I have n't found one on Michigan yet . Iowa was in the list , but it was based on a speculative ban from the media in 2010 and statute confirming the ban was not found . Cantaloupe2 ( talk ) 00 : 00 , 17 July 2013 ( UTC )
