Played by Kyle MacLachlan , George van Smoot ( known by his nickname `` The Captain '' ) is introduced as Zoey Pierson 's husband at a gala at the Natural History Museum . He is obsessed with boats , an interest that Zoey does not share . Despite the Captain 's frightening demeanor , such as the murderous look he has in his eyes , he proves to be generous , if rather eccentric ; he is also seen to be somewhat shy because of the apparent age gap between him and most of Zoey 's peers . While he comes to like Ted , Ted 's fear of the Captain is exacerbated by the fact that Ted and Zoey are attracted to one another . Zoey eventually divorces the Captain and leaves him for Ted . A year after Ted breaks up with Zoey , the Captain unexpectedly runs into Ted , Robin and Lily at a gallery show . He reveals that he holds no hard feelings for Ted regarding his divorce with Zoey . During the gallery show , Lily 's advice about artwork , while initially dismissed by the Captain , proves to be invaluable and the Captain ends up hiring Lily as his new art consultant in `` The Ashtray '' . He announces his intention to move to Rome for a year and asks for Lily and her family to accompany him ; following a fight between Marshall and Lily , they do live in Italy for a year . The Captain has three Olympic gold medals in fencing and ends up engaged to Becky .
