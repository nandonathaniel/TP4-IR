Particularly , the Porter 's speech ( 2.3. 1 -- 21 ) in which he welcomes an `` equivocator '' , a farmer , and a tailor to hell ( 2.3. 8 -- 13 ) , has been argued to be an allusion to the 28 March 1606 trial and execution on 3 May 1606 of the Jesuit Henry Garnet , who used the alias `` Farmer '' , with `` equivocator '' referring to Garnet 's defence of `` equivocation '' . The porter says that the equivocator `` committed treason enough for God 's sake '' ( 2.3. 9 -- 10 ) , which specifically connects equivocation and treason and ties it to the Jesuit belief that equivocation was only lawful when used `` for God 's sake '' , strengthening the allusion to Garnet . The porter goes on to say that the equivocator `` yet could not equivocate to heaven '' ( 2.3. 10 -- 11 ) , echoing grim jokes that were current on the eve of Garnet 's execution : i.e. that Garnet would be `` hanged without equivocation '' and at his execution he was asked `` not to equivocate with his last breath . '' The `` English tailor '' the porter admits to hell ( 2.3. 13 ) , has been seen as an allusion to Hugh Griffin , a tailor who was questioned by the Archbishop of Canterbury on 27 November and 3 December 1607 for the part he played in Garnet 's `` miraculous straw '' , an infamous head of straw that was stained with Garnet 's blood that had congealed into a form resembling Garnet 's portrait , which was hailed by Catholics as a miracle . The tailor Griffin became notorious and the subject of verses published with his portrait on the title page .
