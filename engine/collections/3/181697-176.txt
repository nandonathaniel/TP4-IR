Tchaikovsky was less satisfied with The Nutcracker than with The Sleeping Beauty . ( In the film Fantasia , commentator Deems Taylor observes that he `` really detested '' the score . ) Tchaikovsky accepted the commission from Vsevolozhsky but did not particularly want to write the ballet ( though he did write to a friend while composing it : `` I am daily becoming more and more attuned to my task '' ) .
