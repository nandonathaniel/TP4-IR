Between 2009 and 2010 , following the Great Recession , the emerging problem of jobless recoveries resulted in record levels of long - term unemployment with over 6 million workers looking for work for more than 6 months as of January 2010 . This particularly affected older workers . A year after the recession ended in June 2009 , immigrants gained 656,000 jobs in the US , while U.S. - born workers lost more than a million jobs , due in part to an aging country ( relatively more white retirees ) and demographic shifts . In April 2010 , the official unemployment rate was 9.9 % , but the government 's broader U-6 unemployment rate was 17.1 % . Between February 2008 and February 2010 , the number of people working part - time for economic reasons ( i.e. , would prefer to work full - time ) increased by 4 million to 8.8 million , an 83 % increase in part - time workers during the two - year period .
