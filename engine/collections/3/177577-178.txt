Peter Turchin in his Historical Dynamics and Andrey Korotayev et al. in their Introduction to Social Macrodynamics , Secular Cycles , and Millennial Trends suggest a number of mathematical models describing collapse of agrarian civilizations . For example , the basic logic of Turchin 's `` fiscal - demographic '' model can be outlined as follows : during the initial phase of a sociodemographic cycle we observe relatively high levels of per capita production and consumption , which leads not only to relatively high population growth rates , but also to relatively high rates of surplus production . As a result , during this phase the population can afford to pay taxes without great problems , the taxes are quite easily collectible , and the population growth is accompanied by the growth of state revenues . During the intermediate phase , the increasing overpopulation leads to the decrease of per capita production and consumption levels , it becomes more and more difficult to collect taxes , and state revenues stop growing , whereas the state expenditures grow due to the growth of the population controlled by the state . As a result , during this phase the state starts experiencing considerable fiscal problems . During the final pre-collapse phases the overpopulation leads to further decrease of per capita production , the surplus production further decreases , state revenues shrink , but the state needs more and more resources to control the growing ( though with lower and lower rates ) population . Eventually this leads to famines , epidemics , state breakdown , and demographic and civilization collapse ( Peter Turchin . Historical Dynamics .
