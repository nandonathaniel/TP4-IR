Lewis Campbell was the first to make exhaustive use of stylometry to prove objectively that the Critias , Timaeus , Laws , Philebus , Sophist , and Statesman were all clustered together as a group , while the Parmenides , Phaedrus , Republic , and Theaetetus belong to a separate group , which must be earlier ( given Aristotle 's statement in his Politics that the Laws was written after the Republic ; cf . Diogenes Laertius Lives 3.37 ) . What is remarkable about Campbell 's conclusions is that , in spite of all the stylometric studies that have been conducted since his time , perhaps the only chronological fact about Plato 's works that can now be said to be proven by stylometry is the fact that Critias , Timaeus , Laws , Philebus , Sophist , and Statesman are the latest of Plato 's dialogues , the others earlier .
