The etymology of the name is at present contested . Robert S.P. Beekes has suggested a Pre-Greek origin . Others connect the name to σειρά ( seirá `` rope , cord '' ) and εἴρω ( eírō `` to tie , join , fasten '' ) , resulting in the meaning `` binder , entangler '' , i . e. one who binds or entangles through magic song . This could be connected to the famous scene of Odysseus being bound to the mast of his ship , in order to resist their song .
