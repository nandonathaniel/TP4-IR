During several of the summer months of the year 1783 , when the effect of the sun 's rays to heat the earth in these northern regions should have been greater , there existed a constant fog over all Europe , and a great part of North America . This fog was of a permanent nature ; it was dry , and the rays of the sun seemed to have little effect towards dissipating it , as they easily do a moist fog , arising from water . They were indeed rendered so faint in passing through it , that when collected in the focus of a burning glass they would scarce kindle brown paper . Of course , their summer effect in heating the Earth was exceedingly diminished . Hence the surface was early frozen . Hence the first snows remained on it unmelted , and received continual additions . Hence the air was more chilled , and the winds more severely cold . Hence perhaps the winter of 1783 -- 4 was more severe than any that had happened for many years .
