Just before Stamford , the Great North Road , now labelled the A1 , crosses the river , and a pumping station on the north bank at Stamford Meadows has pumped large quantities of water to the Rutland Water reservoir since its construction in 1975 . Stamford was the lowest point at which the river could be forded so the Roman Ermine Street crossed the Welland there . The A16 road crosses the river by a three - arched stone bridge designed by Edward Browning in 1845 . Below it , Albert Bridge is made of iron with stone piers , and was erected by Stamford Town Council in July 1881 , to replace an earlier bridge which was washed away in a flood . Beyond Stamford , the river passes the site and ruins of the Benedictine St Leonard 's Priory . Hudd 's Mill marks the point at which the Stamford Canal left the river . The present mill building dates from 1751 and 1771 . The River Gwash , which the canal crossed on the level , joins from the north , and the remains of the canal follow the river on its north bank . Below Uffington , the county border follows the old course of the river , first to the south to Tallington and then to the north , while the main course now flows along the Maxey Cut to Peakirk . The old course consists of two streams , fed by sluices from the Maxey Cut , which meander to The Deepings . The eastern stream supplied power to Lolham and Maxey mills , while the western stream did the same for Tallington Mill , which dates from around 1700 , West Deeping mill , and Molecey 's mill , which still retains its seventeenth - century undershot waterwheel , modified in the 19th century to Poncelet 's improved design , and the only surviving waterwheel of its type in Lincolnshire . At the western edge of Market Deeping the two streams join , and they are also joined by the Greatford Cut , which has carried the diverted waters of the West Glen river since the early 1950s .
