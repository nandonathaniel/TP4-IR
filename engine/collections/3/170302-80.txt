The older skyscrapers often were built with elaborate facade , which have not been common in corporate architecture for decades ; the nearby World Trade Center , built in the 1970s , was very plain and utilitarian in comparison . Excavation from the World Trade Center was later used as landfill for Battery Park City residential developments . 23 Wall Street , built in 1914 , was known as the `` House of Morgan '' and served for decades as the bank 's headquarters and , by some accounts , was viewed as an important address in American finance . Cosmetic damage from the 1920 Wall Street bombing is still visible on the Wall Street side of this building .
