According to director Joshua Logan , a friend of both theatre men , he and Leland Hayward mentioned Michener 's best - selling book to Rodgers as a possible basis for the duo 's next play , but the composer took no action . Logan recalled that he then pointed it out to Hammerstein , who read Michener 's book and spoke to Rodgers ; the two agreed to do the project so long as they had majority control , to which Hayward grudgingly agreed . Michener , in his 1992 memoirs , however , wrote that the stories were first pitched as a movie concept to MGM by Kenneth MacKenna , head of the studio 's literary department . MacKenna 's half brother was Jo Mielziner , who had designed the sets for Carousel and Allegro . Michener states that Mielziner learned of the work from MacKenna and brought it to the attention of Hammerstein and Rodgers , pledging to create the sets if they took on the project .
