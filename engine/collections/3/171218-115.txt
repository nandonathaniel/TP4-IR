Race director As of 2017 , the race director in Formula One is Charlie Whiting . This role involves him generally managing the logistics of each F1 Grand Prix , inspecting cars in parc fermé before a race , enforcing FIA rules and controlling the lights which start each race . As the head of the race officials , he also plays a large role in sorting disputes amongst teams and drivers . Penalties , such as drive - through penalties ( and stop - and - go penalties ) , demotions on a pre-race start grid , race disqualifications , and fines can all be handed out should parties break regulations . Safety car In the event of an incident that risks the safety of competitors or trackside race marshals , race officials may choose to deploy the safety car . This in effect suspends the race , with drivers following the safety car around the track at its speed in race order , with overtaking not permitted . The safety car circulates until the danger is cleared ; after it comes in , the race restarts with a `` rolling start '' . Pit stops are permitted under the safety car . Mercedes - Benz supplies Mercedes - AMG models to Formula One to use as the safety cars . Since 2000 , the main safety car driver has been German ex-racing driver Bernd Mayländer . On the lap in which the safety car returns to the pits , the leading car takes over the role of the safety car until the first safety car line , which is usually a white line after the pit lane entrance . After crossing this line , drivers are allowed to start racing for track position once more .
