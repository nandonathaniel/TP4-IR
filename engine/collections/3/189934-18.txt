The show was put into syndication in September 2007 , to be offered by local television stations on a weekday basis in the United States by Litton Entertainment . However , the Litton versions of the program were severely edited and changed . Any references to MTV were scrubbed out , and the program received a new logo referring to it as just Cribs , while all music that was played in the original episodes was replaced by production music to avoid royalty fees . Although Lewis and Pak were still listed in the episode credits as narrators , all narration was stripped in the re-edited episodes , and ' coming up ' segments were either silent or voiced by an uncredited announcer . The syndicated version was unsuccessful and offered in barter form , mainly on the lower - rated stations in many markets in abysmal timeslots , and was removed in September 2008 from the market .
