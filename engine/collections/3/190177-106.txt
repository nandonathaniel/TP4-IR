Excessive devotion and enthusiasm in religious observance were superstitio , in the sense of `` doing or believing more than was necessary '' , to which women and foreigners were considered particularly prone . The boundaries between religio and superstitio are perhaps indefinite . The famous tirade of Lucretius , the Epicurean rationalist , against what is usually translated as `` superstition '' was in fact aimed at excessive religio . Roman religion was based on knowledge rather than faith , but superstitio was viewed as an `` inappropriate desire for knowledge '' ; in effect , an abuse of religio .
