At the Last Glacial Maximum , continuous permafrost covered a much greater area than it does today , covering all of ice - free Europe south to about Szeged ( southeastern Hungary ) and the Sea of Azov ( then dry land ) and East Asia south to present - day Changchun and Abashiri . In North America , only an extremely narrow belt of permafrost existed south of the ice sheet at about the latitude of New Jersey through southern Iowa and northern Missouri , but permafrost was more extensive in the drier western regions where it extended to the southern border of Idaho and Oregon . In the southern hemisphere , there is some evidence for former permafrost from this period in central Otago and Argentine Patagonia , but was probably discontinuous , and is related to the tundra . Alpine permafrost also occurred in the Drakensberg during glacial maxima above about 3,000 metres ( 9,840 ft ) .
