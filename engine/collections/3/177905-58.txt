There have been several models developed to explain social effects on language acquisition . Schumann 's Acculturation Model proposes that learners ' rate of development and ultimate level of language achievement is a function of the `` social distance '' and the `` psychological distance '' between learners and the second - language community . In Schumann 's model the social factors are most important , but the degree to which learners are comfortable with learning the second language also plays a role . Another sociolinguistic model is Gardner 's socio - educational model , which was designed to explain classroom language acquisition . Gardner 's model focuses on the emotional aspects of SLA , arguing that positive motivation contributes to an individuals willingness to learn L2 ; furthermore , the goal of an individual to learn a L2 is based on the idea that the individual has a desire to be part of a culture , in other words , part of a ( the targeted language ) mono - linguistic community . Factors , such as integrativeness and attitudes towards the learning situation drive motivation . The outcome of positive motivation is not only linguistic , but non-linguistic , such that the learner has met the desired goal . Although there are many critics of Gardner 's model , nonetheless many of these critics have been influenced by the merits that his model holds . The inter-group model proposes `` ethnolinguistic vitality '' as a key construct for second - language acquisition . Language socialization is an approach with the premise that `` linguistic and cultural knowledge are constructed through each other '' , and saw increased attention after the year 2000 . Finally , Norton 's theory of social identity is an attempt to codify the relationship between power , identity , and language acquisition .
