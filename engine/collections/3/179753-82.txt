Also , Ollie 's supposed email address was printed in the tour programme . One fan , after sending an email and discovering the address did n't exist , decided to set up the account in his own name , thereafter acting as Ollie on the dedicated forums and MSN Messenger . This mystery lasted for a short while until his identity was revealed as being a fan , with the `` real '' Ollie ( Shearsmith ) having no affiliation with it , although it was referenced in a blog on the official website .
