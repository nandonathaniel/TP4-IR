Although Warwick , Henry VI and Edward of Lancaster are all dead , the court is unsettled . Elizabeth is concerned by Edward 's growing attraction to his new mistress , Jane Shore . She is devastated by the death of a baby son shortly after birth , coinciding with the death of her mother Jacquetta ; her distress causes Edward to reaffirm his love for her . Meanwhile , George attempts to control the widowed Anne Neville and obtain sole access to the Neville inheritance by locking her away and threatening her with a convent . Anne 's upset is further increased as Isabel sides with George ; her only friend is the King 's youngest brother , Richard , who eventually snatches Anne from Clarence 's grasp and marries her . The fanatical Margaret Beaufort tries to increase her power by re-marrying to one of King Edward 's closest advisers , Thomas Stanley .
