This bizarre command structure went against the grain of the Air Force 's single air manager concept , which dictated that one commander was to control and coordinate all aircraft within a combat theater . The chain through which operational strike requests had to flow gave some indication of the growing overcomplexity of the campaign . Requests for airstrikes originated with the 2nd Air Division and Task Force 77 in Vietnam and then proceeded to CINCPAC , who in turn reported to his superiors , the Joint Chiefs , at the Pentagon . After input from the State Department and the CIA , the requests then proceeded to the White House , where the president and his `` Tuesday Cabinet '' made decisions on the strike requests on a weekly basis .
