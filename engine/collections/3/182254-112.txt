Spoofs of other programs were a regular feature in the early years . This began with caustic voice - overs of old TV shows , ( comparable to the much later American program Mystery Science Theater 3000 and similar to other Australian comedy efforts including the `` Europa Films '' segments of The Aunty Jack Show and the 1980s live comedy team Double Take ) . Later , this expanded into ongoing comedy sketches such as Division Saturday ( a parody of Division 4 ) , The Sillivans ( The Sullivans ) and The Shove Boat ( The Love Boat ) .
