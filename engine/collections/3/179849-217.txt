In a 2011 interview with Rotten Tomatoes , actor William Fichtner retrospectively stated that he and his partner were silenced after seeing the film , stating that `` the human experience was just so pointed ; their journeys were so difficult , as life is sometimes . I remember after seeing it , walking down the street -- I actually went with a girl on a date and saw The Deer Hunter , and we left the theater and walked for like an hour and nobody said anything ; we were just kind of stunned about that .
