Several critics regarded the film as inferior to its 1991 animated predecessor . David Sims of The Atlantic wrote that the 2017 film `` feels particularly egregious , in part , because it 's so slavishly devoted to the original ; every time it falls short of its predecessor ( which is quite often ) , it 's hard not to notice '' . Michael Phillips of the Chicago Tribune said that the 2017 film `` takes our knowledge and our interest in the material for granted . It zips from one number to another , throwing a ton of frenetically edited eye candy at the screen , charmlessly . '' Phillips wrote that the film featured some `` less conspicuously talented '' performers who are `` stuck doing karaoke , or motion - capture work of middling quality '' , though he praised Kline 's performance as the `` best , sweetest thing in the movie ; he brings a sense of calm , droll authority '' . Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian praised Watson 's performance and wrote that the film was `` lit in that fascinatingly artificial honey - glow light , and it runs smoothly on rails -- the kind of rails that bring in and out the stage sets for the lucrative Broadway touring version . '' In the same newspaper , Wendy Ide criticized the film as `` ornate to the point of desperation '' in its attempt to emulate the animated film .
