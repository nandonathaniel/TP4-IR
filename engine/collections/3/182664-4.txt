Alger Hiss served as a legal assistant ( counsel ) to the committee from July 1934 to August 1935 . ( In 1948 , Hiss was one of several members of the Ware Group alleged by Whittaker Chambers to have infiltrated the Federal government on behalf of Soviet intelligence . Alone of those accused , Hiss was indicted in December 1948 , tried twice in May and November 1949 , and sentenced for perjury in 1952 . ) Most famously , Hiss `` badgered '' DuPont officials and questioned and cross-examined Bernard Baruch on March 29 , 1935 . In 1947 , however , Baruch and Hiss both attended the burial of Nicholas Murray Butler . Hiss himself later called Baruch `` vain and overrated Polonius much given to trite pronouncements about the nation . ''
