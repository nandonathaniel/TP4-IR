The Union Army relied on the labor of newly freed people , and did not always treat them fairly . Thomas W. Knox wrote : `` The difference between working for nothing as a slave , and working for the same wages under the Yankees , was not always perceptible . '' At the same time , military officials resisted local attempts to apply pre-war laws to the freed people . After the Emancipation Proclamation , the Army conscripted Black `` vagrants '' and sometimes others .
