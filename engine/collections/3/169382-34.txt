In 1999 , Jon Lech Johansen released an application called DeCSS , which allowed a CSS - encrypted DVD to play on a computer running the Linux operating system , at a time when no licensed DVD player application for Linux had yet been created . The legality of DeCSS is questionable : one of the authors has been the subject of a lawsuit , and reproduction of the keys themselves is subject to restrictions as illegal numbers .
