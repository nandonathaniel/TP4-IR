Also in Ireland there is a female spirit known as Banshee , who heralds the death of a person , usually by shrieking or keening . The banshee is often described in Gaelic lore as wearing red or green , usually with long , disheveled hair . She can appear in a variety of forms . Perhaps most often she is seen as an ugly , frightful hag , but she can also appear as young and beautiful if she chooses . In Ireland and parts of Scotland , a traditional part of mourning is the keening woman ( bean chaointe ) , who wails a lament -- in Irish : Caoineadh , caoin meaning `` to weep , to wail '' . When several banshees appear at once , it indicates the death of someone great or holy . The tales sometimes recounted that the woman , though called a fairy , was a ghost , often of a specific murdered woman , or a mother who died in childbirth .
