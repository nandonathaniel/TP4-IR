Not long after the incident of the poulpes , Nemo suddenly changes his behavior toward Aronnax , avoiding him . Aronnax no longer feels the same and begins to sympathize with Ned Land . Near the end of the book , the Nautilus is attacked by a warship of some nation that had made Nemo suffer . Filled with hatred and revenge , Nemo ignores Aronnax 's pleas for mercy .

No one seems to be on board any longer and the Nautilus moves about randomly .

One evening , Ned Land announces an opportunity to escape . Although Aronnax wants to leave Nemo , whom he now holds in horror , he still wishes to see him for the last time . But he knows that Nemo would never let him escape , so he has to avoid meeting him . Before the escape , however , he sees him one last time ( although secretly ) , and hears him say `` Almighty God ! Enough ! Enough ! '' .
