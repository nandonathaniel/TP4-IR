Chromosome replication in bacteria is regulated at the initiation stage . DnaA - ATP is hydrolyzed into the inactive DnaA - ADP by RIDA ( Regulatory Inactivation of DnaA ) , and converted back to the active DnaA - ATP form by DARS ( DnaA Reactivating Sequence , which is itself regulated by Fis and IHF ) . However , the main source of DnaA - ATP is synthesis of new molecules . Meanwhile , several other proteins interact directly with the oriC sequence to regulate initiation , usually by inhibition . In E. coli these proteins include DiaA , SeqA , IciA , HU , and ArcA - P , but they vary across other bacterial species . A few other mechanisms in E. coli that variously regulate initiation are DDAH ( datA - Dependent DnaA Hydrolysis , which is also regulated by IHF ) , inhibition of the dnaA gene ( by the SeqA protein ) , and reactivation of DnaA by the lipid membrane .
