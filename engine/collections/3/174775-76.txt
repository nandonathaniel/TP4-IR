In the original X-bar theory , the two respective types of entity are called noun phrase ( NP ) and N - bar ( N , N â€² ) . Thus in the sentence Here is the big house , both house and big house are N - bars , while the big house is a noun phrase . In the sentence I like big houses , both houses and big houses are N - bars , but big houses also functions as a noun phrase ( in this case without an explicit determiner ) .
