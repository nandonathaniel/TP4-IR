In physics , the dynamo theory proposes a mechanism by which a celestial body such as Earth or a star generates a magnetic field . The dynamo theory describes the process through which a rotating , convecting , and electrically conducting fluid can maintain a magnetic field over astronomical time scales . A dynamo is thought to be the source of the Earth 's magnetic field , as well as the magnetic fields of other planets .
