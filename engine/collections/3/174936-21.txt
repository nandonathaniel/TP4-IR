Generally Gyrinids lay their eggs under water , attached to water plants , typically in rows . Like the adults , the larvae are active predators , largely benthic inhabitants of the stream bed and aquatic plants . They have long thoracic legs with paired claws . Their mandibles are curved , pointed , and pierced with a sucking canal . In this they resemble the larvae of many other predatory water beetles , such as the Dytiscidae . Mature larvae pupate in a cocoon that also is attached to water plants .
