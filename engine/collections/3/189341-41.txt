Leonid Derkach : Leonid Danilovich . We 've got some interesting material here from the Germans . One of them has been arrested . Leonid Kuchma ( reading aloud ) : Ritter , Rudolf Ritter . Leonid Derkach : Yes , and about that affair , the drug smuggling . Here are the documents . They gave them all out . Here 's Vova Putin , too . Leonid Kuchma : There 's something about Putin there ? Leonid Derkach : The Russians have already been buying everything up . Here are all the documents . We 're the only ones that still have them now . I think that ( FSB chief ) Nikolai Patrushev is coming from the 15th to the 17th . This will give him something to work with . This is what we 'll keep . They want to shove the whole affair under the carpet .
