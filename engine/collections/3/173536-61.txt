Michael Huber from GameTrailers scored the game an 8.5 out if 10 and wrote : `` Visual Concepts has done a commendable job with just one year of development . NBA 2K16 boasts many on - court improvements over last year , most notably on defensive that help create a better flow during games . Although the microtransactions devalue certain aspects of the game , and Pro-AM has connection issues , the on - court changes and additions are worth checking out for basketball enthusiasts . ''
