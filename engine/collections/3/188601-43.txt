Towards the end of 2009 , FCC Chair Julius Genachowski announced at the Brookings Institution a series of proposals that would prevent telecommunications , cable and wireless companies from blocking certain information on the Internet , for example , Skype applications . In September 2009 , he proposed to add two rules to its 2005 policy statement , viz. , the nondiscrimination principle that ISPs must not discriminate against any content or applications , and the transparency principle , requiring that ISPs disclose all their policies to customers . He argued that wireless should be subject to the same network neutrality as wireline providers . In October 2009 , the FCC gave notice of proposed rule making on net neutrality .
