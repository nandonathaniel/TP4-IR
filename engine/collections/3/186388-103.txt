Shimla has a number of places to visit . Local hangouts like the Mall and the Ridge are in the heart of the city . Most of the heritage buildings in the city are preserved in their original ' Tudorbethan ' architecture . The former Viceregal Lodge , which now houses the Indian Institute of Advanced Study , and Wildflower Hall , now a luxury hotel , are some of the famous ones . A collection of paintings , jewellery and textiles of the region can be found at the State Museum ( built in 1974 ) .
