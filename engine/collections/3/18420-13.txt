Kingston lost its most influential advocate as permanent site of the Hockey Hall of Fame when Sutherland died in 1955 . By 1958 , the Hockey Hall of Fame had still not raised sufficient funds to construct a permanent building in Kingston . Clarence Campbell , then President of the NHL , grew tired of waiting for the construction to begin and withdrew the NHL 's support to situate the hall in Kingston . In the same year , the NHL and the Canadian National Exhibition ( CNE ) reached an agreement to establish a new Hall of Fame building in Toronto , in the Canadian Sports Hall of Fame located at Exhibition Place . The temporary Hockey Hall of Fame opened as an exhibit within the Canadian Sports Hall of Fame in August 1958 , and 350,000 people visited it during the 1958 CNE fair . Due to the success of the exhibit , NHL and CNE decided that a permanent home in the Exhibition Place was needed . The NHL agreed to fully fund the building of the new facility on the grounds of Exhibition Place , and construction began in 1960 .
