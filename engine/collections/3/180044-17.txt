Chapter Seven -- The Lion and the Unicorn : `` All the king 's horses and all the king 's men '' come to Humpty Dumpty 's assistance , and are accompanied by the White King , along with the Lion and the Unicorn , who again proceed to act out a nursery rhyme by fighting with each other . In this chapter , the March Hare and Hatter of the first book make a brief re-appearance in the guise of `` Anglo - Saxon messengers '' called `` Haigha '' and `` Hatta '' ( i.e. `` Hare '' and `` Hatter '' -- these names are the only hint given as to their identities other than John Tenniel 's illustrations ) .
