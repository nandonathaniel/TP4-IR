Cruising along the California coastline , the guys know they 're in for something big . Mil Blair founded the iconic motorcycle magazine Easyriders , and for the first time ever , the legend is willing to sell some of his rare collections of motorbikes and memorabilia . Later , the guys visit Bird 's temple of surfing . Although he does n't normally sell , the guys convince him to part with a few choice surfboards . Also , the guys visit Alfie in the Malibu Hills . His eclectic collection includes over a half million albums and a real bombshell . And finally , they get their new surfboards appraised at the California Surf Museum and make a generous donation .
