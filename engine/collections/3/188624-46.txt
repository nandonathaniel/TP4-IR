Usually , the more complex the reactant molecules , the lower the steric factor . Nevertheless , some reactions exhibit steric factors greater than unity : the harpoon reactions , which involve atoms that exchange electrons , producing ions . The deviation from unity can have different causes : the molecules are not spherical , so different geometries are possible ; not all the kinetic energy is delivered into the right spot ; the presence of a solvent ( when applied to solutions ) , etc .
