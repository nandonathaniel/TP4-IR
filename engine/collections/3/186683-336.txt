As Brainstorm , with the Omnitrix / Ultimatrix symbol in his cephalothorax , Ben speaks with much greater diction and with a British accent . He was first seen in `` Pier Pressure '' , to face Ship , but was an accidental transformation . In Omniverse , Brainstorm has black and green stripes ; one in the center of his head , while the other goes under him . He now speaks with a Swedish accent .
