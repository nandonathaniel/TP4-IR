`` Baseball 's Sad Lexicon , '' also known as `` Tinker to Evers to Chance '' after its refrain , is a 1910 baseball poem by Franklin Pierce Adams . The poem is presented as a single , rueful stanza from the point of view of a New York Giants fan seeing the talented Chicago Cubs infield of shortstop Joe Tinker , second baseman Johnny Evers , and first baseman Frank Chance complete a double play . The trio began playing together with the Cubs in 1902 , and formed a double play combination that lasted through April 1912 . The Cubs won the pennant four times between 1906 and 1910 , often defeating the Giants en route to the World Series .
