With early induction and ignition systems the compression ratios had to be kept low . With advances in fuel technology and combustion management , high performance engines can run reliably at 12 : 1 ratio . With low octane fuel , a problem would occur as the compression ratio increased as the fuel was igniting due to the rise in temperature that resulted . Charles Kettering developed a lead additive which allowed higher compression ratios , which was progressively abandoned for automotive use from the 1970s onward , partly due to lead poisoning concerns .
