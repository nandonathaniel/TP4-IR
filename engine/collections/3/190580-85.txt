Limited Authority : The majority of the PPP Units reviewed in the literature do not play a particularly important role in approving or rejecting PPP programmes or projects . Whilst their advice is used in the decision making process by other government bodies , the majority do not actually have any executive power to make such decisions themselves . Hence , when they have more authority their value is seen to be higher .
