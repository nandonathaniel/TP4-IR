Around the start of the 20th century , the Philippines pegged the silver peso / dollar to the U.S. dollar at 50 cents . This move was assisted by the passage of the Philippines Coinage Act by the United States Congress on March 3 , 1903 . Around the same time Mexico and Japan pegged their currencies to the dollar . When Siam adopted a gold exchange standard in 1908 , only China and Hong Kong remained on the silver standard .
