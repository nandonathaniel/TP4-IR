Eligible loan programs generally issue loans based on the credit history of the applicant and any applicable cosigner / co-endorser / coborrower . This is in contrast to federal loan programs that deal primarily with need - based criteria , as defined by the EFC and the FAFSA . For many students , this is a great advantage to private loan programs , as their families may have too much income or too many assets to qualify for federal aid but insufficient assets and income to pay for school without assistance . The benefit of a co-signer is that a lender considers the income and credit history of both the student and the co-signer , which improves the student 's chances of being approved for a student loan .
