Virgil goes on to explain how the Southern Hemisphere was once covered with dry land , but the land recoiled in horror to the north when Lucifer fell from Heaven and was replaced by the ocean . Meanwhile , the inner rock Lucifer displaced as he plunged into the center of the earth rushed upwards to the surface of the Southern Hemisphere to avoid contact with him , forming the Mountain of Purgatory . This mountain -- the only land mass in the waters of the Southern Hemisphere -- rises above the surface at a point directly opposite Jerusalem . The poets then ascend a narrow chasm of rock through the `` space contained between the floor formed by the convex side of Cocytus and the underside of the earth above , '' moving in opposition to Lethe , the river of oblivion , which flows down from the summit of Mount Purgatory . The poets finally emerge a little before dawn on the morning of Easter Sunday ( April 10 , 1300 A.D. ) beneath a sky studded with stars .
