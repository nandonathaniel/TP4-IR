The Movement for the Restoration of the Ten Commandments of God was a breakaway religious movement from the Roman Catholic Church founded by Credonia Mwerinde , Joseph Kibweteere and Bee Tait in Uganda . It was formed in the late 1980s after Mwerinde , a brewer of banana beer , and Kibweteere , a politician , claimed that they had visions of the Virgin Mary . The five primary leaders were Joseph Kibweteere , Joseph Kasapurari , John Kamagara , Dominic Kataribabo , and Credonia Mwerinde . In early 2000 , followers of the religious movement perished in a devastating fire and a series of poisonings and killings that were either a group suicide or an orchestrated mass murder by group leaders after their predictions of the apocalypse failed to come about . In their coverage of that event , BBC News and The New York Times referred to the Movement as a Doomsday cult .
