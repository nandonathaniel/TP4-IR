The present Convention on the Law of the Sea ( UNCLOS ) was drafted in 1982 and came into force in 1994 . It states that `` the high seas are open to all states , whether coastal or land - locked '' and provides a non-exhaustive list of freedoms including navigation , overflight , the laying of submarine cables , the building of artificial islands , fishing , and scientific research . It extended territorial waters up to 12 nautical miles ( 22.2 km or 13.8 mi ) from a baseline generally ( but not always ) equivalent to the low - water line ; this area is subject to national laws but free to both innocent and transit passage . ( The `` internal waters '' landward of the baseline are solely under national control . ) A `` contiguous zone '' of a further 12 nmi are permitted for hot pursuit of vessels charged with violating customs , taxation , immigration , or pollution laws in the territorial waters . An `` exclusive economic zone '' or EEZ places all exploitation of marine life and minerals within 200 nmi ( 370 km or 230 mi ) of the baseline under national supervision . For legal purposes , the `` continental shelf '' is considered to be the actual continental shelf ( to a depth of 200 m or 660 ft ) contiguous to the baseline or 200 nmi , whichever is greater ; the marine life and minerals `` attached to '' ( or below ) the seabed within this area also fall under national supervision .
