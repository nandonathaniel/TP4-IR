On February 27 , 1992 , Stella Liebeck , a 79 - year - old woman from Albuquerque , New Mexico , ordered a 49 - cent cup of coffee from the drive - through window of a local McDonald 's restaurant located at 5001 Gibson Boulevard Southeast . Liebeck was in the passenger 's seat of a 1989 Ford Probe which did not have cup holders . Her grandson parked the car so that Liebeck could add cream and sugar to her coffee . Liebeck placed the coffee cup between her knees and pulled the far side of the lid toward her to remove it . In the process , she spilled the entire cup of coffee on her lap . Liebeck was wearing cotton sweatpants ; they absorbed the coffee and held it against her skin , scalding her thighs , buttocks , and groin .
