The Grand Jury Clause of the Fifth Amendment does not protect those serving in the armed forces , whether during wartime or peacetime . Members of the state militia called up to serve with federal forces are not protected under the clause either . In O'Callahan v. Parker , 395 U.S. 258 ( 1969 ) , the Supreme Court held that only charges relating to service may be brought against members of the militia without indictments . That decision was overturned in 1987 , when the Court held that members of the militia in actual service may be tried for any offense without indictments .
