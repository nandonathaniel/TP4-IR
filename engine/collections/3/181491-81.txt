Combining both modern and traditional architecture , Beijing is one of the oldest cities in the world , with a rich history dating back three millennia . As the last of the Four Great Ancient Capitals of China , Beijing has been the political center of the country for most of the past eight centuries , and was the largest city in the world by population for much of the second millennium A.D. Encyclop√¶dia Britannica notes that `` few cities in the world have served for so long as the political headquarters and cultural center of an area as immense as China . '' With mountains surrounding the inland city on three sides , in addition to the old inner and outer city walls , Beijing was strategically poised and developed to be the residence of the emperor and thus was the perfect location for the imperial capital . The city is renowned for its opulent palaces , temples , parks , gardens , tombs , walls and gates . It has seven UNESCO World Heritage Sites -- the Forbidden City , Temple of Heaven , Summer Palace , Ming Tombs , Zhoukoudian , and parts of the Great Wall and the Grand Canal -- all popular locations for tourism . Siheyuans , the city 's traditional housing style , and hutongs , the narrow alleys between siheyuans , are major tourist attractions and are common in urban Beijing .
