Unlike club football leagues in other countries , Major League Soccer does not have promotion and relegation , and instead utilizes a franchise system similar to other professional sports leagues in the country . In addition , Major League Soccer operates as a single entity , meaning that all clubs are owned by the league , with club investor - operators holding shares in the league itself rather than owning their teams directly , and all players being centrally contracted . Major League Soccer has faced criticisms for this structure , as well as other deviations such as scheduling matches during time periods designated by the FIFA Calendar for international play ( which can affect the quality of MLS matches taking place within , although the league had been working to reduce the number of matches during these windows ) . However , it has also been noted that the league 's salary caps have helped to discourage rampant spending , allowing for steadier long - term growth .
