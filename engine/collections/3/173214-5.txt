The petal whorl or corolla may be either radially or bilaterally symmetrical ( see Symmetry in biology and Floral symmetry ) . If all of the petals are essentially identical in size and shape , the flower is said to be regular or actinomorphic ( meaning `` ray - formed '' ) . Many flowers are symmetrical in only one plane ( i.e. , symmetry is bilateral ) and are termed irregular or zygomorphic ( meaning `` yoke - '' or `` pair - formed '' ) . In irregular flowers , other floral parts may be modified from the regular form , but the petals show the greatest deviation from radial symmetry . Examples of zygomorphic flowers may be seen in orchids and members of the pea family .
