In the parody wrestling series Celebrity Deathmatch , during a match between Lucy Lawless and Calista Flockhart ( the actress who played Ally McBeal ) , the dancing baby suddenly appears in the ring with his back turned to the camera . After a moment of dancing , he turns around and is shown to be Dennis Franz in nothing but a diaper ; referee Mills Lane shouts at him , `` I told you I did n't want you in my ring , Dennis Franz ! '' , to which an annoyed Franz leaves not before replying back , `` Alright , tough guy . ''
