In the 8th century , a famous epigram attributed to the Venerable Bede celebrated the symbolic significance of the statue in a prophecy that is variously quoted : Quamdiu stat Colisæus , stat et Roma ; quando cadet colisæus , cadet et Roma ; quando cadet Roma , cadet et mundus ( `` as long as the Colossus stands , so shall Rome ; when the Colossus falls , Rome shall fall ; when Rome falls , so falls the world '' ) . This is often mistranslated to refer to the Colosseum rather than the Colossus ( as in , for instance , Byron 's poem Childe Harold 's Pilgrimage ) . However , at the time that the Pseudo-Bede wrote , the masculine noun coliseus was applied to the statue rather than to what was still known as the Flavian amphitheatre .
