In modern usage , a definition is something , typically expressed in words , that attaches a meaning to a word or group of words . The word or group of words that is to be defined is called the definiendum , and the word , group of words , or action that defines it is called the definiens . In the definition `` An elephant is a large gray animal native to Asia and Africa '' , the word `` elephant '' is the definiendum , and everything after the word `` is '' is the definiens .
