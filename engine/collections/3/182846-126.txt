On May 6 , 2015 , the NFL published a 243 - page report regarding the deflation of footballs used in the previous season 's AFC Championship Game . The report concluded that , more likely than not , Brady was at least generally aware of the intentional deflation . On May 11 , Brady was suspended for four games by the NFL for his involvement based on `` substantial and credible evidence '' that Brady knew Patriots employees were deflating footballs and that he failed to cooperate with the investigators . On May 11 , Troy Vincent -- NFL Executive Vice President of Football Operations -- penned a letter to Brady that stated in part : `` Your actions as set forth in the report clearly constitute conduct detrimental to the integrity of and public confidence in the game of professional football . '' Vincent 's letter further stated : `` With respect to your particular involvement , the report established that there is substantial and credible evidence to conclude you were at least generally aware of the actions of the Patriots ' employees involved in the deflation of the footballs and that it was unlikely that their actions were done without your knowledge . Moreover , the report documents your failure to cooperate fully and candidly with the investigation , including by refusing to produce any relevant electronic evidence ( emails , texts , etc . ) , despite being offered extraordinary safeguards by the investigators to protect unrelated personal information , and by providing testimony that the report concludes was not plausible and contradicted by other evidence . '' Brady , through the NFL Players Association , officially appealed the suspension on May 14 .
