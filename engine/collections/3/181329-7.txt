As continental crust weathers and erodes , it degrades into mainly sands and clays . Many of these particles end up in streams and rivers that then dump into the ocean . Of all the sediment in the stream load , 80 % is then trapped and dispersed on continental margins . While modern river sediment is often still preserved closer to shore , continental shelves show high levels of glacial and relict sediments , deposited when sea level was lower . Often found on passive margins are several kilometers of sediment , consisting of terrigenous and carbonate ( biogenous ) deposits . These sediment reservoirs are often useful in the study of paleoceanography and the original formation of ocean basins . These deposits are often not well preserved on active margin shelves due to tectonic activity .
