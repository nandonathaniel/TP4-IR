Stamatios `` Tom '' Krimigis , head of the Applied Physics Laboratory 's space division , one of many entrants in the New Frontiers Program competition , formed the New Horizons team with Alan Stern in December 2000 . Appointed as the project 's principal investigator , Stern was described by Krimigis as `` the personification of the Pluto mission '' . New Horizons was based largely on Stern 's work since Pluto 350 and involved most of the team from Pluto Kuiper Express . The New Horizons proposal was one of five that were officially submitted to NASA . It was later selected as one of two finalists to be subject to a three - month concept study , in June 2001 . The other finalist , POSSE ( Pluto and Outer Solar System Explorer ) , was a separate , but similar Pluto mission concept by the University of Colorado Boulder , led by principal investigator Larry W. Esposito , and supported by the JPL , Lockheed Martin and the University of California . However , the APL , in addition to being supported by Pluto Kuiper Express developers at the Goddard Space Flight Center and Stanford University , were at an advantage ; they had recently developed NEAR Shoemaker for NASA , which had successfully entered orbit around 433 Eros earlier in the year , and would later land on the asteroid to scientific and engineering fanfare .
