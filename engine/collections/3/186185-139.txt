For practical considerations in thermodynamics or engineering , it is rarely necessary , convenient , nor even possible , to consider all energies belonging to the total intrinsic energy of a sample system , such as the energy given by the equivalence of mass . Typically , descriptions only include components relevant to the system under study . Indeed , in most systems under consideration , especially through thermodynamics , it is impossible to calculate the total internal energy . Therefore , a convenient null reference point may be chosen for the internal energy .
