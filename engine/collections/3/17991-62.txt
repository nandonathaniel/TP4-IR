Germaine Tailleferre of the French group Les Six wrote several works which could be considered to be inspired by Surrealism , including the 1948 Ballet Paris - Magie ( scenario by Lise Deharme ) , the Operas La Petite Sirène ( book by Philippe Soupault ) and Le Maître ( book by Eugène Ionesco ) . Tailleferre also wrote popular songs to texts by Claude Marci , the wife of Henri Jeanson , whose portrait had been painted by Magritte in the 1930s .
