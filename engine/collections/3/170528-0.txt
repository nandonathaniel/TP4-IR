The Exodus ( from Greek ἔξοδος exodos , `` going out '' ; Hebrew : יְצִיאַת מִצְרָיִם ‎ yetzi'at mitzrayim ) is the founding , or etiological , myth of Israel , telling how the Israelites were delivered from slavery by Yahweh and therefore belong to him through the Mosaic covenant . Spread over the books of Exodus , Leviticus , Numbers , and Deuteronomy , it tells of the events that befell the Israelites following the death of Joseph , their departure from Egypt , and their wanderings in the wilderness , including the revelations at Sinai , up to their arrival at the borders of Canaan .
