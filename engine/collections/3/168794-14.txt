The Delta Factor , Percy 's theory of language , is framed in the context of the story of Helen Keller 's learning to say and sign the word water while Annie Sullivan poured water over her hands and repeatedly made the signs for the word into her hand . A behaviorist linguistic reading of this scene might suggest a causal relationship -- in other words , Keller felt Sullivan 's sign - language stimulus in her hand and in response made a connection in her brain between the signifier and the signified . This is too simplistic a reading , says Percy , because Keller was receiving from both the signifier ( the sign for water ) and the referent ( the water itself ) . This creates a triangle between water ( the word ) , water ( the liquid ) , and Helen , in which all three corners lead to the other two corners and which Percy says is `` absolutely irreducible '' ( 40 ) . This linguistic triangle is thus the building block for all of human intelligence . The moment when this Delta Î” entered the mind of man -- whether this happened via random chance or through the intervention of a deity -- he became man .
