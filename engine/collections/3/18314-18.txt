On 22 August 2012 , Lionsgate announced that Claflin had been cast as Finnick Odair in The Hunger Games film series , starting with The Hunger Games : Catching Fire . Director of Catching Fire , Francis Lawrence , stated of Claflin 's performance during filming : `` Finnick 's an interesting character . At first he feels like a bit of a flirt and there 's a little bit of sexual tension , but really you kind of fall in love with the guy and you see that there 's a real deep emotional side to him . It 's one of the reasons I really hired him in the first place was that it 's where his character goes in the next couple of stories and I just think he did a fantastic job . '' The film was released in November 2013 to general acclaim and Claflin 's portrayal of Finnick received positive reviews . Claflin reprised the role in The Hunger Games : Mockingjay -- Part 1 , released in November 2014 , and Part 2 , released in November 2015 .
