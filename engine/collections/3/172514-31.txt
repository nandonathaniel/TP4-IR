Mount Meager has been investigated as a potential geothermal energy resource . At least 16 geothermal sites have been identified in British Columbia , the Mount Meager area being one of the five areas most capable of commercial development . At Meager Creek , there is potential for commercial development of a 100 -- 200 megawatt power station . Nearby Pebble Creek also has `` very good '' potential for a 200 megawatt plant . Because the two creeks offer the greatest potential for commercial development , the Mount Meager area is the most promising site for geothermal power development in British Columbia .
