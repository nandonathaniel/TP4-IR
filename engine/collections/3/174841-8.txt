The Donlin Gold project , in the Kuskokwim Gold Belt , contains a Proven and Probable Reserve of 33.8 million ounces at a grade of 2.09 g / t ( using a gold price of US $975 / oz ) , within a Measured and Indicated Resource of 39 million ounces of gold at 2.03 g / t . Donlin is one of the largest known undeveloped gold deposits in the world . If developed according to plans published in spring 2009 it will be one of the largest gold mines in the world . A large and robust series of felsic sills and dikes hosts the gold in association with small - scale quartz ( and lesser quartz and / or carbonate ) veinlets . The sills intrude a thick sequence ( 5000 + feet ) of non-metamorphosed , folded , graywacke , sandstone , and shale . The deposit occurs on private land owned by native corporations Calista Corporation and The Kuskokwim Corp . Donlin Creek LLC , equally owned by Barrick Gold and NovaGold Resources , holds a lease on the land and operates the project . Donlin Gold is expected to be a conventional open pit , truck - and - shovel operation . Production is expected to occur over 27 years . Pebble Copper , discovered in the mid-1980s , is one of the largest known copper - gold porphyry deposits in the world . It is located on State of Alaska - owned land . The deposit contains measured + indicated + inferred resources of 72 - billion pounds of copper , 94 - million ounces of gold , and 4.8 - billion pounds of molybdenum , within 9.1 billion tonnes of ore . Nixon Fork mine in the McGrath Mining District . First exploited in 1907 , this underground operation exploits high - grade gold skarn ore bodies along contacts between Cretaceous granitoid and metamorphosed Paleozoic sediments . The mine , after decades of inactivity , returned to production for several years in the mid-1990s , and again in 2006 and 2007 , when a significant variation between actual and predicted headgrades occurred . An updated resource evaluation is pending further work . The Niblack prospect , a zinc - copper - silver - gold VMS deposit on southeastern Prince of Wales Island , in the Ketchikan Mining District . Ore occurs as massive sulfide bodies hosted in a local rhyolite belt within a package of deeply deformed and metamorphosed volcanic and sedimentary rocks . In the last ten years , significant underground and surface exploration occurred at this early - 1900s minesite . A recent estimate reports a near surface indicated resource of 4073 kg of gold , 59,424 kg of silver , 14,810 metric tons of copper , and 30,474 metric tons of zinc contained in 1,424,000 metric tons of ore ; and deeper inferred resources of 3,919 kg of gold , 55,295 kg of silver , 31,235 metric tons of copper , and 106,192 metric tons of zinc within 1,893,000 metric tons of ore . Further exploration is planned . Many significant exploration efforts for gold , across the state , contributed to the total of over $310 million spent on mineral exploration in Alaska in 2007 .
