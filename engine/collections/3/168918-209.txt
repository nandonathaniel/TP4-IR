When the soil moisture content is optimal for plant growth , the water in the large and intermediate size pores can move about in the soil and be easily used by plants . The amount of water remaining in a soil drained to field capacity and the amount that is available are functions of the soil type . Sandy soil will retain very little water , while clay will hold the maximum amount . The time required to drain a field from flooded condition for a clay loam that begins at 43 % water by weight to a field capacity of 22 % is six days , whereas a sand loam that is flooded to its maximum of 22 % water will take two days to reach field capacity of 11 % water . The available water for the clay loam might be 11 % whereas for the sand loam it might be only 8 % by weight .
