Flaky is also shown to be close friends with Flippy as they are shown doing activities together such as playing hide & seek , going camping , and going to the movies . In Party Animal , she even organized a surprise birthday party for him . However , her friendship with Flippy has led to her death several times because of Flippy 's flip - outs . Interestingly , in Party Animal , Flippy did not kill Flaky even though she instigated the flip - out and she was right in front of him ( although she looked very different , puffed up , and Flippy did n't kill Mole either ) . In Double Whammy : Part 1 , her screams snapped him out of one of his flip - outs .
