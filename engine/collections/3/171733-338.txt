Inside a municipality , speed limit assignments are often a mystery on state - maintained roads . This could range from 15 to 55 mph depending on the type of roadway . This is because the state of Tennessee grants strong home rule powers to municipalities and Dillon 's Rule for unincorporated areas in the county for speed limit assignments on non-controlled access state - maintained roads , requiring that they fall within established constraints . Unlike other states , this weakens TennDOT 's ability to sign predictable speed limits in a reasonable and prudent matter . Also , Tennessee has a high percentage of roadways maintained by the counties .
