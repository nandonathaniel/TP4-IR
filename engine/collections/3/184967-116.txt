The English terms `` rejoice '' and `` glory '' stand for the same word in the Greek original . In Tyndale , Geneva and the Bishops ' Bibles , both instances are translated `` rejoice '' . In the Douay -- Rheims New Testament , both are translated `` glory '' . Only in the Authorized Version does the translation vary between the two verses .
