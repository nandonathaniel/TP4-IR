The first theory attributed to de Kruif and Holt , proposes that nanoclusters of calcium phosphate and the phosphopeptide fraction of beta - casein are the centerpiece to micellular structure . Specifically in this view , unstructured proteins organize around the calcium phosphate giving rise to their structure and thus no specific structure is formed .
