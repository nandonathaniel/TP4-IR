`` Brazil 's ethanol and biodiesel programmes are a benchmark for alternative and renewable fuel sources . Partnerships are being established with developing countries seeking to follow Brazil 's achievements -- a 675m - tonne reduction of greenhouse - gas emissions , a million new jobs and a drastic reduction in dependence on imported fossil fuels coming from a dangerously small number of producer countries . All of this has been accomplished without compromising food security , which , on the contrary , has benefited from rising agricultural output ... We are setting up offices in developing countries interested in benefiting from Brazilian know - how in this field . ''
