No other Friesian cattle were imported until the official importation of 1914 , which included several near descendants of the renowned dairy bull Ceres 4497 F.R.S. These cattle were successful in establishing the Friesian as an eminent , long - lived dairy breed in Britain . This role was continued in the 1922 importation from South Africa through Terling Marthus and Terling Collona , which were also near descendants of Ceres 4497 .
