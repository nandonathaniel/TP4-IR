Etna 's most destructive eruption since 122 BC started on 11 March 1669 and produced lava flows that destroyed at least 10 villages on its southern flank before reaching the city walls of the town of Catania five weeks later , on 15 April . The lava was largely diverted by these walls into the sea to the south of the city , filling the harbour of Catania . A small portion of lava eventually broke through a fragile section of the city walls on the western side of Catania and destroyed a few buildings before stopping in the rear of the Benedictine monastery , without reaching the centre of the town . Contrary to widespread reports of up to 15,000 ( or even 20,000 ) human fatalities caused by the lava , contemporaneous accounts written both in Italian and English mention no deaths related to the 1669 eruption ( but give very precise figures of the number of buildings destroyed , the area of cultivated land lost , and the economic damage ) . Therefore , it is uncertain where the enormous number of fatalities can be attributed . One possibility is confusion between this eruption and an earthquake that devastated southeast Sicily ( including Catania ) 24 years later in 1693 . A study on the damage and fatalities caused by eruptions of Etna in historical times reveals that only 77 human deaths are attributable with certainty to eruptions of Etna , most recently in 1987 when two tourists were killed by a sudden explosion near the summit .
