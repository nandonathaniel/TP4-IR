Rene Russo as Frigga : The wife of Odin , queen of Asgard , mother of Thor and adoptive mother of Loki , based on the mythological deity of the same name . Russo said that her role was expanded and explores Frigga 's relationship with Loki , `` You know , they cut me ( down ) in the first film . Kenneth Branagh sent me a nice note , because he understood , he 's an actor . You move on , what are you going to do ? But I think they 're going to need a good mom in the next film . Loki needs his mom . I have a lot of compassion for ( Loki ) . But we might have to have a conversation about what he just did '' .
