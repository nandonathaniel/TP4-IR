Following King Gyanendra 's suspension of Parliament and government takeover during the Nepalese Civil War , mass protests led to him to re-instate Parliament and end the war fought by the government against the Communist Party of Nepal ( Maoist ) , on the condition that the constitution would be re-written . The king 's powers were also removed and an election was held in 2008 to elect a Constituent Assembly . The Constituent Assembly was tasked with writing a new constitution ; however , its deadline was extended several times , with the last one set for 27 May 2012 .
