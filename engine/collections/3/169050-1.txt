Fayol believed by focusing on managerial practices he could minimize misunderstandings and increase efficiency in organizations . He enlightened managers on how to accomplish their managerial duties , and the practices in which they should engage . In his book General and Industrial Management ( published in French in 1916 , then published in English in 1949 ) , Fayol outlined his theory of general management , which he believed could be applied to the administration of myriad industries . His concern was with the administrative apparatus ( or functions of administration ) , and to that end he presented his administrative theory , that is , principles and elements of management .
