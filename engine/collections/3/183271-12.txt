Data integration : Ensures that information in multiple systems is kept consistent . This is also known as enterprise information integration ( EII ) . Vendor independence : Extracts business policies or rules from applications and implements them in the EAI system , so that even if one of the business applications is replaced with a different vendor 's application , the business rules do not have to be re-implemented . Common facade : An EAI system can front - end a cluster of applications , providing a single consistent access interface to these applications and shielding users from having to learn to use different software packages .
