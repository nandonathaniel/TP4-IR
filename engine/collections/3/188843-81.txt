Under the constitution of the Empire of Japan , the Imperial Diet ( Teikoku - gikai ) was a bicameral legislature of two houses generally equal in legislative authority , and while the members of both houses received the same financial compensation -- between 1920 and 1947 : 7500 Yen for the two presidents , ¥ 4500 for the two vice-presidents , ¥ 3000 for all other members of both houses except Imperial princes , dukes and marquesses -- , their status was different by definition : the upper house consisted mainly of hereditary nobles and lifetime - appointed peers , the lower house of elected commoners . In the 1st Imperial Diet in 1890 , there were initially 551 Members of the Imperial Diet ( Teikoku - gikai giin , 帝国 議会 議員 , or in contemporaneous script 帝國 議會 議員 ) : 251 members of the House of Peers ( Kizokuin giin , 貴族 院 議員 ) and 300 members of the House of Representatives ( Shūgiin giin ) ; of the House of Peers members , 10 were members of the Imperial family , 31 were hereditary members from the two upper nobility ranks , 104 were members elected in mutual elections from the three lower nobility ranks , 61 were lifetime - appointed members ( many of these from the bureaucracy ) and 45 were members elected by the 15 top taxpayers in each of the 45 prefectures . But the number of noble and appointed members of the House of Peers was not fixed and varied gradually over time as members died or new peerages were granted ; the number of elected top taxpayer seats , Imperial Academy seats ( introduced in 1925 ) , members appointed from the colonies Chōsen / Korea and Taiwan / Formosa ( introduced in 1945 ) , and the size of the House of Representatives was fixed by law , but was also changed several times over the decades . The last , 92nd Imperial Diet of 1946 -- 47 had 839 members : 466 members of the House of Representatives and 373 members of the House of Peers . As the regulations establishing the cabinet ( naikaku ) and the cabinet 's prime minister ( naikaku sōri - daijin ) were decreed before the Imperial constitution , the prime minister did n't have to be a member of the Imperial Diet , but after the establishment of the Imperial Diet in 1890 , many prime ministers were appointed from the House of Peers , only very few were members of the House of Representatives ( Takashi Hara , Osachi Hamaguchi , Tsuyoshi Inukai ) .
