`` By a bizarre chance , but one that is seen often in the conflicts within revolutions , public opinion had indulgence for the one Director who merited it the least . Barras alone deserved all that was said of the Directory . First of all , he never worked ; he left to his colleagues all the burden of business . He spoke only a decisive moments , when his voice was stronger than his courage . He occupied himself with nothing . He only concerned himself with the personnel of the government , which best suited his genius at intrigue . He took a share of all the profits of the government suppliers , and alone of the Directors deserved the accusation of corruption . Despite all of his faults , he was treated differently than the others , first of all because , unlike the other four , he was not a lawyer ; and despite his laziness , his debauched habits , his bad manners , and his liaisons with the Jacobins , he alone was credited with 18 Fructidor ( the downfall of Robespierre ) , and he gave the appearance of a man of action , more capable of governing than his colleagues ... He was even treacherous toward his colleagues ; because all of the criticism that he deserved himself he skillfully managed to shift exclusively onto them . ''
