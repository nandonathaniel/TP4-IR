Otis Redding recorded a rendition of `` Satisfaction '' for his album Otis Blue / Otis Redding Sings Soul , released in 1965 . Redding claimed that he did not know the lyrics of the song . `` I use a lot of words different than the Stones ' version , '' he noted . `` That 's because I made them up . '' Of that session , Steve Cropper said , `` ... if you ever listened to the record you can hardly understand the lyrics , right ? I set down to a record player and copied down what I thought the lyrics were and I handed Otis a piece of paper and before we got through with the cut , he threw the paper on the floor and that was it . '' Music writer Robert Christgau described it as an `` anarchic reading '' of the Stones ' original . Redding 's soul - style arrangement featured horns playing the main riff , as Keith Richards had originally intended . In 2003 , Ronnie Wood noted that the Rolling Stones ' later concert renditions of the number reflect Redding 's interpretation .
