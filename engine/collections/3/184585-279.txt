The remaining blank cells on the IPA chart can be filled without too much difficulty if the need arises . Some ad hoc letters have appeared in the literature for the retroflex lateral flap , the voiceless lateral fricatives , the epiglottal trill , and the labiodental plosives . ( See the grey letters in the PDF chart . ) Diacritics can supply much of the remainder . If a sound can not be transcribed , an asterisk ⟨ * ⟩ may be used , either as a letter or as a diacritic ( as in ⟨ k * ⟩ sometimes seen for the Korean `` fortis '' velar ) .
