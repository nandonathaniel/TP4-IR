Studies have shown children and adolescents with flat feet are a common occurrence . The human arch develops in infancy and early childhood as part of normal muscle , tendon , ligament and bone growth . Flat arches in children usually become high arches as the child progresses through adolescence and into adulthood . Children with flat feet are at a higher risk of developing knee , hip , and back pain . A recent randomized controlled trial found no evidence for the efficacy of treatment of flat feet in children either from expensive prescribed orthotics i.e ( shoe inserts ) or less expensive over-the - counter orthotics . As a symptom itself , flat feet usually accompany genetic musculoskeletal conditions such as dyspraxia , ligamentous laxity or hypermobility .
