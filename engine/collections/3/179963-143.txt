The UK format did not follow the original Japanese format - instead presenting each sequence of games as comic martial challenges leading to the final game wherein contestants not so far eliminated try to storm Takeshi 's Castle . Each episode in the original run was narrated by Craig Charles , who also coined the term `` Keshi Heads '' to describe avid fans of the show . A typical episode of the UK format of Takeshi 's Castle has about eight games , followed by the final Showdown . After each event , a ' Ridiculous Replay ' is shown , highlighting the most entertaining attempt . Challenge decided to edit out the comedy sketches between Takeshi and Higashi to allow more ( or fewer ) games to be shown during the half - hour block .
