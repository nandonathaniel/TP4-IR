Depending on culture , a wedding ring is typically worn on the base of the left or right ring finger . Many spouses wear their wedding rings day and night , causing an indentation in the skin that is visible even when the ring is removed . Since the 19th century in the West , it has been considered unlucky to remove a wedding ring once it has been placed on the finger in church .
