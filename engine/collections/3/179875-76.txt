M. Shadows of Avenged Sevenfold stated that Iron Maiden `` are by far the best live band in the world and their music is timeless '' , while Trivium singer Matt Heafy comments that `` without Iron Maiden , Trivium surely would n't exist '' . Slipknot and Stone Sour frontman Corey Taylor said that `` Steve Harris does more with four fingers than I 've ever seen anybody do . And Bruce Dickinson ? Dude ! To me , he was the quintessential old - school heavy metal singer . He could hit notes that were just sick , and he was a great showman . Everything made me a fan . And there was n't a dude that I hung out with that was n't trying to draw Eddie on their schoolbooks '' , while their music also helped Jesper Str√∂mblad of In Flames to pioneer the melodic death metal genre , stating that he had wanted to combine death metal with Iron Maiden 's melodic guitar sounds .
