When Khrushchev paid a visit to China in September , shortly after his successful U.S. visit , he met a chilly reception , and Khrushchev left the country on the third day of a planned seven - day visit . Relations continued to deteriorate in 1960 , as both the USSR and China used a Romanian Communist Party congress as an opportunity to attack the other .

Khrushchev responded by pulling Soviet experts out of China .
