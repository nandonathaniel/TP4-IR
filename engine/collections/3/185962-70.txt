The last election was held on 22 February 2013 . Djibouti has a dominant - party system , with the People 's Rally for Progress ( RPP ) controlling the legislature and the executive since its foundation in 1979 ( the party currently rules as a part of the Union for a Presidential Majority , which currently holds a supermajority of seats ) . Opposition parties are allowed ( limited ) freedom , but the main opposition party , the Union for National Salvation , boycotted the 2005 and 2008 elections , citing government control of the media and repression of the opposition candidates .
