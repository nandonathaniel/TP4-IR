In 1974 , author Stephen Cosgrove 's children 's book Wheedle on the Needle imagined a furry creature called a Wheedle who lived on top of the Space Needle and caused its light to flash . Its closing quatrain is : There 's a Wheedle on the Needle / I know just what you 're thinking / But if you look up late at night / You 'll see his red nose blinking . The Wheedle has since become a fixture of Seattle . It even became the mascot of the Seattle SuperSonics National Basketball Association ( NBA ) franchise , who played in nearby KeyArena ( originally known as the Seattle Center Coliseum ) . The SuperSonics moved to Oklahoma City on July 3 , 2008 .
