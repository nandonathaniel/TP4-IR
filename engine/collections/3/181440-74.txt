I know people who cried at the trailer of the romantic teen cancer movie The Fault in Our Stars -- at the movie they 'll need a life preserver to keep from drowning in a flood of tears . Me , I did n't cry , though at times my tear ducts tingled ; I was on the verge . The film is a little slick for my taste , too engineered . But it 's gently directed by Josh Boone and beautifully acted . Whatever the faults , it 's not in the stars .
