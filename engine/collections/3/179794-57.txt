Three promotional materials were filmed in October 2011 and released before the series premiered . The first of these materials , released on January 26 , 2012 , featured Hewitt performing Shirley Bassey 's `` Big Spender '' in a music video - style advert , in reference to the true nature of the work at the massage parlor . The video received much interest from the media due to Hewitt 's risqu√© role , who noted that `` based on this new promo , the show is going to be seriously hot . ''
