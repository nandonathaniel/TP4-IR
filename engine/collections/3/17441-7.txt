In the 18th century , the Swedish scientist Carl Linnaeus classified organisms according to shared physical characteristics , and not simply based upon differences . He established the idea of a taxonomic hierarchy of classification based upon observable characteristics and intended to reflect natural relationships . At the time , however , it was still widely believed that there was no organic connection between species , no matter how similar they appeared . This view was influenced by European scholarly and religious education , which held that the categories of life are dictated by God , forming an Aristotelian hierarchy , the scala naturae or great chain of being . However , whether or not it was supposed to be fixed , the scala ( a ladder ) inherently implied the possibility of climbing .
