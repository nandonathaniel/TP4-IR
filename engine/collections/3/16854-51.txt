The Band -- They were originally known as The Hawks , after their original lead singer Ronnie Hawkins . While working with Bob Dylan in the 1960s , they decided to change their name , but were unable to agree on a new name . They finally decided to simply call themselves `` The Band '' after being derisively referred to as `` the band '' by critics of Dylan 's new electric direction on the 1966 tour .
