In a mission - mode based storyline , Kanpei winds up running into Chousen , who demands that she fight her , in which Chousen would have won except for the fact that Kanpei ( like Ryubi ) has absolutely no control over her dragon , thus snapping and easily defeating a weakened Chousen . After this , she vowed to defeat all the people who stand in between her and her precious Kanu , which brought her to Ryubi , whom she is jealous of because Kanu has admiration ( and legitimate feelings for ) and that Kanpei rarely got noticed by Kanu until she 'd snap . After Kanpei defeated Ryubi , her dragon seemingly woke up and managed to not only defeat Kanpei , but trash the Koumei dojo as well . Only when Kanu sacrificed her well - being for Ryubi did Kanpei realize the fate of the two and their relationship . Though Kanpei left dejected because Kanu wanted to be with Ryubi , she did leave with the satisfaction that Kanu was protected by someone with such a strong resolve and thus drops out of sight .
