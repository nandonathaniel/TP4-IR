As a result of the looming crisis in 1775 the Royal Governor of Virginia , Lord Dunmore , issued a proclamation that promised freedom to servants and slaves who were able to bear arms and join his Loyalist Ethiopian Regiment . Many of the slaves in the South joined the Loyalists with intentions of gaining freedom and escaping the South . About 800 did so ; some helped rout the Virginia militia at the Battle of Kemp 's Landing and fought in the Battle of Great Bridge on the Elizabeth River , wearing the motto `` Liberty to Slaves '' , but this time they were defeated . The remains of their regiment were then involved in the evacuation of Norfolk , after which they served in the Chesapeake area . Eventually the camp that they had set up there suffered an outbreak of smallpox and other diseases . This took a heavy toll , putting many of them out of action for some time . There was a slave by the name of Boston King who joined the Loyalists and wound up catching smallpox . Boston King and other soldiers who were sick were relocated to a different part of the camp so that they did not contaminate the healthy soldiers . The survivors joined other British units and continued to serve throughout the war . Black colonials were often the first to come forward to volunteer and a total of 12,000 African Americans served with the British from 1775 to 1783 . This factor had the effect of forcing the rebels to also offer freedom to those who would serve in the Continental Army ; however , such promises were often reneged upon by both sides .
