Twins are two offspring produced by the same pregnancy . Twins can be either monozygotic ( `` identical '' ) , meaning that they develop from one zygote , which splits and forms two embryos , or dizygotic ( `` fraternal '' ) , meaning that they develop from two different eggs . In fraternal twins , each twin is fertilized by its own sperm cell .
