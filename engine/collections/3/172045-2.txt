A special economic zone ( SEZ ) is an area in which business and trade laws are different from the rest of the country . SEZs are located within a country 's national borders , and their aims include : increased trade , increased investment , job creation and effective administration . To encourage businesses to set up in the zone , financial policies are introduced . These policies typically regard investing , taxation , trading , quotas , customs and labour regulations . Additionally , companies may be offered tax holidays , where upon establishing in a zone they are granted a period of lower taxation .
