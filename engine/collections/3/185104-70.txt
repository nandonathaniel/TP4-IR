South Dallas , a distinct neighborhood southeast of Downtown , lays claim to the Cedars , an eclectic artist hotbed , and Fair Park , home of the annual State Fair of Texas , held in late September and through mid-October . Southwest of Downtown lies Oak Cliff , a hilly area that has undergone gentrification in recent years , in neighborhoods such as the Bishop Arts District . Oak Cliff was a township founded in the mid-1800s and annexed in 1903 by the city of Dallas . Today , most of the area 's northern residents are Hispanic . The ghost town of La Reunion once occupied the northern tip of Oak Cliff . South Oak Cliff has a population that is a mixture of African American , Hispanic , and Native American .
