... he was of fine size and figure - lofty in his carriage , and built for strength and activity ; remarkably muscular and broad across the hips and breast ; head large , but not out of proportion ; muzzle rather longer than is common with that race of dogs ; his colour a dingy red , with some white on the face and breast ; his coat short and smooth , but uncommonly thick , and more like a coarse fur than hair ; tail full , with long hair , and always carried very high . His eyes were very peculiar : they were so light as to have almost an unnatural appearance , something resembling what is termed a wail eye , in a horse ; and it is remarkable , that in a visit which I made to the Eastern Shore , nearly twenty years after he was sent there , in a sloop which had been sent expressly for him , to West River , by Governor Lloyd , I saw many of his descendants who were marked with this peculiarity .
