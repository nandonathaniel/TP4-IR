`` If it be said that the legislative body are themselves the constitutional judges of their own powers , and that the construction they put upon them is conclusive upon the other departments , it may be answered , that this can not be the natural presumption , where it is not to be collected from any particular provisions in the Constitution . It is not otherwise to be supposed , that the Constitution could intend to enable the representatives of the people to substitute their will to that of their constituents . It is far more rational to suppose , that the courts were designed to be an intermediate body between the people and the legislature , in order , among other things , to keep the latter within the limits assigned to their authority .
