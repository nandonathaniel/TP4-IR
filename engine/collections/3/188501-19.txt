The neutrinos emitted in beta decay will have a spectrum of energy ranges , because although momentum is conserved , the momentum can be shared in any way between the positron and neutrino , with either emitted at rest and the other taking away the full energy , or anything in between , so long as all the energy from the Q - value is used . The total momentum received by the electron and the neutrino is not great enough to cause a significant recoil of the much heavier daughter nucleus and hence , its contribution to kinetic energy of the products , for the precision of values given here , can be neglected . Thus the neutrino emitted during the decay of nitrogen - 13 can have an energy from zero up to 1.20 MeV , and the neutrino emitted during the decay of oxygen - 15 can have an energy from zero up to 1.73 MeV . On average , about 1.7 MeV of the total energy output is taken away by neutrinos for each loop of the cycle , leaving about 25 MeV available for producing luminosity .
