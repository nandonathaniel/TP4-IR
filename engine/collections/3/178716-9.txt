In 1872 Act III , 1872 was enacted but later it was found inadequate for certain desired reforms , and Parliament enacted a new legislation . Henry Sumner Maine first introduced Act III of 1872 , which would permit any dissenters to marry whomever they chose under a new civil marriage law . In the final wording , the law sought to legitimize marriages for those willing to renounce their profession of faith altogether ( `` I do not profess the Hindu , Christian , Jewish , etc. religion '' ) . It can apply in inter-caste and inter-religion marriages . Overall , the response from local governments and administrators was that they were unanimously opposed to Maine 's Bill and believed the legislation encouraged marriages based on lust , which would inevitably lead to immorality .
