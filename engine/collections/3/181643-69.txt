The Italian Renaissance is best known for its achievements in painting , architecture , sculpture , literature , music , philosophy , science and exploration . Italy became the recognized European leader in all these areas by the late 15th century , during the Peace of Lodi ( 1454 - 1494 ) agreed between Italian states . The Italian Renaissance peaked in the mid-16th century as domestic disputes and foreign invasions plunged the region into the turmoil of the Italian Wars ( 1494 - 1559 ) . Following this conflict , the smaller Italian states lost their independence and entered a period known as `` foreign domination '' . However , the ideas and ideals of the Italian Renaissance endured and spread into the rest of Europe , setting off the Northern Renaissance . Italian explorers from the maritime republics served under the auspices of European monarchs , ushering the Age of discovery . The most famous among them are Cristopher Columbus who served for Spain , Giovanni da Verrazzano for France , Amerigo Vespucci for Portugal , and John Cabot for England . Italian universities attracted polymaths and scholars such as Copernicus , Vesalius , Galileo and Torricelli , playing a key role in the scientific revolution . Various events and dates have been proposed for the end of the Renaissance , often occurring during the 17th century .
