While John 's Gospel emphasizes Jesus as the Son of God , the Gospel of Luke depicts him as a prophet above all else , attributing that title to Jesus more often than even Mark . A prophet is not someone who merely preaches , but claims divine revelation through God . In Luke 4 : 24 following his hometown rejection episode , Jesus remarks that as a prophet he is not welcome in his own hometown . Elsewhere , in Luke 7 : 39 the Jews again doubt that Jesus is a prophet . The view of Jesus as a prophet is used in the concept of threefold office which sees his 3 roles as `` Prophet , Priest and King '' . While during early Christianity there were people claiming to be prophets , there are no records of anyone else claiming to be a prophet during the life of Jesus .
