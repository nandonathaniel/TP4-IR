In September 2014 , IRS Commissioner John Koskinen expressed concern over the organization 's ability to handle Obamacare and administer premium tax credits that help people pay for health plans from the health law 's insurance exchanges . It will also enforce the law 's individual mandate , which requires most Americans to hold health insurance . In January 2015 , Fox News obtained an email which predicted a messy tax season on several fronts . The email was sent by IRS Commissioner Koskinen to workers . Koskinen predicted the IRS would shut down operations for two days later this year which would result in unpaid furloughs for employees and service cuts for taxpayers . Koskinen also said delays to IT investments of more than $200 million may delay new taxpayer protections against identity theft . Also in January 2015 , the editorial board of The New York Times called the IRS budget cuts penny-wise - and - pound - foolish , where for every dollar of cuts in the budget , $6 were lost in tax revenue .
