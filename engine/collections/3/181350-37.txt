By the mid-1970s , there was a shortage in drivers , and as many as one - fifth of taxicabs were in the garage at any given time . Drivers only needed to take a test to show proof that they understood English ; demonstrate knowledge of 29 major corridors and 168 routes to popular landmarks ; and be able to point out the locations of ten to fifteen landmarks , using a geographical directory provided during the test . Despite the fact that many potential applicants did not know locations outside Manhattan well , almost all applicants passed the test . By 1975 , although the TLC was issuing 40,000 licenses yearly , there was a high proportion of new drivers : less than one - third of the 40,000 licenses were those being renewed by cab drivers who were already working , while two - thirds of the licenses were issued to new drivers .
