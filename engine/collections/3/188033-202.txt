Third , he was charged selecting and guiding the generals . In June 1776 , Congress made its first attempt at running the war effort with the committee known as `` Board of War and Ordnance '' , succeeded by the Board of War in July 1777 , a committee which eventually included members of the military . The command structure of the armed forces was a hodgepodge of Congressional appointees ( and Congress sometimes made those appointments without Washington 's input ) with state - appointments filling the lower ranks . The results of his general staff were mixed , as some of his favorites never mastered the art of command , such as John Sullivan . Eventually , he found capable officers such as Nathanael Greene , Daniel Morgan , Henry Knox ( chief of artillery ) , and Alexander Hamilton ( chief of staff ) . The American officers never equaled their opponents in tactics and maneuver , and they lost most of the pitched battles . The great successes at Boston ( 1776 ) , Saratoga ( 1777 ) , and Yorktown ( 1781 ) came from trapping the British far from base with much larger numbers of troops .
