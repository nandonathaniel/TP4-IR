Most of Sindh 's prosperous middle class at the time of Partition was Hindu . At the time of Partition there were 1,400,000 Hindu Sindhis , though most were concentrated in cities such as Hyderabad , Karachi , Shikarpur , and Sukkur . Hundreds of Hindus residing in Sindh were forced to migrate . Some anti-Hindu violence in Sindh was precipitated by the arrival of Muslim refugees from India with minimal local Muslim support for the rioters . Sindhi Hindus faced low scale rioting unlike the Punjabi Hindus and Sikhs who had to migrate from West Punjab .
