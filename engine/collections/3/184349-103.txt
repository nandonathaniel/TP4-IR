By this time Sun had become convinced that the only hope for a unified China lay in a military conquest from his base in the south , followed by a period of political tutelage that would culminate in the transition to democracy . In order to hasten the conquest of China , he began a policy of active cooperation with the Communist Party of China ( CPC ) . Sun and the Soviet Union 's Adolph Joffe signed the Sun - Joffe Manifesto in January 1923 . Sun received help from the Comintern for his acceptance of communist members into his KMT . Revolutionary and socialist leader Vladimir Lenin praised Sun and the KMT for their ideology and principles . Lenin praised Sun and his attempts at social reformation , and also congratulated him for fighting foreign Imperialism . Sun also returned the praise , calling him a `` great man '' , and sent his congratulations on the revolution in Russia .
