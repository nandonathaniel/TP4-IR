Students seek relief from rising prices through the purchase of used copies of textbooks , which tend to be less expensive . Most college bookstores offer used copies of textbooks at lower prices . Most bookstores will also buy used copies back from students at the end of a term if the book is going to be re-used at the school . Books that are not being re-used at the school are often purchased by an off - campus wholesaler for 0 - 30 % of the new cost , for distribution to other bookstores where the books will be sold . Textbook companies have countered this by encouraging faculty to assign homework that must be done on the publisher 's website . If a student has a new textbook , then he or she can use the pass code in the book to register on the site . If the student has purchased a used textbook , then he or she must pay money directly to the publisher in order to access the website and complete assigned homework .
