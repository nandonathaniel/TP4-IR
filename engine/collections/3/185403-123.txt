`` This law of nature , being co-eval with mankind and dictated by God himself , is of course superior in obligation to any other . It is binding over all the globe , in all countries , and at all times : no human laws are of any validity , if contrary to this ; and such of them as are valid derive all their force , and all their authority , mediately or immediately , from this original .
