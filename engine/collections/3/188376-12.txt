The Joker kills Lau and the Chechen , burns his half of the mob 's money , and takes over the Chechen 's gang . Then , to prevent Wayne Enterprises M&A law accountant Coleman Reese ( Joshua Harto ) from revealing Batman 's alter ego on TV , he announces that he will blow up a hospital if Reese is not dead within 60 minutes . During the panic , the Joker sneaks into Gotham General Hospital disguised as a nurse to meet with Dent , and persuades him to take revenge on the people he holds responsible for Rachel 's death . He then blows up the hospital and takes a busload of hostages . He rigs explosives on two of the ferries separately containing citizens and criminals and tells the passengers that he will destroy both boats unless one blows up the other . Ultimately , however , the hostages choose not to blow each other up . Batman subsequently apprehends the Joker , who states that neither will kill each other and believes that they are meant to fight each other forever . The Joker gloats that he has won `` the battle for Gotham 's soul '' , as the city 's inhabitants will lose hope once Dent 's rampage as the murderous vigilante `` Two - Face '' become known . The Joker is then taken into custody as he laughs hysterically . Batman ultimately foils the Joker 's plan by taking the blame for Dent 's crimes .
