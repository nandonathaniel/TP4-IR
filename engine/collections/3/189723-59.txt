The Coliseum was problematic as an NFL venue . At various times in its history , it was either the largest or one of the largest stadiums in the NFL , making it difficult to sell out . Since the NFL 's blackout rule barred games from being televised locally unless they were sold out 72 hours before kickoff , this meant Rams ( and later Raiders ) games were often blacked out in Southern California .
