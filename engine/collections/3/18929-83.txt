In a measure that garnered substantial popular support for his New Deal , Roosevelt moved to put to rest one of the most divisive cultural issues of the 1920s . He signed the bill to legalize the manufacture and sale of alcohol , an interim measure pending the repeal of prohibition , for which a constitutional amendment of repeal ( the 21st ) was already in process . The repeal amendment was ratified later in 1933 . States and cities gained additional new revenue and Roosevelt secured his popularity especially in the cities and ethnic areas by helping the beer start flowing .
