The Oslo Accords are based on the 1978 Camp David Accords and show therefore considerable similarity with those Accords . The Camp David 's `` Framework for Peace in the Middle East '' envisioned autonomy for the local , and only for the local , ( Palestinian ) inhabitants of West Bank and Gaza . At the time , there lived some 7,400 settlers in the West Bank ( excluding East Jerusalem ) , and 500 in Gaza , with the number in the West Bank , however , rapidly growing . As Israel regarded the PLO a terrorist organisation , it refused to talk with the sole representative of the Palestinian people . Instead , Israel preferred to negotiate with Egypt and Jordan , and `` elected representatives of the inhabitants of the West Bank and Gaza '' .
