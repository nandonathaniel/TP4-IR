Some macronyms can be multiply nested : the second - order acronym points to another one further down a hierarchy . In an informal competition run by the magazine New Scientist , a fully documented specimen was discovered that may be the most deeply nested of all : RARS is the `` Regional ATOVS Retransmission Service '' ; ATOVS is `` Advanced TOVS '' ; TOVS is `` TIROS operational vertical sounder '' ; and TIROS is `` Television infrared observational satellite '' . Fully expanded , `` RARS '' might thus become `` Regional Advanced Television Infrared Observational Satellite Operational Vertical Sounder Retransmission Service '' . However , to say that `` RARS '' stands directly for that string of words , or can be interchanged with it in syntax ( in the same way that `` CHF '' can be usefully interchanged with `` congestive heart failure '' ) , is a prescriptive misapprehension rather than a linguistically accurate description ; the true nature of such a term is closer to anacronymic than to being interchangeable like simpler acronyms are . The latter are fully reducible in an attempt to `` spell everything out and avoid all abbreviations , '' but the former are irreducible in that respect ; they can be annotated with parenthetical explanations , but they can not be eliminated from speech or writing in any useful or practical way . Just as the words laser and radar function as words in syntax and cognition without a need to focus on their acronymic origins , terms such as `` RARS '' and `` CHA2DS2 -- VASc score '' are irreducible in natural language ; if they are purged , the form of language that is left may conform to some imposed rule , but it can not be described as remaining natural . Similarly , protein and gene nomenclature , which uses symbols extensively , includes such terms as the name of the NACHT protein domain , which reflects the symbols of some proteins that contain the domain -- NAIP ( NLR family apoptosis inhibitor protein ) , C2TA ( major histocompatibility complex class II transcription activator ) , HET - E ( incompatibility locus protein from Podospora anserine ) , and TP1 ( telomerase - associated protein ) -- but is not syntactically reducible to them . The name is thus itself more symbol than acronym , and its expansion can not replace it while preserving its function in natural syntax as a name within a clause clearly parsable by human readers or listeners .
