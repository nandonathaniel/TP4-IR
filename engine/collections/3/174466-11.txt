A central bank can also use a mixture of policy settings that change depending on circumstances . A central bank may peg its exchange rate ( like a currency board ) with different levels or forms of commitment . The looser the exchange rate peg , the more latitude the central bank has to target other variables ( such as interest rates ) . It may instead target a basket of foreign currencies rather than a single currency . In some instances it is empowered to use additional means other than open market operations , such as changes in reserve requirements or capital controls , to achieve monetary outcomes .
