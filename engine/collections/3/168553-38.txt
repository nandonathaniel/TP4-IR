The Scallions ( introduced 1993 ) are a trio of often devious green onions who are led by their tallest member ( simply called Scallion # 1 ) . Along with Mr. Nezzer and Mr. Lunt , the Scallions are among the most consistent antagonists in VeggieTales . They debuted as The Wisemen opposite Larry 's `` Daniel '' in the second act of the video Where 's God When I 'm S - Scared ? ( Daniel in the Lions ' Den ) and later appeared in Are You My Neighbor ? as a trio of bandits that hold - up Larry in `` The Story of Flibber - O - Loo '' . In the Silly Songs `` The Yodeling Veterinarian Of The Alps '' , `` Listen '' , and `` A Helping Hand '' , they ( along with Frankencelery ) perform as a barbershop quartet that narrates the songs . Occasionally , one of The Scallions will make a solo appearance : Scallion # 1 appeared as a salesman to sell his new `` Forgive - O - Matic '' device in God Wants Me to Forgive Them ! ? ! , and Scallion # 3 appeared as the Milk Money Bandit of Bumblyburg in LarryBoy and the Rumor Weed . None of the Scallions have actual names , which Scallion # 1 laments at the end of the Silly Song `` High Silk Hat '' from Lyle the Kindly Viking ( `` I 've been around since show one and I still do n't have a name '' ) .
