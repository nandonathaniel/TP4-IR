According to a 2004 survey , two - thirds of Germany 's citizens have at least basic knowledge of English . About 20 % consider themselves to be competent speakers of French , followed by speakers of Russian ( 7 % ) , Italian ( 6.1 % ) , and Spanish ( 5.6 % ) . The relatively high number of Russian speakers is a result of massive immigration from the former Soviet Union to Germany for almost 10 consecutive years , plus its having been learned in school by many older former East Germans .
