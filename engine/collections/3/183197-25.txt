Owners of rental properties may also be held liable if they knew an aggressive dog was living on their property and they did nothing to ensure the safety of other tenants at the property ; as a result , many rental properties forbid pit bull - type dogs and any other breeds if the rental property 's insurance will not cover damage inflicted by that type of dog . The dog breeds most often targeted by insurance companies include pit bull - type dogs , Rottweilers , German Shepherd Dogs , Doberman Pinschers , Akitas ( Akita Inu and American Akita ) , and Chow Chows .
