There are hypotheses that are in direct conflict to the RNA world hypothesis . The relative chemical complexity of the nucleotide and the unlikelihood of it spontaneously arising , along with the limited number of combinations possible among four base forms , as well as the need for RNA polymers of some length before seeing enzymatic activity , have led some to reject the RNA world hypothesis in favor of a metabolism - first hypothesis , where the chemistry underlying cellular function arose first , along with the ability to replicate and facilitate this metabolism .
