Eventually the 12 - inch ( 300 mm ) ​ 33 ⁄ rpm LP prevailed as the dominant format for musical albums , and 10 - inch LPs were no longer issued . The last Columbia Records reissue of any Frank Sinatra songs on a 10 - inch LP record was an album called Hall of Fame , CL 2600 , issued on October 26 , 1956 , containing six songs , one each by Tony Bennett , Rosemary Clooney , Johnnie Ray , Frank Sinatra , Doris Day , and Frankie Laine . The 10 - inch LP had a longer life in the United Kingdom , where important early British rock and roll albums such as Lonnie Donegan 's Lonnie Donegan Showcase and Billy Fury 's The Sound of Fury were released in that form . The 7 - inch ( 175 mm ) 45 rpm disc or `` single '' established a significant niche for shorter duration discs , typically containing one item on each side . The 45 rpm discs typically emulated the playing time of the former 78 rpm discs , while the 12 - inch LP discs eventually provided up to one half - hour of recorded material per side .
