The MBE is currently required in all jurisdictions except Louisiana and Puerto Rico . The most recent state to adopt the MBE was Washington , which began using the MBE when it adopted the UBE in July 2013 . In jurisdictions that do not use the MPRE , candidates must pass a professional responsibility ( `` ethics '' ) exam included as part of the main bar exam . Some states , such as Michigan , employ the MPRE and include ethics questions in their main exam . State - specific content is usually included in the examination , such as essays in Washington , Minnesota and Massachusetts . Some states , such as Florida , include both essays and multiple - choice questions in their state - specific sections ; Virginia uses full essays and short - answer questions in its state - specific section .
