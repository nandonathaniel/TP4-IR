In March 1942 , the U.S. first noticed mention of the MO operation in intercepted messages . On 5 April , the Americans intercepted an IJN message directing a carrier and other large warships to proceed to Inoue 's area of operations . On 13 April , the British deciphered an IJN message informing Inoue that the Fifth Carrier Division , consisting of the fleet carriers Sh≈çkaku and Zuikaku , was en route to his command from Formosa via the main IJN base at Truk . The British passed the message to the Americans , along with their conclusion that Port Moresby was the likely target of MO .
