Brazil was the most popular South American destination for Australian travellers , with more than 60,000 people flying between the two countries in 2007 . As a result , in 2008 , the Australian Government agreed to new aviation agreements which meant airlines in Brazil and Australia will have their entitlements doubled to 14 weekly passenger flights and seven freight services . Transport Minister Anthony Albanese said `` The removal of most restrictions on air routes between Australia and Brazil will , over time , provide more choice for travellers ... and allow our airlines to take advantage of the rapidly growing economies of South America .
