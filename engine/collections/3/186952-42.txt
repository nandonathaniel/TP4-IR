The second theory uses grip placement and angle as the primary factor in targeting each head . For instance , to target the long head when using dumbbells or cables , the grip should be semi-supinated ( hammer ) grip where the palms face each other . If using a barbell ( EZ grip or straight ) , the grip should be inside of shoulder width . To target the short head when using dumbbells or cables , grip should be supinated , where the palms are facing up completely . If using a barbell ( EZ grip or straight ) , grip should be outside of shoulder width .
