In some of his unpublished early work , Tolkien appears to distinguish orcs from goblins . By the time of his published work , however , the terms had become synonymous . The Hobbit generally uses the term goblin , while The Lord of the Rings prefers orc . The opponents of the dwarves in `` Dwarf and Goblin War '' of The Hobbit are described as orcs in Appendix A of The Lord of the Rings . No distinction is made by size ; large orcs , including the Uruk - hai , are just as much goblins as are smaller ones .
