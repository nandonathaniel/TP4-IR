The music was written by composer Ennio Morricone , Leone 's regular collaborator , who wrote the score under Leone 's direction before filming began . As in The Good , the Bad and the Ugly , the haunting music contributes to the film 's grandeur and , like the music for The Good , the Bad and the Ugly , is considered one of Morricone 's greatest compositions .
