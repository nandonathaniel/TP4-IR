From 18 : 30 to 18 : 45 , each of the three bomber squadrons attacked in a formation of three Ju 52s abreast -- an attack front of about 150 m ( 490 ft ) . At the same time , and continuing for around 15 minutes after the bombing wave , the Bf 109Bs and Heinkel He 51 biplanes strafed the roads leading out of town , adding to civilian casualties .
