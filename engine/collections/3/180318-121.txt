The Naʼvi language currently has over 2,000 words . These include a few English loan words such as kunsìp `` gunship '' . The published lexicon , including the odd inflectional form , is available online at https://eanaeltu.learnnavi.org/dicts/NaviDictionary.pdf . Additionally , the community at learnnavi.org is working with Dr. Frommer to further develop the language . Naʼvi is a very modular language and the total number of usable words far exceeds the 2,000 dictionary words . For example : rol `` to sing '' → tìrusol `` the act of singing '' or ngop `` to create '' → ngopyu `` creator '' . Workarounds using existing words also abound in the Naʼvi corpus , such as eltu lefngap `` metallic brain '' for `` computer '' and palulukantsyìp `` little thanator '' for `` cat '' .
