The Triple Entente ( from French entente ( ɑ̃tɑ̃t ) `` friendship , understanding , agreement '' ) refers to the understanding linking the Russian Empire , the French Third Republic , and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland after the signing of the Anglo - Russian Entente on 31 August 1907 . The understanding between the three powers , supplemented by agreements with Japan and Portugal , was a powerful counterweight to the Triple Alliance of Germany , Austria - Hungary , and Italy .
