A 2004 review reported 46 % of bites occurring on distal extremities of the limbs , 25 % on proximal areas of limbs ( upper arms and thighs ) , 21 % on the trunk , and 7 % on the head or neck . In some cases the same spider bites a victim multiple times . Historically , victims were often bitten on the genitalia , though this phenomenon disappeared as outhouses were superseded by plumbed indoor toilets . Conversely , bites on the head and neck have increased with use of safety helmets and ear muffs . Precautions to avoid being bitten include wearing gloves and shoes while gardening , not leaving clothes on the floor , and shaking out gloves or shoes before putting them on . Also , children can be educated not to touch spiders .
