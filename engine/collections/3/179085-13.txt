During the development of the early manga chapters , Obata feared L would appear `` so suspicious that Light would know instantly it was L if they ever met '' . When Obata 's editor told him that he wanted L to have a face `` looking cool based on the angle '' , Obata added black bags under L 's eyes . Obata cited Devilman 's Akira Fudou when stating that he believed that black bags were appealing . In addition , Obata thought of a `` dead eyes '' concept , which involved L having `` all - black eyes '' and `` mostly no eyebrows '' . Obata believes that black eyes usually makes a character goofier , but the bags `` sharpen the character 's gaze '' . Obata believes that the design evokes `` a feeling of mystery '' and that the reader can not determine L 's true thoughts . Obata also said that the bags under L 's eyes were useful for inspiring speculation about his lifestyle and background . The outfit Obata designed for L was a `` simple '' white , long - sleeved shirt and jeans , to convey that L does not put thought into choosing his clothing . In Death Note 13 : How to Read , Ohba presented an initial rough draft of L and said that , with a `` cool expression '' and without the bags under his eyes , L looked like a different person .
