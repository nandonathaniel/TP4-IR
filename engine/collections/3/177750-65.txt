While Major General George B. McClellan 's 87,000 - man Army of the Potomac was moving to intercept Lee , a Union soldier discovered a mislaid copy of the detailed battle plans of Lee 's army , on Sunday 14 September . The order indicated that Lee had divided his army and dispersed portions geographically ( to Harpers Ferry , West Virginia , and Hagerstown , Maryland ) , thus making each subject to isolation and defeat in detail - if McClellan could move quickly enough . However , McClellan waited about 18 hours before deciding to take advantage of this intelligence and position his forces based on it , thus endangering a golden opportunity to defeat Lee decisively .
