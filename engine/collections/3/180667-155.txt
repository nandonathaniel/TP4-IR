Some of these critics claim that Shiloh was won when Johnston fell , and that if he had not fallen the army under me would have been annihilated or captured . Ifs defeated the Confederates at Shiloh . There is little doubt that we would have been disgracefully beaten if all the shells and bullets fired by us had passed harmlessly over the enemy and if all of theirs had taken effect . Commanding generals are liable to be killed during engagements ; and the fact that when he was shot Johnston was leading a brigade to induce it to make a charge which had been repeatedly ordered , is evidence that there was neither the universal demoralization on our side nor the unbounded confidence on theirs which has been claimed . There was , in fact , no hour during the day when I doubted the eventual defeat of the enemy , although I was disappointed that reinforcements so near at hand did not arrive at an earlier hour .
