With Voldemort vanquished after failing to kill Harry , the Death Eaters largely disbanded . The Ministry rounded many of them up and imprisoned them in the Wizarding prison Azkaban , but some eluded justice by claiming they were bewitched by the Imperius Curse ( it is implied that Lucius Malfoy did so ) or by turning in other Death Eaters , as Igor Karkaroff did ; Harry witnesses Karkaroff 's testimony against former Death Eaters in Albus Dumbledore 's Pensieve during the course of the series . It appears that very few Death Eaters stood for their fallen master and proudly went to Azkaban for him ( like Bellatrix Lestrange ) , since , in the sixth book , Snape states that if Voldemort had refused to welcome back all those who turned their backs on him when he fell , then he would have very few followers . The Lestranges are the only Death Eaters known to have willingly sacrificed their freedom for Voldemort . This is something that does not go unnoticed by him , as he claims , when he returns , that they will be rewarded above all others for their loyalty .
