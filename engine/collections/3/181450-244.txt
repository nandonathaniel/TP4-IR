The history of the Seven Years ' War in North America , particularly the expulsion of the Acadians , the siege of Quebec , the death of Wolfe , and the Battle of Fort William Henry generated a vast number of ballads , broadsides , images , and novels ( see Longfellow 's Evangeline , Benjamin West 's The Death of General Wolfe , James Fenimore Cooper 's The Last of the Mohicans ) , maps and other printed materials , which testify to how this event held the imagination of the British and North American public long after Wolfe 's death in 1759 .
