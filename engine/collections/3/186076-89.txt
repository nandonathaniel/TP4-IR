Episode VII would begin roughly 20 ( or perhaps 30 -- 40 ) years after the end of Return of the Jedi ( according to Lucas in 1980 and 1982 ) . R2 - D2 and C - 3PO would be the only characters who might continue through all nine films ( Lucas in 1980 , 1981 and 1983 ) . The trilogy would deal with the rebuilding of the Republic ( Lucas in 1980 ) . `` It 's like a saga , the story of a group of people , a family '' ( Lucas in 1980 ) . Luke would have a romantic relationship with a female love interest ( Lucas in 1988 ) . The main theme of the trilogy would be moral and philosophical problems , such as the necessity for moral choices and the wisdom needed to distinguish right from wrong , justice , confrontation , and passing on what you have learned ( Lucas in 1983 and 1989 ) . The key actors , Hamill as Luke Skywalker , Ford as Han Solo , and Fisher as Princess Leia , would appear , in their 60s or 70s ( Lucas in 1983 ) . In Episode IX , Hamill would cameo , `` like Obi - Wan handing the lightsaber down to the next new hope '' ( according to Hamill , in 2004 ) . `` The other one -- what happens to Luke afterward -- is much more ethereal . I have a tiny notebook full of notes on that . If I 'm really ambitious , I could proceed to figure out what would have happened to Luke '' ( Lucas in 1980 ) .
