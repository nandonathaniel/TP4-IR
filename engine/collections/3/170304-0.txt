Samoset ( also Somerset , c. 1590 -- 1653 ) was an Abenaki sagamore and the first American Indian to make contact with the Pilgrims of Plymouth Colony . He startled the colonists on March 16 , 1621 by walking into Plymouth Colony and greeting them in English , which he had begun to learn from fishermen frequenting the waters of Maine .
