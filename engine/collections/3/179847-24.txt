Mrs. Montague and Mr. Capulet ( Julie Walters and Richard Wilson ) are two elderly neighbours who despise each other . When they leave their respective gardens , their garden gnomes and other lawn ornaments come alive . The Montague garden is filled with blue - hat gnomes led by Lady Bluebury ( Maggie Smith ) , and the Capulet garden has red - hat gnomes led by Lord Redbrick ( Michael Caine ) . Like their human gardeners , the gnomes also despise each other .
