A 2013 study found a pronounced relationship between economic inequality and life expectancy . However , a study by Jos√© A. Tapia Granados and Ana Diez Roux at the University of Michigan found that life expectancy actually increased during the Great Depression , and during recessions and depressions in general . The authors suggest that when people are working extra hard during good economic times , they undergo more stress , exposure to pollution , and likelihood of injury among other longevity - limiting factors .
