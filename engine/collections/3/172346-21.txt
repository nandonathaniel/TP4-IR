The eurobarometer poll does not take adoption timing issues into concern , meaning that this result can not be directly compared to the above results of the TNS Polska surveys , as a percentage of those being surveyed might respond with a more negative bias ( assuming the survey question is about if they favour adoption now '' rather than favour `` adoption either now or at a later point of time perceived as being more optimal for their country '' ) .
