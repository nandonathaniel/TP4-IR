In 2002 , Walgreens senior vice president of supply chain and logistics Randy Lewis began a program aimed at providing opportunity to the disabled to work side by side with typical workers . The result was the development and opening of two distribution centers whose staff is approximately 40 % disabled . The model was so successful that other companies such as Clarks Companies NA , Glaxo Smith Kline , Best Buy , and Costco have either examined it or placed it under consideration .
