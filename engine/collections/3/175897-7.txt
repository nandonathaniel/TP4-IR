Some people 's bodies may take more time than others to be able to balance the amount of oxygen they need to counteract the lactic acid . This theory of the second wind posits that , by pushing past the point of pain and exhaustion , runners may give their systems enough time to warm up and begin to use the oxygen to its fullest potential . For this reason , well - conditioned Olympic - level runners do not generally experience a second wind ( or they experience it much sooner ) because their bodies are trained to perform properly from the start of the race .
