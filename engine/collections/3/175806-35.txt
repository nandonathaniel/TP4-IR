The Daughters of the Republic of Texas ( DRT ) formed in 1895 and began trying to preserve the Alamo . Adina Emilia De Zavala and Clara Driscoll successfully convinced the state legislature in 1905 to purchase the remaining buildings and to name the DRT as the permanent custodian of the site . Over the next century , periodic attempts were made to transfer control of the Alamo from the DRT . In early 2015 , Texas Land Commissioner George P. Bush officially removed control of the Alamo to the Texas General Land Office .
