Qin Shi Huang also improved the strong military , despite the fact that it had already undergone extensive reforms . The military used the most advanced weaponry of the time . The invention of the sword during the Warring States period was a great advance . It was first used mostly in bronze form , but by the third century BC , the Qin were using stronger iron swords . The demand for this metal resulted in improved bellows . The crossbow had been introduced in the fifth century BC and was more powerful and accurate than the composite bows used earlier . It could also be rendered ineffective by removing two pins , which prevented enemies from capturing a working crossbow .
