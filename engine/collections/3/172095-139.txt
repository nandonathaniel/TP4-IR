By August 16 , power was fully restored in New York and Toronto . Toronto 's subway and streetcars remained out of service until August 18 to prevent the possibility of equipment being stuck in awkward locations if the power was interrupted again . Power had been mostly restored in Ottawa , though authorities warned of possible additional disruptions and advised conservation as power continued to be restored to other areas . Ontarians were asked to reduce their electricity use by 50 % until all generating stations could be brought back on line . Four remained out of service on the 19th . Illuminated billboards were largely dormant for the week following the blackout , and many stores had only a portion of their lights on .
