Star 's parents send a fairy godmother named Baby to evaluate Star , who takes the task seriously , as failing the eval would mean she would have to return to Mewni . At first , Star cleans up her room , shoving stuff in closets or dimensional pockets , but when Baby starts asking Star questions , and things start falling out of the pockets , Star 's responses are met with the same neutral phrase `` Interesting . '' followed by jotting down of notes . Meanwhile Marco tries to help Star by bringing Baby food . Baby then asks Star to bring her an apple using magic , but Star fails to do the task despite repeated tries . Baby concludes that Star failed , but Star tries one last time and ends up using the apple seeds to grow an apple tree which drops an apple for Baby . Star 's parents learn from Baby that despite not being organized , losing the book of spells , and failing to do simple spells , Star has magic potential way ahead of when her mother was her age , and might even be comparable to Queen Eclipsa .
