Developmental stages began for the film midway through the series ' first season production in January 1998 . Co-creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone signed a deal with Comedy Central in April 1998 that contracted the duo to producing South Park episodes until 1999 , gave them a slice of the lucrative spinoff merchandising the show generated within its first year , as well as an unspecified seven - figure cash bonus to bring the show to the big screen , in theaters . A large part of Parker and Stone 's conditions attached to any potential movie project was that it must at least be R - rated , to keep in touch with the series ' humor and its roots , the short The Spirit of Christmas . Parker stated that their desire was to approach the film from a much more creative perspective and do something other than a simple movie - length version of a regular episode . Despite alleged pressure from Paramount Pictures officials to keep the movie toned down , the two won the battle for a more mature rating . `` They really wanted to be able to go beyond the South Park television show , '' said Comedy Central spokesman Tony Fox to TV Guide at the time . `` They really fought hard for and won the right to make an R - rated movie . '' Paramount executives went as far to prepare graphs displaying how much more money a PG - 13 - rated South Park feature would perhaps accumulate . The William Morris Agency , which represented Parker and Stone , pushed for movie production to begin as soon as possible , while public interest was still high , instead of several years into its run , as was done with Beavis and Butt - head Do America , possibly because Beavis and Butt - head and South Park were owned by Viacom Global Entertainment Group , a unit of the Viacom Media Networks division of Viacom after Doug Herzog left Viacom Media Networks on January 12 , 2017 .
