In the On Demonstration section of The Book of Healing ( 1027 ) , the Persian philosopher and scientist Avicenna ( Ibn Sina ) discussed philosophy of science and described an early scientific method of inquiry . He discussed Aristotle 's Posterior Analytics and significantly diverged from it on several points . Avicenna discussed the issue of a proper procedure for scientific inquiry and the question of `` How does one acquire the first principles of a science ? '' He asked how a scientist might find `` the initial axioms or hypotheses of a deductive science without inferring them from some more basic premises ? '' He explained that the ideal situation is when one grasps that a `` relation holds between the terms , which would allow for absolute , universal certainty . '' Avicenna added two further methods for finding a first principle : the ancient Aristotelian method of induction ( istiqra ) , and the more recent method of examination and experimentation ( tajriba ) . Avicenna criticized Aristotelian induction , arguing that `` it does not lead to the absolute , universal , and certain premises that it purports to provide . '' In its place , he advocated `` a method of experimentation as a means for scientific inquiry . ''
