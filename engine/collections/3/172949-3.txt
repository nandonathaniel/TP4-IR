Hicks later agreed that the model missed important points of Keynesian theory , criticizing it as having very limited use beyond `` a classroom gadget '' , and criticizing equilibrium methods generally : `` When one turns to questions of policy , looking towards the future instead of the past , the use of equilibrium methods is still more suspect . '' The first problem was that it presents the real and monetary sectors as separate , something Keynes attempted to transcend . In addition , an equilibrium model ignores uncertainty -- and that liquidity preference only makes sense in the presence of uncertainty `` For there is no sense in liquidity , unless expectations are uncertain . '' A shift in one of the IS or LM curves will cause a change in expectations , which shifts the other curve .
