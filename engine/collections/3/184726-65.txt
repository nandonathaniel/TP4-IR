Divisions are commonly designated by combining an ordinal number and a type name . Nicknames are often assigned or adopted , although these often are not considered an official part of the unit 's nomenclature . In some cases , divisional titles lack an ordinal number , often in the case of unique units or units serving as elite or special troops . For clarity in histories and reports , the nation is identified before the number . This also helps in historical studies , but due to the nature of intelligence on the battlefield , division names and assignments are at times obscured . However , the size of the division rarely makes such obfuscation necessary .
