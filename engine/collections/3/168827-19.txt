There are a few exceptions to these guidelines that are important to note . If an account owner is depositing into an account that does not qualify for the exception hold but also owns another account that does qualify , then the Exception NSF Hold can be placed . In the same manner , if an account owner is depositing into an account that has been open for less than 30 days but owns another account that has been open greater than 30 days , the New Account Hold can not be legally placed .
