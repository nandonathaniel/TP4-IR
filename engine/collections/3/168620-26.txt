Kelso needs to do some budget cuts , and he figures out he has to fire someone . Dr. Cox bets that he can do it without firing anyone , but after many hours of working , he finds that it is inevitable . The next day at lunch , Janitor points out all the lunchroom workers Dr. Cox should n't fire . Finally he points out Kenny , who pours the coffee ; he happens to be the newest lunchroom worker . When the show switches to `` sitcom mode '' , a talent show happens at the hospital ( with the prize being exactly the same amount that the hospital needs to save ) . Everyone tries their best , J.D. doing his famous `` World 's most giant Doctor '' act , when finally Kenny sings and wins the money . However , it turns out the sitcom mode is fake and Dr. Cox does have to fire Kenny .
