In set theory ( and , usually , in other parts of mathematics ) , a Cartesian product is a mathematical operation that returns a set ( or product set or simply product ) from multiple sets . That is , for sets A and B , the Cartesian product A × B is the set of all ordered pairs ( a , b ) where a ∈ A and b ∈ B. Products can be specified using set - builder notation , e.g.
