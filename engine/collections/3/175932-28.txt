Collision resistance It should be difficult to find two different messages m and m such that hash ( m ) = hash ( m ) . Such a pair is called a cryptographic hash collision . This property is sometimes referred to as strong collision resistance . It requires a hash value at least twice as long as that required for pre-image resistance ; otherwise collisions may be found by a birthday attack .
