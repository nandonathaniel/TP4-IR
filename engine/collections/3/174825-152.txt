Lithium oxide is widely used as a flux for processing silica , reducing the melting point and viscosity of the material and leading to glazes with improved physical properties including low coefficients of thermal expansion . Worldwide , this is one of the largest use for lithium compounds . Glazes containing lithium oxides are used for ovenware . Lithium carbonate ( Li CO ) is generally used in this application because it converts to the oxide upon heating .
