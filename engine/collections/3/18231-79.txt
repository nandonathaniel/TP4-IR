After 1993 , Armstrong refused all requests for autographs because his signed items were selling for large amounts of money and many forgeries were in circulation ; any requests that were sent to him received a form letter in reply , saying that he had stopped signing . Although his no - autograph policy was well known , author Andrew Smith observed people at the 2002 Reno Air Races trying to get signatures , with one person claiming , `` If you shove something close enough in front of his face , he 'll sign . '' He also stopped sending out congratulatory letters to new Eagle Scouts , because he believed these letters should come from people who knew the Scouts personally .
