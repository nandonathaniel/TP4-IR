Polish pianist Ignacy Paderewski came to the U.S. and asked immigrants for help . He raised awareness of the plight and suffering in Poland before and after World War I. Paderewski used his name recognition to promote the sale of dolls to benefit Poland . The dolls , dressed in traditional Polish garb , had `` Halka and Jan '' as main characters . Sales provided enough money for the Polish refugees in Paris who designed the dolls to survive , and extra profits were used to purchase and distribute food to the poor in Poland .
