In addition to jury sentencing through the guidance of aggravating factors , a constitutional capital sentencing scheme must provide for appellate review of the death sentence , typically by the state 's supreme court . This review must not be a rubber stamp ; there must be evidence in the state 's decisional law that the court takes seriously its responsibility to ensure that the sentence imposed was not arbitrary . Currently , those states which still maintain a death penalty option have a mandatory appeal of the sentence ( defendants sentenced to death can not waive this appeal , but can waive appeals beyond this stage subject to a competency hearing ) .
