The Arroyo Seco ( Spanish : `` dry gulch , or streambed '' ) is an intermittent stream that carries rainfall from the San Gabriel Mountains southerly through western Pasadena into the Los Angeles River near downtown Los Angeles . During the dry season , it served as a faster wagon connection between the two cities than the all - weather road on the present Huntington Drive .
