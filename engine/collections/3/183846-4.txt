`` Food is a weapon '' , stated Earl Butz , the United States Secretary of Agriculture , in 1974 . OPEC 's use of oil as a political weapon brought on the possibility for America to use food as a tool against other states and to further the US 's goals . There are alternative uses of food power as well . An importer can refuse to continue import unless political concessions are made . This would have the same effects that an exporter refusing to export would have . An example of this would be American reduction of the Cuban sugar quota . In simple terms , the demand concentration ( one importer being the dominant buyer ) and supply dispersion ( several exporters competing to sell the same product ) an importer can try to use this exchange politically to their favor ; this is especially effective if the exporter has little else so export ( low action independence ) .
