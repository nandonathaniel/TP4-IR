It is now believed that the hepatitis B vaccine provides indefinite protection . However , it was previously believed and suggested that the vaccination would only provide effective cover of between five and seven years , but subsequently it has been appreciated that long - term immunity derives from immunological memory which outlasts the loss of antibody levels and hence subsequent testing and administration of booster doses is not required in successfully vaccinated immunocompetent individuals . Hence with the passage of time and longer experience , protection has been shown for at least 25 years in those who showed an adequate initial response to the primary course of vaccinations , and UK guidelines now suggest that for initial responders who require ongoing protection , such as for healthcare workers , only a single booster is advocated at 5 years .
