Technical specifications for the Indianapolis 500 are currently written by IndyCar . Rules are generally the same as every other IndyCar race . In the past , particularly during the era in which USAC sanctioned the Indy 500 ( but CART sanctioned the other Indy car races ) , rules at Indy slightly differed at times . The result , for example , would be a particular chassis or engine configuration being legal at Indy , but not so at the CART - sanctioned events . This was rather commonplace in the 1980s and early 1990s , when `` stock - block '' engines ( namely the V - 6 Buick ) was allotted an increased level of turbocharger boost by USAC at Indy , compared to the purpose - built V - 8 quad - cam engines . While the `` stock block '' engines were technically legal in CART competition , they were not given the increased boost advantage , which effectively rendered them uncompetitive , and precluded their use by teams . The most famous manifestation of the USAC rules disparity was the Ilmor - built Mercedes - Benz 500I engine fielded by Roger Penske in 1994 .
