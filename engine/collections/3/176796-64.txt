Beyond the times of the Mahavira and the Buddha , the two ascetic sramana religions competed for followers , as well merchant trade networks that sustained them . Their mutual interaction , along with those of Hindu traditions have been significant , and in some cases the titles of the Buddhist and Jaina texts are same or similar but present different doctrines . Jainism had a tradition of itinerant mendicants with less emphasis on a monastery style living for monks . Buddhism , in contrast , emphasized sangha or monasteries . According to Akira Hirakawa , the monasteries were easier targets for destruction and elimination , and Buddhism almost vanished from the Indian subcontinent after the Muslim invasions . In contrast , the roaming mendicants and the Jain tradition survived during this period of religious violence and turmoil .
