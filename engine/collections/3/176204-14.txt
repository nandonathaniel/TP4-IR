Gall Size âˆ’ The Eurosta salidaginis fly lays its eggs on the tip of plants , which then encase the larvae in a protective gall . The size of this gall is under stabilizing selection , as determined by predation . These larvae are under threat from parasitic wasps , which lay a single egg in galls containing the flies . The single wasp offspring then consumes the fly larvae to survive . Therefore , a larger gall is favored to allow more places for larvae to hide from the wasp . However , larger galls attract a different type of predation from birds , as they can penetrate large galls with their beak . Therefore , the optimal gall is moderately sized in order to avoid predation from both birds and wasps .
