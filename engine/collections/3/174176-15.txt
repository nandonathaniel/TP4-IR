The most common and empirically supported method for assessing attachment in infants ( 11 months -- 17 months ) is the Strange Situation Protocol , developed by Mary Ainsworth as a result of her careful in - depth observations of infants with their mothers in Baltimore , USA ( see below ) . The Strange Situation Protocol is a research tool that was not intended for diagnostic purposes . While the procedure may be used to supplement clinical impressions , the resulting classifications should not be confused with the psychiatric diagnosis ' Reactive Attachment Disorder ( RAD ) ' . The clinical concept of RAD differs in a number of fundamental ways from the theory and research driven attachment classifications based on the Strange Situation Procedure . The idea that insecure attachments are synonymous with RAD is , in fact , not accurate and leads to ambiguity when formally discussing attachment theory as it has evolved in the research literature . This is not to suggest that the concept of RAD is without merit , but rather that the clinical and research conceptualizations of insecure attachment and attachment disorder are not synonymous .
