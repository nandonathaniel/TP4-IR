North America occupies the northern portion of the landmass generally referred to as the New World , the Western Hemisphere , the Americas , or simply America ( which , less commonly , is considered by some as a single continent with North America a subcontinent ) . North America 's only land connection to South America is at the Isthmus of Panama . The continent is delimited on the southeast by most geographers at the Dari√©n watershed along the Colombia - Panama border , placing all of Panama within North America . Alternatively , some geologists physiographically locate its southern limit at the Isthmus of Tehuantepec , Mexico , with Central America extending southeastward to South America from this point . The Caribbean islands , or West Indies , are considered part of North America . The continental coastline is long and irregular . The Gulf of Mexico is the largest body of water indenting the continent , followed by Hudson Bay . Others include the Gulf of Saint Lawrence and the Gulf of California .
