The hydrogen in ammonia is capable of replacement by metals ; thus , magnesium burns in the gas with the formation of magnesium nitride Mg N , and when the gas is passed over heated sodium or potassium , sodamide , NaNH , and potassamide , KNH , are formed . Where necessary in substitutive nomenclature , IUPAC recommendations prefer the name `` azane '' to ammonia : hence chloramine would be named `` chloroazane '' in substitutive nomenclature , not `` chloroammonia '' .
