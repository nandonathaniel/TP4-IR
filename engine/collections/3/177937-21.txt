The show has over two million listeners on Radio 4 and its recording sessions typically fill 1500 - seat theatres within a week of being advertised . At least one recording for the spring 2006 series filled all its seats within three hours of the free tickets being made available , and the London recording of the autumn series in that year sold out in ten minutes . Although there are twelve Clue shows broadcast per year these are the result of just six recording sessions , with two programmes being recorded back - to - back . The show was recently voted the second funniest radio programme ever , after The Goon Show . It has a large following among professional comedians such as Armando Iannucci , who turned down opportunities to work on it as he preferred to remain a listener .
