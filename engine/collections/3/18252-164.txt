Since the Dissolution of the Monasteries , the Lords Temporal have been the most numerous group in the House of Lords . Unlike the Lords Spiritual , they may be publicly partisan , aligning themselves with one or another of the political parties that dominate the House of Commons . Publicly non-partisan Lords are called crossbenchers . Originally , the Lords Temporal included several hundred hereditary peers ( that is , those whose peerages may be inherited ) , who ranked variously as dukes , marquesses , earls , viscounts , and barons ( as well as Scottish Lords of Parliament ) . Such hereditary dignities can be created by the Crown ; in modern times this is done on the advice of the Prime Minister of the day ( except in the case of members of the Royal Family ) .
