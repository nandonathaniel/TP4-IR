Flight Lieutenant George Harsh RCAF was a member of the Great Escape 's executive committee and the camp `` security officer '' . He was one of the 19 `` suspects '' transferred to Belaria compound shortly before the escape . Born in 1910 to a wealthy and prominent Georgia family , Harsh , a medical student , was sentenced to life imprisonment in 1929 for the self - confessed thrill killing of a grocer . He saved the life of a fellow prisoner by performing an emergency appendectomy , for which Georgia governor Eugene Talmadge released him on parole in November 1940 and finally granted him a full pardon . He then joined the RCAF as a tail gunner and after being shot down in 1942 was sent to Stalag Luft III . In 1971 he published his autobiography which has since been translated into German and Russian .
