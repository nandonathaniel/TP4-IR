Most molecules are far too small to be seen with the naked eye , but there are exceptions . DNA , a macromolecule , can reach macroscopic sizes , as can molecules of many polymers . Molecules commonly used as building blocks for organic synthesis have a dimension of a few angstroms ( Å ) to several dozen Å , or around one billionth of a meter . Single molecules can not usually be observed by light ( as noted above ) , but small molecules and even the outlines of individual atoms may be traced in some circumstances by use of an atomic force microscope . Some of the largest molecules are macromolecules or supermolecules .
