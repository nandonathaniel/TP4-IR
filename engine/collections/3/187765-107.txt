This figure was obtained by doubling 78 billion light - years on the assumption that it is a radius . Because 78 billion light - years is already a diameter ( the original paper by Cornish et al. says , `` By extending the search to all possible orientations , we will be able to exclude the possibility that we live in a universe smaller than 24 Gpc in diameter , '' and 24 Gpc is 78 billion light - years ) , the doubled figure is incorrect . This figure was very widely reported . A press release from Montana State University -- Bozeman , where Cornish works as an astrophysicist , noted the error when discussing a story that had appeared in Discover magazine , saying `` Discover mistakenly reported that the universe was 156 billion light - years wide , thinking that 78 billion was the radius of the universe instead of its diameter . '' As noted above , 78 billion was also incorrect .
