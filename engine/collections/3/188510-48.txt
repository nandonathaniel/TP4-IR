An important contributor to the discussion concerning the proper relationship between Church and state was St. Augustine , who in The City of God , Book XIX , Chapter 17 , began an examination of the ideal relationship between the `` earthly city '' and the `` city of God '' . In this work , Augustine posited that major points of overlap were to be found between the `` earthly city '' and the `` city of God '' , especially as people need to live together and get along on earth . Thus Augustine held that it was the work of the `` temporal city '' to make it possible for a `` heavenly city '' to be established on earth .
