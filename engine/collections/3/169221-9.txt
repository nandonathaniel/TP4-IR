In Africa , salt was used as currency south of the Sahara , and slabs of rock salt were used as coins in Abyssinia . Moorish merchants in the 6th century traded salt for gold , weight for weight . The Tuareg have traditionally maintained routes across the Sahara especially for the transportation of salt by Azalai ( salt caravans ) . The caravans still cross the desert from southern Niger to Bilma , although much of the trade now takes place by truck . Each camel takes two bales of fodder and two of trade goods northwards and returns laden with salt pillars and dates . In Gabon , before the arrival of Europeans , the coast people carried on a remunerative trade with those of the interior by the medium of sea salt . This was gradually displaced by the salt that Europeans brought in sacks , so that the coast natives lost their previous profits ; as of the author 's writing in 1958 , sea salt was still the currency best appreciated in the interior .
