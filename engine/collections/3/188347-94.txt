On February 4 , 1815 , the fleet , with all of the British troops aboard , set sail toward Mobile Bay , Alabama . The British army then attacked and captured Fort Bowyer at the mouth of Mobile Bay on February 12 . The following day , the British army was making preparations to attack Mobile when news arrived of the peace treaty . General Jackson had made tentative plans to attack the British at Mobile and continue the war into Spanish Florida on the grounds the British were using it as a base . He carried out those plans for Florida much later . The treaty had been ratified by the British Parliament but would not be ratified by Congress and the President until mid-February . It did , however , resolve that hostilities should cease , and the British abandoned Fort Bowyer and sailed home to their base in the West Indies . Although the Battle of New Orleans had no influence on the terms of the Treaty of Ghent , the defeat at New Orleans did compel Britain to abide by the treaty .
