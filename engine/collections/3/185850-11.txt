Authorities and shelters examine strays for chips , providing the recovery service with the ID number , description and location so they may notify the owner or contact . If the pet is wearing the collar tag , the finder does not need a chip reader to contact the registry . An owner can also report a missing pet to the recovery service , as vets look for chips in new animals and check with the recovery service to see if it has been reported lost or stolen .
