Ryan is featured prominently in Command Authority ; Ryan and his administration contend with the Russian Federation , currently led by their new President , Valeri Volodin . Volodin is established as a dedicated communist opposed to the West , seeking to restore Russia as a strengthened Soviet Union . Volodin moves to establish ties with Iran and China , reunify the nation 's state security services under the FSB , and most notably annex the Ukraine . Those opposed to his actions are replaced or assassinated by Russian government forces or elements of the `` Seven Strong Men '' , a Mafia group that is now easily the most powerful and dangerous criminal underworld faction in Russia . Later , when the FSB and SVR merged under the FSB 's banner , Volodin makes the announcement that FSB director Roman Romanovich Talanov , Volodin 's enigmatic enforcer , is the nation 's new intelligence chief .
