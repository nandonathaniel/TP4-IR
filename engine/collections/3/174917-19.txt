Perfect multicollinearity is fairly common when working with raw datasets , which frequently contain redundant information . Once redundancies are identified and removed , however , nearly multicollinear variables often remain due to correlations inherent in the system being studied . In such a case , instead of the above equation holding , we have that equation in modified form with an error term v i ( \ displaystyle v_ ( i ) ) :
