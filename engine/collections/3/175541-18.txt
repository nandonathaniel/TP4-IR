Unable to win any acting roles initially , he worked in a variety of jobs including as a waiter , a telemarketer and a demonstrator of how toys work at fairs . Whilst in London , he met an old friend from his teenage days in the Scottish Youth Theatre , who was now a London casting director . At that time , he was her boyfriend and her assistant . She took him to an audition for Steven Berkoff 's play of Coriolanus . The director said of Butler 's audition , `` When he read , he had such vigour and enthusiasm -- so much that it made the other actors seem limp -- that I decided to cast him in the ensemble . ''
