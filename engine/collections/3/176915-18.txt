The names of the peaks commemorate a 19th century chief , Maripi , and three of his wives . The flat - topped peak adjacent to the rondavels is Mapjaneng , `` the chief '' , who is remembered for opposing invading Swazis in a memorable battle . The three rondavels are named for three of his more troublesome wives -- Magabolle , Mogoladikwe and Maseroto . Behind the rondavels the distant high plateau of Mariepskop may be visible . Beside the dam , the isolated Thabaneng hill is known as the `` sundial '' or `` mountain with a shadow that moves '' . It is said that the position of its shadow indicates the time of day .
