Initially , the British followed a policy of non-intervention in relations between the Malay states . The commercial importance of tin mining in the Malay states to merchants in the Straits Settlements led to infighting between the aristocracy on the peninsula . The destabilisation of these states damaged the commerce in the area , causing British intervention . The wealth of Perak 's tin mines made political stability there a priority for British investors , and Perak was thus the first Malay state to agree to the supervision of a British resident . British gunboat diplomacy was employed to bring about a peaceful resolution to civil disturbances caused by Chinese and Malay gangsters employed in a political fight between Ngah Ibrahim and Raja Muda Abdullah . The Pangkor Treaty of 1874 paved the way for the expansion of British influence in Malaya . The British concluded treaties with some Malay states , installing `` residents '' who advised the Sultans and soon became the effective rulers of their states . These advisors held power in everything except to do with Malay religion and customs .
