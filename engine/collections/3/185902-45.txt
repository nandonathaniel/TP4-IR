IGN gives the film a positive review with a score of 8 out of 10 . The reviewer forgives the misleading title , recognising the story is all about `` Supergirl of Krypton '' and once you know what you 're in for the story is not bad . Glau is praised for giving depth to what could have come across as whiny teenager , and her story is a complete journey but unfortunately the other characters are not given much to do .
