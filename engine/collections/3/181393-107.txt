President Donald Trump 's main proposed change to the capital gains tax was to repeal the 3.8 % Medicare surtax that took effect in 2013 . He also proposed to repeal the Alternative Minimum Tax , which would reduce tax liability for taxpayers with large incomes including capital gains . His maximum tax rate of 15 % on businesses could result in lower capital gains taxes . However , as well as lowering tax rates on ordinary income , he would lower the dollar amounts for the remaining tax brackets , which would subject more individual capital gains to the top ( 20 % ) tax rate . Other Republican candidates proposed to lower the capital gains tax ( Ted Cruz proposed a 10 % rate ) , or eliminate it entirely ( such as Marco Rubio ) .
