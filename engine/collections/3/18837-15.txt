The consensus among geologists who have studied the geology of the Gulf of Mexico , is that before the Late Triassic , the Gulf of Mexico did not exist . Before the Late Triassic , the area now occupied by the Gulf of Mexico consisted of dry land , which included continental crust that now underlies Yucat√°n , within the middle of the large supercontinent of Pangea . This land lay south of a continuous mountain range that extended from north - central Mexico , through the Marathon Uplift in West Texas and the Ouachita Mountains of Oklahoma , and to Alabama where it linked directly to the Appalachian Mountains . It was created by the collision of continental plates that formed Pangea . As interpreted by Roy Van Arsdale and Randel T. Cox , this mountain range was breached in Late Cretaceous times by the formation of the Mississippi Embayment .
