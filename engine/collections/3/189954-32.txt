The British government denied an urgent request from Leopold Amery , the Indian secretary of state , and Archibald Wavell , the Viceroy of India , to stop exports of food from Bengal in order that it might be used for famine relief . Winston Churchill , then prime minister , dismissed these requests in a fashion that Amery regarded as `` Hitler - like , '' by asking why , if the famine was so horrible , Gandhi had not yet died of starvation . Indeed , he refused to allow free relief shipments of food from the United States and Canada into Bengal on the grounds that the food was needed more elsewhere and because the Japanese Navy was patrolling the Bay of Bengal .
