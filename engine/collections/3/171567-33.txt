Agra features a semiarid climate that borders on a humid subtropical climate . The city features mild winters , hot and dry summers and a monsoon season . However the monsoons , though substantial in Agra , are not quite as heavy as the monsoon in other parts of India . This is a primary factor in Agra featuring a semiarid climate as opposed to a humid subtropical climate .
