As the College modernized in the late 19th century , the faculty was organized into departments and began to add graduate programs , especially the PhD . Charles William Eliot , president from 1869 to 1909 , was a chemist who had spent two years in Germany studying their universities . Thousands of Americans , mostly Harvard and Yale alumni , had attended German universities , especially Berlin and GÃ¶ttingen . Eliot used the German model to set up graduate programs at Harvard and he formed a graduate department in 1872 , which granted its first Ph. D. degrees in 1873 to William Byerly in mathematics and Charles Whitney in history . Eliot set up the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences with its own dean and budget in 1890 , which dealt with graduate students and funded research programs .
