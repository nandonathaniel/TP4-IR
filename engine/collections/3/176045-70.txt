H. pylori was first discovered in the stomachs of patients with gastritis and ulcers in 1982 by Drs . Barry Marshall and Robin Warren of Perth , Australia . At the time , the conventional thinking was that no bacterium could live in the acid environment of the human stomach . In recognition of their discovery , Marshall and Warren were awarded the 2005 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine .
