The basic room purge equation is used in industrial hygiene . It determines the time required to reduce a known vapor concentration existing in a closed space to a lower vapor concentration . The equation can only be applied when the purged volume of vapor or gas is replaced with `` clean '' air or gas . For example , the equation can be used to calculate the time required at a certain ventilation rate to reduce a high carbon monoxide concentration in a room .
