The script seems to aim at making this an epic film , a `` genre '' that typically requires a big budget provided by a major film studio . That Ed Wood filmed the story with minimal financial resources underlines one of the qualities of his work : his ideas tended to be too expensive to actually put on film , yet the director attempted them anyway . As Rob Craig argues , Wood 's failed attempts result in the peculiar charm of the film to audiences . Craig finds that the film has much in common with both epic theatre ( `` grand melodrama on a minuscule budget '' ) and the Theatre of the Absurd ( characters acting as buffoons , nonsense and verbosity in dialogue , dream - like and fantasy imagery , hints of allegory , and a narrative structure where continuity is consistently undermined ) .
