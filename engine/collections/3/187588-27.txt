A 2013 Center for Economic and Policy Research ( CEPR ) review of multiple studies since 2000 indicated that there was `` little or no employment response to modest increases in the minimum wage . '' Another CEPR study in 2014 found that job creation within the United States is faster within states that raised their minimum wage . In 2014 , the state with the highest minimum wage in the nation , Washington , exceeded the national average for job growth in the United States .
