The 11 teams were selected from past contestants among the first ten seasons . Keoghan personally submitted a list of 15 teams that he thought should return . Ten of them were chosen . The team he did n't choose was Eric & Danielle , who did not previously race together . Keoghan said , `` I did n't think of that new combination , which actually is a really good one . '' He also added that the production team 's goal for the race `` was n't to pick the best racers '' , but `` to pick the teams that have earned the most attention over the last 10 seasons '' . Despite the `` All - Stars '' title , only one team , Uchenna & Joyce , had won a previous season . Some former racers were angered by their omission from All - Stars , most notably Chip and Kim McAllister ( Season 5 ) , and BJ Averell and Tyler MacNiven ( Season 9 ) , who publicly criticized CBS ' casting process .
