Once inside , Aladdin is instructed to bring the magic lamp to Jafar and touch nothing else . Astonished by all the treasure buried within the cave , Aladdin attempts to take some gold coins along with the lamp . The cave angrily seals itself , trapping Aladdin inside . Engulfed in darkness , Aladdin rubs the lamp which to his surprise unleashes a magical Genie who offers to grant him three wishes . Aladdin initially shrugs this off in disbelief , prompting the Genie to display his powers with an impressive musical number ( `` Friend Like Me '' ) . The Genie then reveals that he has limitations to his powers . He ca n't grant wishes that include murder , romance , revival of the dead , or wishing for additional wishes . Amused and overjoyed at his good fortune , Aladdin tricks Genie into magically freeing them from the cave without actually using a wish ; thereafter , Genie states that Aladdin will not receive any more magic help unless he explicitly states `` I wish '' . Genie muses that he would wish for freedom , since he is a prisoner of his lamp . Aladdin promises to free Genie as his last wish . Aladdin decides to use his first wish to become a prince in order to be legally able to court Jasmine ( Act One Finale : `` Friend Like Me '' / `` Proud of Your Boy '' ( Reprises ) ) .
