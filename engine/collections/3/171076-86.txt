By the Victorian era , the concept of `` pater familias '' , meaning the husband as head of the household and moral leader of his family , was firmly entrenched in British culture . A wife 's proper role was to love , honour and obey her husband , as her marriage vows stated . A wife 's place in the family hierarchy was secondary to her husband , but far from being considered unimportant , a wife 's duties to tend to her husband and properly raise her children were considered crucial cornerstones of social stability by the Victorians .
