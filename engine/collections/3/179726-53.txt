Following the Roman -- Persian Wars and the Byzantine -- Sassanid Wars , deep - rooted differences between Iraq , formerly under the Persian Sassanid Empire , and Syria , formerly under the Byzantine Empire , also existed . Each wanted the capital of the newly established Islamic state to be in their area . Previously , the second caliph Umar was very firm on the governors and his spies kept an eye on them . If he felt that a governor or a commander was becoming attracted to wealth or did not meet the required administrative standards , he had him removed from his position .
