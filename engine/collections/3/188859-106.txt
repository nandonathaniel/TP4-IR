In the 19th century , African - American dance began to appear in minstrel shows . These shows often presented African Americans as caricatures for ridicule to large audiences . The first African - American dance to become popular with white dancers was the cakewalk in 1891 . Later dances to follow in this tradition include the Charleston , the Lindy Hop , the Jitterbug and the swing .
