According to observers outside Unit 4 , burning lumps of material and sparks shot into the air above the reactor . Some of them fell onto the roof of the machine hall and started a fire . About 25 percent of the red - hot graphite blocks and overheated material from the fuel channels was ejected . Parts of the graphite blocks and fuel channels were out of the reactor building . As a result of the damage to the building an airflow through the core was established by the high temperature of the core . The air ignited the hot graphite and started a graphite fire .
