The decline of Buddhism in the Indian subcontinent has been attributed to various factors , especially the regionalisation of ancient India after the end of the Gupta empire ( 320 - 650 CE ) , which led to a competition with Hinduism and Jainism , the loss of patronage and donations and the conquest and subsequent persecutions by Huns , then Muslim Turks and Persians particularly from the 10th century onwards .
