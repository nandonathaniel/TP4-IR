During the show , viewers are invited to donate money to 826LA , which is later provided in a lump sum to the charity . Donation amounts and messages appear live on the stream , and on earlier episodes , a list of donors was read at the end of each session . During Geek & Sundry 's 2015 Extra Life fundraiser , a special interactive episode was broadcast . This episode alone brought in over $20,000 for the Children 's Miracle Network , and the event as a whole raised over $76,000 . In late November 2015 , Geek & Sundry 's Twitch channel held a special Doctors Without Borders fundraiser , with nearly half of the $10,000 goal being raised during the 4 - hour Critical Role broadcast . In December 2015 , the cast released a `` Critter 's Guide to Critmas '' in response to the flood of gifts they were receiving from fans , asking them to instead donate to a variety of charities , with a cast member sponsoring each charity .
