James Madison advocated the ratification of the Constitution in The Federalist and at the Virginia ratifying convention upon a narrow construction of the clause , asserting that spending must be at least tangentially tied to one of the other specifically enumerated powers , such as regulating interstate or foreign commerce , or providing for the military , as the General Welfare Clause is not a specific grant of power , but a statement of purpose qualifying the power to tax . Alexander Hamilton , only after the Constitution had been ratified , argued for a broad interpretation which viewed spending as an enumerated power Congress could exercise independently to benefit the general welfare , such as to assist national needs in agriculture or education , provided that the spending is general in nature and does not favor any specific section of the country over any other .
