At the start of 2005 , Ronaldo played two of his best matches of the 2004 -- 05 season , producing a goal and an assist against Aston Villa and scoring twice against rivals Arsenal . After scoring four goals in United 's run to the FA Cup final , he played the full 120 minutes of the decisive match against Arsenal , which ended in a goalless draw , and scored his attempt in the lost penalty shootout .

He scored Manchester United 's 1000th Premier League goal on 29 October , their only strike in a 4 -- 1 loss to Middlesbrough . Midway through the season , in November , he signed a new contract which extended his previous deal by two years to 2010 . Ronaldo won his second trophy in English football , the Football League Cup , after scoring the third goal in United 's 4 -- 0 final victory over Wigan Athletic .
