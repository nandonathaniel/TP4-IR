In addition to the 50 states and federal district , the United States has sovereignty over 14 territories . Five of them ( American Samoa , Guam , the Northern Mariana Islands , Puerto Rico , and the U.S. Virgin Islands ) have a permanent , nonmilitary population , while nine of them do not . With the exception of Navassa Island , Puerto Rico , and the U.S. Virgin Islands , which are located in the Caribbean , all territories are located in the Pacific Ocean . One territory , Palmyra Atoll , is considered to be incorporated , meaning the full body of the Constitution has been applied to it ; the other territories are unincorporated , meaning the Constitution does not fully apply to them . Ten territories ( the Minor Outlying Islands and American Samoa ) are considered to be unorganized , meaning they have not had an Organic Act enacted by Congress ; the four other territories are organized , meaning they have had an Organic Act that has been enacted by Congress . The five inhabited territories each have limited autonomy and a non-voting delegate in Congress , in addition to having territorial legislatures and governors , but residents can not vote in federal elections .
