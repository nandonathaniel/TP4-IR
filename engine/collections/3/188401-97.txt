The designs of the halls are deliberately not identical . For example , the older halls - Mellanby , Tedder , Kuti , Sultan Bello and Queen Elizabeth II halls - were designed by Maxwell Fry and Jane Drew who , in appreciation of their contribution to the physical development of the University were honoured with honorary degrees in 1965 . Messrs Watkins Gray and Partners designed Alexander Brown Hall as a part of the overall design of the University College Hospital Complex . The two undergraduate halls , Independence and Nnamdi Azikiwe Halls , were designed by Messrs Design Group ( Nigeria ) Ltd . Obafemi Awolowo Hall was designed by Allied Group of Architects , while Tafawa Balewa and Idia Halls were designed by Messrs Aderele - Omisore - Adebanjo Associates . The Federal Ministry of Works designed the Abdusalami Abubakar Hall . Students are usually very passionate about their respective halls .
