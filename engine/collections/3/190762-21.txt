Co-creator Stan Lee recounted that the name was inspired by a pulp adventure hero who has a black panther as a helper . Because many people mistakenly assumed the name referenced the Black Panther Party , the character was briefly renamed the Black Leopard , which Lee said was reverted because neither the readers nor the creators cared for the new name . Jack Kirby 's original concept art for Black Panther used the concept name , `` Coal Tiger . ''
