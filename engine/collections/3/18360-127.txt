Different groups of marine worms are related only distantly , so they are found in several different phyla such as the Annelida ( segmented worms ) , Chaetognatha ( arrow worms ) , Hemichordata , and Phoronida ( horseshoe worms ) . Many of these worms have specialized tentacles used for exchanging oxygen and carbon dioxide and also may be used for reproduction . Some marine worms are tube worms , such as the giant tube worm which lives in waters near underwater volcanoes and can withstand temperatures up to 90 degrees Celsius .
