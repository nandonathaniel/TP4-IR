Three key interventions were discussed and disseminated ; ventilation by enlarging windows or opening eaves spaces , adding smoke hoods over the cooking area , or the option of installing an improved cook stove such as the Upesi stove . Smoke hoods are free - standing units that act like flues or chimneys in their effort to draw smoke out of the dwelling . They can be used over traditional open fires and this study showed they contribute to considerably lower levels of IAP . The smoke hood models were made with hard manila paper and then transferred to heavy - gauge galvanized sheet metal and manufactured locally . This resulted in further employment opportunities for the artisans who were trained by the project . The Upesi stove , made of clay and kiln - fired , was developed by Practical Action and East African partners to utilize wood and agricultural wastes . Because this stove was designed and adapted for local needs it produced several winning features . Not only does it cut the use of fuel - wood by approximately half , and reduce exposure to household smoke , it also empowers local women by creating employment as they are the ones who make and market the stoves . These women 's groups gain access to technical training in production and marketing and enjoy higher wage earnings and improved social status as a result of the introduction of this improved stove .
