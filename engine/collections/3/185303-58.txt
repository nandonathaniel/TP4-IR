`` Anne - Marie '' was defended by Tai troops , members of a Vietnamese ethnic minority loyal to the French . For weeks , Gi√°p had distributed subversive propaganda leaflets , telling the Tais that this was not their fight . The fall of `` Beatrice '' and `` Gabrielle '' had severely demoralized them . On the morning of 17 March , under the cover of fog , the bulk of the Tais left or defected . The French and the few remaining Tais on `` Anne - Marie '' were then forced to withdraw .
