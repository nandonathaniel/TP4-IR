Article III states , `` It is agreed , that it shall at all times be free to His Majesty 's subjects , and to the citizens of the United States , and also to the Indians dwelling on either side of the said boundary line , freely to pass and repass , by land or inland navigation into the respective territories and countries of the two parties on the continent of America , ( the country within the limits of the Hudson 's Bay Company only excepted ) ... and freely carry on trade and commerce with each other . '' Article III of the Jay Treaty declared the right of Indians , American citizens , and Canadian subjects to trade and travel between the United States and Canada , which was then a territory of Great Britain . Over the years since , the United States has codified this obligation in the provisions of Section 289 of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 and as amended in 1965 . As a result of the Jay Treaty , `` Native Indians born in Canada are therefore entitled to enter the United States for the purpose of employment , study , retirement , investing , and / or immigration '' . Article III of the Jay Treaty is the basis of most Indian claims .
