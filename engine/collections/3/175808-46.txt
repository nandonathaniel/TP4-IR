Schapiro refers to the cypress in the painting as a `` vague symbol of a human striving . '' Boime calls it the `` symbolic counterpart of Van Gogh 's own striving for the Infinite through non-orthodox channels . '' Art historian Vojtech Jirat - Wasiutynski says that for Van Gogh the cypresses `` function as rustic and natural obelisks '' providing a `` link between the heavens and the earth . '' ( Some commentators see one tree , others see two or more . ) Loevgren reminds the reader that `` the cypress is the tree of death in the Mediterranean countries . ''
