According to Anthony , the Old Indic religion probably emerged among Indo - European immigrants in the contact zone between the Zeravshan River ( present - day Uzbekistan ) and ( present - day ) Iran . It was `` a syncretic mixture of old Central Asian and new Indo - European elements '' , which borrowed `` distinctive religious beliefs and practices '' from the Bactria -- Margiana Culture . At least 383 non-Indo - European words were borrowed from this culture , including the god Indra and the ritual drink Soma .
