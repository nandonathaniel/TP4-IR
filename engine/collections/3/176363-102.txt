Broderick starred in a television advertisement prepared by Honda promoting its CR - V for the 2012 Super Bowl XLVI . The ad pays homage to Ferris Bueller , featuring Broderick ( as himself ) faking illness to skip out of work to enjoy sightseeing around Los Angeles . Several elements , such as the use of the song `` Oh Yeah '' , and a valet monotonously calling for `` Broderick ... Broderick ... '' , appear in the ad . A teaser for the ad had appeared two weeks prior to the Super Bowl , which had created rumors of a possible film sequel . It was produced by Santa Monica - based RPA and directed by Todd Phillips . AdWeek 's Tim Nudd called the ad `` a great homage to the original 1986 film , with Broderick this time calling in sick to a film shoot and enjoying another day of slacking . '' On the other hand , Jalopnik 's Matt Hardigree called the spot `` sacrilegious '' .
