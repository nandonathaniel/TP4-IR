A second problem is that nominally `` twelve - volt '' power in cars fluctuates widely . The actual voltage will be approximately 12.5 volts when dormant ( less in cold conditions ) , approximately 14.5 volts when the engine and the alternator / generator are operating ( more when cold ) , and may briefly drop as low as 5 -- 6 volts during engine start . When used , DC to DC converters will usually compensate for small fluctuations , but reliable power may not be available without an independent battery - powered uninterruptible power supply .
