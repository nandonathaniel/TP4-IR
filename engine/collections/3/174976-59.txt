In previous dynasties the Song , Jin , and Yuan dynasties reigned for much of the beginning three centuries where the mandate of heaven was questioned heavenly between dynastic councils among each emperor . Some emperors were not entirely sure of their validity when it came to claiming the mandate , for it was ambiguous . Especially for the case of the Jurchen Jin , where much of the council was not sure how to discern the validity of their rulers . From the Emperor Gaozong of the Tang Dynasty to Kangxi Emperor much of the chosen emperors contemplated much of this when they became a contender for the mandate . The reason for this was because of the ambiguity of the Mandate and overwhelmingly unofficial formality when declaring the Mandate of Heaven . However , Kubilai Khan was the only indifferent ruler when he claimed the Mandate of Heaven over the Yuan Dynasty since he had a sizable military and was part of the Khitan people , as with many others from the same background since they did not have the same traditions and culture as their Chinese adversaries .
