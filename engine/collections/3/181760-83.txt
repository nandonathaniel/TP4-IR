In the 1930s , Germany had experimented with the laying of mines by aircraft ; it became a crucial element in their overall mining strategy . Aircraft had the advantage of speed , and they would never get caught in their own minefields . German mines held a large 1,000 pounds ( 450 kg ) explosive charge . From April to June 1940 , the Luftwaffe laid 1,000 mines in British waters . Soviet ports were mined , as was the Arctic convoy route to Murmansk . The Heinkel He 115 could carry two medium or one large mine while the Heinkel He 59 , Dornier Do 18 , Junkers Ju 88 and Heinkel He 111 could carry more .
