The Learning Style Inventory ( LSI ) is connected with David A. Kolb 's model and is used to determine a student 's learning style . Previous versions of the LSI have been criticized for problems with validity , reliability , and other issues . Version 4 of the Learning Style Inventory replaces the four learning styles of previous versions with nine new learning styles : initiating , experiencing , imagining , reflecting , analyzing , thinking , deciding , acting , and balancing . The LSI is intended to help employees or students `` understand how their learning style impacts upon problem solving , teamwork , handling conflict , communication and career choice ; develop more learning flexibility ; find out why teams work well -- or badly -- together ; strengthen their overall learning .
