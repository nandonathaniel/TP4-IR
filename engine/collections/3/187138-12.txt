Many physicians are slow to refer to hospice care , waiting until they are absolutely certain of a terminal prognosis . Some physicians believe that the patient must have a six - month prognosis or less to receive hospice care , while others are overly optimistic in their assessment of prognosis , presuming treatment will be more effective than it is . As a result , the majority of patients are referred to hospice in the very end - stages of their diseases . The average length of stay in hospice before a patient dies was 26 days in 1994 , but only 19 days in 1998 . Although these numbers have since increased , the term of care continues to be underutilized , with an average length of stay in 2004 of 57 days and a median length of 22 days . 33 % of hospice patients admitted in 2004 died within seven days of admission . Such late admission is inconsistent with the process of hospice , which requires time for patients and family members to develop relationships with the hospice team .
