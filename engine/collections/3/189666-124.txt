Bruce Henderson , founder of the Boston Consulting Group , wrote about the concept of the experience curve in 1968 , following initial work begun in 1965 . The experience curve refers to a hypothesis that unit production costs decline by 20 -- 30 % every time cumulative production doubles . This supported the argument for achieving higher market share and economies of scale .
