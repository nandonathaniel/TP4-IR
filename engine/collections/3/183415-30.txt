Pippin 's relationship with Denethor is also altered significantly . In the movie , Pippin 's oath of service to Denethor is comical to Gandalf , who openly disapproves . In the novel , Gandalf does not suggest Pippin join Denethor 's service , but praises him for such an honourable course of action and treats his oath with dignity . Pippin himself is proud to be in Denethor 's service , and is deeply worried about his new master . When Denethor suggests Pippin might sing a song , the latter does not consider himself or Shire songs worthy of the lord , and in the end is not forced to sing . When confronting Gandalf on his pyre , Denethor reveals that he considered Pippin a spy sent by Gandalf , and this suspicion is apparently vindicated when Pippin is the one who brings Gandalf to the citadel before Denethor 's pyre is lit . He also reveals that he kept Pippin in his service , in spite of considering him a spy , for the purpose of extracting information out of him in turn ( ostensibly about Aragorn ) .
