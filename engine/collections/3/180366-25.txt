The U.S. Federal government suspended issuing 30 - year Treasury bonds for four years from February 18 , 2002 to February 9 , 2006 . As the U.S. government used budget surpluses to pay down Federal debt in the late 1990s , the 10 - year Treasury note began to replace the 30 - year Treasury bond as the general , most - followed metric of the U.S. bond market . However , because of demand from pension funds and large , long - term institutional investors , along with a need to diversify the Treasury 's liabilities -- and also because the flatter yield curve meant that the opportunity cost of selling long - dated debt had dropped -- the 30 - year Treasury bond was re-introduced in February 2006 and is now issued quarterly .
