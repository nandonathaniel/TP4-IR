His best friend is Rowley Jefferson , who takes part in Greg 's schemes , and is sometimes a victim of Greg 's manipulation and deception . The two have a very complicated relationship , as Greg sometimes takes advantage of Rowley 's good nature , and his own schemes fail due to Rowley 's foolishness , such as Rowley 's `` confession '' to the vandalized wall . Rowley 's parents , mostly his father , view Greg as a bad influence on their son . This is because Greg has a tendency for getting himself and Rowley into trouble .
