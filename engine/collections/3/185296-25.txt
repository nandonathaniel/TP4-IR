Early European settlers to the United States brought from Europe the concept of the commons . In the colonial era , access to natural resources was allocated by individual towns , and disputes over fisheries or land use were resolved at the local level . Changing technologies , however , strained traditional ways of resolving disputes of resource use , and local governments had limited control over powerful special interests . For example , the damming of rivers for mills cut off upriver towns from fisheries ; logging and clearing of forest in watersheds harmed local fisheries downstream . In New England , many farmers became uneasy as they noticed clearing of forest changed stream flows and a decrease in bird population which helped control insects and other pests . These concerns become widely known with the publication of Man and Nature ( 1864 ) by George Perkins Marsh . The environmental impact method of analysis is generally the main mode for determining what issues the environmental movement is involved in . This model is used to determine how to proceed in situations that are detrimental to the environment by choosing the way that is least damaging and has the fewest lasting implications .
