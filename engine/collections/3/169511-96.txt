After the First World War , Poland and Lithuania both regained their independence but soon became immersed in territorial disputes . During the Polish -- Soviet War , Lithuania signed the Moscow Peace Treaty with the Soviet Union that laid out Lithuania 's frontiers . This agreement gave Lithuanians control of the city of Vilnius ( Lithuanian : Vilnius , Polish : Wilno ) , the old Lithuanian capital , but a city with a majority Polish population . This heightened tension between Lithuania and Poland and led to fears that they would resume the Polish -- Lithuanian War , and on 7 October 1920 , the League negotiated the Suwałki Agreement establishing a cease - fire and a demarcation line between the two nations . On 9 October 1920 , General Lucjan Żeligowski , commanding a Polish military force in contravention of the Suwałki Agreement , took the city and established the Republic of Central Lithuania .
