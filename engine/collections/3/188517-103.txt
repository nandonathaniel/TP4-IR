Since 1640 , a Seneschal ( sénéchal ) , a Judge ( juge d'épée , which literally means ' sword - bearing judge ' ) , and a jurisdiction in Trois - Rivières were created . However , the Seneschal was under the oversight by the Governor , hence the Governor still had rather extensive control over legal matters in New France . In 1651 , the Company of New France made the Great Seneschal ( Grand Sénéchal ) the chief justice . However , the Island of Montreal had its special Governor at that time , who also administered justice on the Island , and had not handed over justice to the Grand Seneschal until 1652 .
