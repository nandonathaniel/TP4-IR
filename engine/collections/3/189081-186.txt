The near - completely enclosed configuration of the Mediterranean basin has enabled the oceanic gateways to dominate seawater circulation and the environmental evolution of the sea and basin . Circulation patterns are also affected by several other factors -- including climate , bathymetry , and water chemistry and temperature -- which are interactive and can induce precipitation of evaporites . Deposits of evaporites accumulated earlier in the nearby Carpathian foredeep during the Middle Miocene , and the adjacent Red Sea Basin ( during the Late Miocene ) , and in the whole Mediterranean basin ( during the MSC and the Messinian age ) . Diatomites are regularly found underneath the evaporite deposits , suggesting a connection between their geneses .
