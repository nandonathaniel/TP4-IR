Weedpatch Camp has its origins in the migrations during the drought that caused the Dust Bowl in the mid-1930s . Oklahoma was especially hard hit by the drought and many of the farmers there left . They migrated to California where they moved from farm to farm looking for work as farm laborers . They were joined by other migrant workers from Texas , Arkansas and Missouri . Housing for the migrants consisted of either squatter camps ( tents pitched by the side of a road ) or camps established by the farmers and growers . Because of the lack of hygiene and security that these types of camps offered , the FSA built labor camps consisting of permanent buildings with running water such as schools and libraries . The FSA also provided help locating work . The first administrator of Weedpatch Camp was Tom Collins .
