Teja comes to Falguni who consoles him and says that she will talk to Uttara . Falguni goes to talk and it results in a saree competition to see who is better . Falguni wins and Kalakaars get their jobs back . Falguni is thus taken into office projects . She keeps a fast which is not broken by Suyash upto 2 days . He then comes and breaks her fast . ( His heart softens a bit for her ) . Gayatri is revealed to have murdered someone the cause of which is unknown . Jayant ( Suyash and Vidhaan 's dad ) hates her due to misunderstanding between them created by Uttara . On Suyash 's birthday , Falguni tells him about Gayatri being her mother but she had gone away before it . He goes to find her but in vain . He fails in finding her and hires an investigator to find her . Falguni assists Suyash with this and he asks for her forgiveness for being ignorant towards her and treating her the way he did , he understood that there was a reason Falguni did what she did , but does n't hear it , and accepts her . They are openly in love once again , but Uttara is prepared to throw spanners in the works again .
