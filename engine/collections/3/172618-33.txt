The song became so popular that it was recorded by The New Seekers and by The Hillside Singers as a full - length song -- without the mention of Coke -- and both versions became huge hits . A version of the song was rerecorded by Susan Shirley and released in 1971 . Cook , Greenaway , Backer , and Billy Davis reworked the song and recorded it as a Coca - Cola radio commercial .
