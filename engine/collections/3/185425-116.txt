From Liberty City Stories through to Grand Theft Auto V , the series has continued using lesser known actors to voice main characters , but still uses celebrities and real - life radio personalities to voice the DJs of the many radio stations featured in each game . Some games also feature celebrities portraying themselves , such as Lazlow Jones , Phil Collins , Ricky Gervais and Katt Williams .
