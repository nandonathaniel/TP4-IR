Several texts concern themselves with the subsequent lives of the apostles , usually with highly supernatural events . Almost half of these , anciently called The Circuits of the Apostles and now known by the name of their purported author , `` Leucius Charinus '' ( supposedly a companion of John the apostle ) , contained the Acts of Peter , John , Andrew , Thomas , and Paul . These were judged by the Patriarch Photios I of Constantinople in the ninth century to be full of folly , self - contradiction , falsehood , and impiety . The Acts of Thomas and the Acts of Peter and the Twelve are often considered Gnostic texts . While most of the texts are believed to have been written in the 2nd century , at least two , the Acts of Barnabas and the Acts of Peter and Paul are believed to have been written as late as the 5th century .
