All stories starring Jon Pertwee as the Third Doctor are complete , though many episodes no longer survive on their original videotapes and were only available from black - and - white overseas prints upon recovery ; these episodes have subsequently been restored to colour using a variety of methods . In order of original transmissions , the very last Doctor Who master videotapes to be wiped were the first episodes of the 1974 serials Invasion of the Dinosaurs and Death to the Daleks . The latter was recovered from overseas , initially from a tape in the NTSC format , and later in the original PAL format on a tape returned from Dubai .
