Boone served as syndic and commandant until 1804 , when Missouri became part of the United States following the Louisiana Purchase . Because Boone 's land grants from the Spanish government had been largely based on verbal agreements , he once again lost his land claims . In 1809 , he petitioned Congress to restore his Spanish land claims , which was finally done in 1814 . Boone sold most of this land to repay old Kentucky debts . When the War of 1812 came to Missouri , Boone 's sons Daniel Morgan Boone and Nathan Boone took part , but by that time Boone was much too old for militia duty .
