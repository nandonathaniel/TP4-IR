While Hagen loves all the Corleones , he idolizes Sonny and blames himself for Sonny 's murder . When Vito semi-retires in 1954 and his youngest son , Michael , succeeds him as the operating head of the family , Michael removes Hagen as consigliere , preferring his father informally assume the role ; Michael claims Hagen is not a `` war - time '' consigliere . Hagen is thus restricted to handling the family 's legitimate business .
