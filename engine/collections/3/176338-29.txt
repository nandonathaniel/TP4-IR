In China , Trissolcus japonicus , a parasitoid wasp species in the family Scelionidae , is a primary predator . This species is not currently present in the U.S. , but is undergoing study for possible introduction . The major problem with this idea is the possibility that japonicus will also become an invasive species with no native predators . Before introducing the Chinese wasp , scientists are trying to find natural predators of the stink bug already present in the United States . To do so they have studied other species of parasitoid wasps native to the United States . They found that several other species of the parasitoid wasps attacked stink bug eggs in Virginia soybean fields . Researchers have also experimented with different spider species as well as the Wheel bug . Several spider species attacked both the eggs as well as live stink bugs . Pill bugs eat stinkbug eggs . The Wheel bug , however , was the most voracious predator and attacked the eggs as well as stink bugs more consistently . Scientists are hoping that other animals such as birds will eventually begin preying on stink bugs as populations continue to rise .
