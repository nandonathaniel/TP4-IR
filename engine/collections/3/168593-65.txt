Production may be in progress for some part , whose design gets changed , with customer orders in the system for both the old design , and the new one , concurrently . The overall ERP system needs to have a system of coding parts such that the MRP will correctly calculate needs and tracking for both versions . Parts must be booked into and out of stores more regularly than the MRP calculations take place . Note , these other systems can well be manual systems , but must interface to the MRP . For example , a ' walk around ' stock intake done just prior to the MRP calculations can be a practical solution for a small inventory ( especially if it is an `` open store '' ) .
