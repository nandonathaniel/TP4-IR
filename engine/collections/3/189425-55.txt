The concept for Tomb Raider originated in 1993 at Core Design , a British game development studio . One of the men most involved in its creation was Toby Gard , who was mostly responsible for creating the character of Lara Croft . Gard originally envisioned her as a man : company co-founder Jeremy Heath - Smith was worried the character would be seen as derivative of Indiana Jones , so Gard changed the character 's gender . Her design underwent multiple revisions and redrafts during early development . The game proved an unexpected commercial success , reversing Eidos ' then - bleak financial situation . After the success of Tomb Raider , work began almost at once on a sequel . After the first game 's success , Gard was no longer given full creative control , and it was stated by development staff that he was both saddened and disappointed by the use of Lara Croft 's sex appeal in marketing . Gard left Core Design in 1997 to found his own gaming company Confounding Factor , and was replaced by Stuart Atkinson . Tomb Raider II proved even more of a commercial success than the original .
