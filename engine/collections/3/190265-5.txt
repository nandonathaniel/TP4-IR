When a new request arrives while the drive is idle , the initial arm / head movement will be in the direction of the cylinder where the data is stored , either in or out . As additional requests arrive , requests are serviced only in the current direction of arm movement until the arm reaches the edge of the disk . When this happens , the direction of the arm reverses , and the requests that were remaining in the opposite direction are serviced , and so on .
