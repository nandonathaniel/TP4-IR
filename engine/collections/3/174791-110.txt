Leonard and Penny have started dating again . With Penny wanting to take things slow and Leonard determined to ensure that their relationship works out this time , they agree to an alpha test relationship - instead of them arguing with each other , they highlight each other 's faults and work on them . However this goes poorly as Leonard gives Penny a huge list of her faults , while Penny retaliates by giving Leonard a huge list of his faults . When he tries to patch things up by taking her target shooting , he accidentally shoots himself in the shoe , barely missing his toe . Later Penny assures him that their relationship is progressing smoothly . Meanwhile , Raj buys a new iPhone 4S and falls in love with its Siri as it is a female voice he can speak to without being drunk . He starts making decisions only after consulting Siri and even defends it after Kripke criticizes it for giving erroneous answers on his iPhone 4S ( due to his rhotacism ) . Later Raj has a nightmare in which he finally meets Siri , who is a beautiful woman , but can not talk to her due to his selective mutism . Elsewhere , Sheldon and Amy start a podcast about flags titled `` Fun With Flags '' . Amy provides some suggestions during the podcast , which Sheldon unexpectedly accepts , indicating a deep bond between the two .
