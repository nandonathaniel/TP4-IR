In 2001 , Lewis and Representative J.C. Watts re-introduced legislation for a museum in the House of Representatives . Under the leadership of its new Secretary , Lawrence M. Small , the Smithsonian Board of Regents reversed course yet again in June 2001 and agreed to support a stand - alone National Museum of African American History and Culture . The Smithsonian asked Congress to establish a federally funded study commission . Congress swiftly agreed , and on December 29 , President George W. Bush signed legislation establishing a 23 - member commission to study the need for a museum , how to raise the funds to build and support it , and where it should be located . At the signing ceremony , the president expressed his opinion that the museum should be located on the National Mall .
