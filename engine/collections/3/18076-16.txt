A bookkeeper on the eighth floor was able to warn employees on the tenth floor via telephone , but there was no audible alarm and no way to contact staff on the ninth floor . According to survivor Yetta Lubitz , the first warning of the fire on the ninth floor arrived at the same time as the fire itself . Although the floor had a number of exits , including two freight elevators , a fire escape , and stairways down to Greene Street and Washington Place , flames prevented workers from descending the Greene Street stairway , and the door to the Washington Place stairway was locked to prevent theft by the workers ; the locked doors allowed managers to check the women 's purses . The foreman who held the stairway door key had already escaped by another route . Dozens of employees escaped the fire by going up the Greene Street stairway to the roof . Other survivors were able to jam themselves into the elevators while they continued to operate .
