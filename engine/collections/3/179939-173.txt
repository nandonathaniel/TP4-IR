Stout was hired to work on the series and subsequently made a trailer to demonstrate how the series would look , and how it would combine traditional animation with computer animation . The series required Spielberg 's final approval before it could go into production . However , Spielberg had grown tired of the massive promotion and merchandise revolving around the film , and never watched the trailer . On July 13 , 1993 , Margaret Loesch , president of the Fox Children 's Network , confirmed that discussions had been held with Spielberg about an animated version of the film . Loesch also said , `` At least for now and in the foreseeable future , there will not be an animated Jurassic Park . That 's Steven Spielberg 's decision , and we respect that decision . ''
