Sam rescued Frodo from a band of orcs at the Tower of Cirith Ungol . The hobbits , followed by Gollum , eventually arrived at Mount Doom , where Frodo was overcome by the Ring 's power and claimed it for himself . At that moment , however , Gollum attacked him and bit off his finger , taking back the Ring . Gollum was too close to the edge : as he gloated over his prize he fell into the fires of Mount Doom , taking the Ring with him , thus destroying it and Sauron 's power .
