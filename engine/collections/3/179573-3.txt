Originally people refused to take De Mestral seriously when he took his idea to Lyon , which was then a center of weaving . He did manage to gain the help of one weaver , who made two cotton strips that worked . However , the cotton wore out quickly , so De Mestral turned to synthetic fibers . He settled on nylon as being the best synthetic , which had several advantages : it does n't break down , rot , or attract mold , and it could be produced in threads of various thickness . Nylon had only recently been invented , and through trial and error de Mestral eventually discovered that , when sewn under hot infrared light , nylon forms small hook shapes . However , he had yet to figure out a way to mechanize the process , and to make the looped side . Next he found that nylon thread , when woven in loops and heat - treated , retains its shape and is resilient ; however , the loops had to be cut in just the right spot so that they could be fastened and unfastened many times . On the verge of giving up , a new idea came to him . He bought a pair of shears and trimmed the tops off the loops , thus creating hooks that would match up perfectly with the loops in the pile .
