Social networks are beginning to be adopted by healthcare professionals as a means to manage institutional knowledge , disseminate peer to peer knowledge and to highlight individual physicians and institutions . The advantage of using a dedicated medical social networking site is that all the members are screened against the state licensing board list of practitioners . A new trend is emerging with social networks created to help its members with various physical and mental ailments . For people suffering from life altering diseases or chronic health conditions , companies such as HealthUnlocked and PatientsLikeMe offers their members the chance to connect with others dealing with similar issues and share experiences . For alcoholics and addicts , SoberCircle gives people in recovery the ability to communicate with one another and strengthen their recovery through the encouragement of others who can relate to their situation . DailyStrength is also a website that offers support groups for a wide array of topics and conditions , including the support topics offered by PatientsLikeMe and SoberCircle . Some social networks aim to encourage healthy lifestyles in their users . SparkPeople and HealthUnlocked offer community and social networking tools for peer support during weight loss . Fitocracy and QUENTIQ are focused on exercise , enabling users to share their own workouts and comment on those of other users . Other aspects of social network usage include the analysis of data coming from existing social networks ( such as Twitter ) to discover large crowd concentration events ( based on tweets location statistical analysis ) and disseminate the information to e.g. mobility - challenged individuals for e.g. avoiding the specific areas and optimizing their journey in an urban environment .
