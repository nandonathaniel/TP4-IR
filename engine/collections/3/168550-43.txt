With the coin now in production , Barber monitored the rate at which dies were expended , as it was the responsibility of his Engraver 's Department to supply all three mints with working dies . On March 11 , 1913 , he wrote to Landis that the dies were being used up three times faster than with the Liberty Head nickel . His department was straining to produce enough new dies to meet production . In addition , the date and denomination were the points on the coin most subject to wear , and Landis feared the value on the coin would be worn away . Barber made proposed revisions , which Fraser approved after being sent samples . These changes enlarged the legend `` FIVE CENTS '' and changed the ground on which the bison stands from a hill to flat ground . According to data compiled by numismatic historian David Lange from the National Archives , the changes to what are known as Type II nickels ( with the originals Type I ) actually decreased the die life . The new Treasury Secretary , William G. McAdoo , wanted further changes in the coin , but Fraser had moved on to other projects and was uninterested in revisiting the nickel . The thickness of the numerals in the date was gradually increased , making them more durable ; however the problem was never addressed with complete success , and even many later - date Buffalo nickels have the date worn away .
