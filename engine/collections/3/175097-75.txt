The epilogue verse 6.21 is a homage to sage Shvetashvatara for proclaiming Brahman - knowledge to ascetics . This closing credit is structurally notable because of its rarity in ancient Indian texts , as well as for its implication that the four - stage Ashrama system of Hinduism , with ascetic Sannyasa , was an established tradition by the time verse 6.21 of Shvetashvatara Upanishad was composed .
