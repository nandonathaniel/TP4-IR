Wind also limits tree growth . On coasts and isolated mountains , the tree line is often much lower than in corresponding altitudes inland and in larger , more complex mountain systems , because strong winds reduce tree growth . High winds scour away thin soils through erosion , as well as damage limbs and twigs . When high winds knock down or uproot trees , the process is known as windthrow . This is most likely on windward slopes of mountains , with severe cases generally occurring to tree stands that are 75 years or older . Plant varieties near the coast , such as the Sitka spruce and sea grape , are pruned back by wind and salt spray near the coastline .
