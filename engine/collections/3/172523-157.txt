Adapted from 500 and Euchre , highest trump is the J ♠ , known as the right bauer . Second highest trump is J ♣ , being the same color and known as the Left Bauer . The rest of the cards follow normal order . Alternatively , and similar to the above , both Jacks can be replaced with two Jokers , making them more distinctive .
