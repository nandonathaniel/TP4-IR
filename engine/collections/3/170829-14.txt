Geoneutrino detectors can detect the decay of U and Th and thus allow estimation of their contribution to the present radiogenic heat budget , while U and K is not detectable . Regardless , K is estimated to contribute 4 TW of heating . However , due to the short half - lives the decay of U and K contributed a large fraction of radiogenic heat flux to the early Earth , which was also much hotter than at present . Initial results from measuring the geoneutrino products of radioactive decay from within the Earth , a proxy for radiogenic heat , yielded a new estimate of half of the total Earth internal heat source being radiogenic , and this is consistent with previous estimates .
