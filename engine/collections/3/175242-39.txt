The Last Man Standing match is a hardcore - style match where the only way to win is by knockout . That is , a wrestler will lose the match if they are unable to answer a ten - count after being downed , similar to the knockout ruling of a boxing match . To avoid losing , the downed wrestler must be on their feet by the count of 10 , but they ca n't lose by leaving the ring for 10 - count ( ring out ) if he is still on his feet while recovering . A similar type of match is the Texas Death match ( aka . Mexican Death Match ) , where a wrestler must be pinned or forced to submit before the referee will begin the ten - count .
