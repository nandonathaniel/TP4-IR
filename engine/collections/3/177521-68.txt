Optical character recognition ( OCR ) is preferable to rekeying for converting existing text that is already written down but not in machine - readable format ( for example , a Linotype - composed book from the 1940s ) . In other words , to convert the text from an image to editable text ( that is , a string of character codes ) , a person could re-type it , or a computer could look at the image and deduce what each character is . OCR technology has already reached an impressive state ( for example , Google Book Search ) and promises more for the future .
