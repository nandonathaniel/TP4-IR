Some scholars contest the idea of a Proto - Euphratean language or one substrate language . It has been suggested by them , and others , that the Sumerian language was originally that of the hunter and fisher peoples , who lived in the marshland and the Eastern Arabia littoral region , and were part of the Arabian bifacial culture . Reliable historical records begin much later ; there are none in Sumer of any kind that have been dated before Enmebaragesi ( c. 26th century BC ) . Juris Zarins believes the Sumerians lived along the coast of Eastern Arabia , today 's Persian Gulf region , before it flooded at the end of the Ice Age .
