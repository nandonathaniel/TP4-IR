After the Seven Network cancelled their soap opera Neighbours on 12 July 1985 due to low ratings , rival network Ten picked it up and turned it into a success . A couple of years later , Seven 's head of drama , Alan Bateman , became desperate to get back into the soap market and began to work out how to launch another soap that was not a copy of Neighbours . While on a trip to Kangaroo Point , New South Wales with his family , Bateman began talking to locals who were `` up in arms '' over the construction of a foster home for children from the city . Seeing the degree of conflict the `` influx of parentless children on a tight - knit community '' was having , Bateman came away with the idea for a new serial . He explained `` Nobody in the community wanted them to move in and I began to wonder how streetwise city kids would adapt to the new lifestyle . Suddenly I thought , there is my slice of life in a community . '' Bateman began outlining the storyline and set the serial in the fictional town of Summer Bay . While Seven Network executives were unconvinced by the idea , audience research was positive . The soap opera was initially called Refuge , but the name was changed to the `` friendlier '' title of Home and Away once production began .
