The route around the island is about 60 miles ( 97 km ) and usually rowed anticlockwise . Even in good conditions , it includes a number of significant obstacles such as the Needles and the overfalls at St Catherine 's Point . The traditional start and finish were at Ryde Rowing Club ; however , other starts have been chosen in recent years to give a tidal advantage .
