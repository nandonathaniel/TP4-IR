Writing in The New Statesman in 2012 Daniel Janes commented that Shaw 's reputation had declined by the time of his 150th anniversary in 2006 but had recovered considerably . In Janes 's view , the many current revivals of Shaw 's major works showed the playwright 's `` almost unlimited relevance to our times '' . In the same year , Mark Lawson wrote in The Guardian that Shaw 's moral concerns engaged present - day audiences , and made him -- like his model , Ibsen -- one of the most popular playwrights in contemporary British theatre .
