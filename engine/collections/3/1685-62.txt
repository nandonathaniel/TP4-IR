The Great Wall concept was revived again under the Ming in the 14th century , and following the Ming army 's defeat by the Oirats in the Battle of Tumu . The Ming had failed to gain a clear upper hand over the Mongolian tribes after successive battles , and the long - drawn conflict was taking a toll on the empire . The Ming adopted a new strategy to keep the nomadic tribes out by constructing walls along the northern border of China . Acknowledging the Mongol control established in the Ordos Desert , the wall followed the desert 's southern edge instead of incorporating the bend of the Yellow River .
