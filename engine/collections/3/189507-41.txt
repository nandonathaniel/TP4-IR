Even after his debts had reached 14 million marks , Ludwig insisted on continuation of his architectural projects ; he threatened suicide if his creditors seized his palaces . In early 1886 , Ludwig asked his cabinet for a credit of 6 million marks , which was denied . In April , he followed Bismarck 's advice to apply for the money to his parliament . In June the Bavarian government decided to depose the king , who was living at Neuschwanstein at the time . On June 9 he was incapacitated , and on June 10 he had the deposition commission arrested in the gatehouse . In expectation of the commission , he alerted the gendarmerie and fire brigades of surrounding places for his protection . A second commission headed by Bernhard von Gudden arrived on the next day , and the king was forced to leave the palace that night . Ludwig was put under the supervision of von Gudden . On June 13 , both died under mysterious circumstances in the shallow shore water of Lake Starnberg near Berg Castle .
