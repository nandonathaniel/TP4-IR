Players started with five beans each from the bank . The starting player shook the bowl ; if he shook a five the other player paid him one bean , if a six five beans . If he shook either he got to shake again . If he shook anything else the turn passed to his opponent . All his winnings were handed over to a `` manager '' or `` managers '' for his side . If a player lost all of his beans another player from his side took his place and took five beans from the bank . Once all beans had been taken from the bank the game continued , but with the draw of beans now coming from the winnings of the player 's side , which were kept out of sight so that no one but the managers knew how the game was going . The game was finished when one side had won all the beans .
