Argentina experiences frequent tornados each year . Tornados occur in the South American `` tornado alley '' ( Spanish : Pasillo de los Tornados ) , which includes the provinces of Entre Ríos , Córdoba Province , Santa Fe , La Pampa and Greater Buenos Aires . The frequency of tornadoes is similar to the one found in Tornado Alley in North America . However , there is no exact number of tornado occurrences per year , owing to the lack of data . These regions have the most frequent and intense mesoscale convective systems . Tornados occur between November and April . In this region , which occupies most of the Pampas , cold air from Patagonia meets warm , humid air from Brazil with dry air coming from the Andes . When these air masses collide , they can produce intense storms , frequently becoming supercells that can produce tornados . With a larger number of convective storms , there is a higher chance that some of these storms will produce tornados . Most tornados are relatively weak and rarely cause deaths . The strongest tornado recorded in Argentina occurred in 1973 when a tornado struck San Justo , Santa Fe . The tornado was an F5 on the Fujita scale , with winds up to 500 km / h ( 310 mph ) , making it the worst tornado in Latin America and the Caribbean .
