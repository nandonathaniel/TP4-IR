Beauty and the Beast 's fourth musical number , `` Be Our Guest '' is set within the first half of the film , occurring shortly after Belle sacrifices her own freedom in return for her father 's , becoming the Beast 's prisoner . Confined to her bedroom when she , upset , stubbornly refuses to join the Beast for dinner , Belle eventually ventures into the kitchen after feeling hungry , where she is greeted by the castle 's staff of enchanted inanimate objects -- Mrs. Potts , Cogsworth and Lumiere . Upon insisting that they treat her more like a guest than a prisoner , Lumiere decides to go against the Beast 's orders and invites Belle to dinner . A `` food chorus line , '' `` Be Our Guest '' is `` a rollicking invitation to Belle from the castle staff . '' As one of the film 's most poignant , large - scale , `` all - stops - pulled production number ( s ) , '' the scene features `` dancing plates and other fanciful dinner guests '' as they `` perform for Belle , hoping to make her stay a little more comfortable . '' As the film 's heroine , Belle is served a meal in the form of `` a Broadway - quality stage show . '' Commonly regarded as the `` show - stopper '' of Beauty and the Beast , the sequence both visually and musically `` derive ( s its ) insatiable energy and excitement from the gradual accumulation of participation . '' The Washington Post observed that `` ' Be Our Guest ' '' involves `` the household gadgets enjoin ( ing ) Belle to live with them , '' comparing it heavily to the song `` Under the Sea '' from Disney 's The Little Mermaid ( 1989 ) , which was also written by Menken and Ashman . Longing to be human , servant and ma√Ætre d ' Lumiere is also of the impression that he is worth nothing unless he serves , singing , `` Life is so unnerving / For a servant who 's not serving . ''
