On October 7 , 1967 , an informant apprised the Bolivian Special Forces of the location of Guevara 's guerrilla encampment in the Yuro ravine . On the morning of October 8 , they encircled the area with two battalions numbering 1,800 soldiers and advanced into the ravine triggering a battle where Guevara was wounded and taken prisoner while leading a detachment with Sime√≥n Cuba Sarabia . Che biographer Jon Lee Anderson reports Bolivian Sergeant Bernardino Huanca 's account : that as the Bolivian Rangers approached , a twice - wounded Guevara , his gun rendered useless , threw up his arms in surrender and shouted to the soldiers : `` Do not shoot ! I am Che Guevara and I am worth more to you alive than dead . ''
