During the war years , the Labour Party was continuously active ( with some success ) in pushing for better arrangements of housing and billeting both of evacuees and of workers transferred for war services to already congested industrial areas , for fair systems of food rationing and distribution , for more effective control of prices , and for improvements in service pay and allowances . Labour also pressed hard for better provisions for the victims of air warfare , for more and better civic and industrial restaurants and canteens , and for war - time nurseries for the children of female workers .
