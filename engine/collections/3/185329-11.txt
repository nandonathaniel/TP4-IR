Beginning in the 1980s with Harry E. Claiborne , the Senate began using `` Impeachment Trial Committees '' pursuant to Senate Rule XI . These committees presided over the evidentiary phase of the trials , hearing the evidence and supervising the examination and cross-examination of witnesses . The committees would then compile the evidentiary record and present it to the Senate ; all senators would then have the opportunity to review the evidence before the chamber voted to convict or acquit . The purpose of the committees was to streamline impeachment trials , which otherwise would have taken up a great deal of the chamber 's time . Defendants challenged the use of these committees , claiming them to be a violation of their fair trial rights as well as the Senate 's constitutional mandate , as a body , to have `` sole power to try all impeachments . '' Several impeached judges sought court intervention in their impeachment proceedings on these grounds , but the courts refused to become involved due to the Constitution 's granting of impeachment and removal power solely to the legislative branch , making it a political question .
