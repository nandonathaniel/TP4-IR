In Chinese , Japanese , and Korean language computing ( CJK ) , some of the commonly used units , prefix -- unit combinations , or unit -- exponent combinations have been allocated predefined single characters taking up a full square . Unicode includes these in its CJK Compatibility and letter - like symbols sub-ranges for back compatibility , without necessarily recommending future usage . These are summarised in Unicode symbols . The cursive l , a letter - like symbol , has been used in a number of countries in addition to China and Japan as a symbol for the litre , but this is not currently recommended by any standards body .
