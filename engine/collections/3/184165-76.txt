Many of the key intellectual and political leaders operated from exile ; most Risorgimento patriots lived and published their work abroad after successive failed revolutions . Exile became a central theme of the foundational legacy of the Risorgimento as the narrative of the Italian nation fighting for independence . The exiles were deeply immersed in European ideas , and often hammered away at what Europeans saw as Italian vices , especially effeminacy and indolence . These negative stereotypes emerged from Enlightenment notions of national character that stressed the influence of the environment and history on a people 's moral predisposition . Italian exiles both challenged and embraced the stereotypes and typically presented gendered interpretations of Italy 's political `` degeneration '' . They called for a masculine response to feminine weaknesses as the basis of a national regeneration , and fashioned their image of the future Italian nation firmly in the standards of European nationalism .
