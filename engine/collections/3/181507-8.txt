Spanish tradition says the true origin of the run began in northeastern Spain during the early 14th century . While transporting cattle in order to sell them at the market , men would try to speed the process by hurrying their cattle using tactics of fear and excitement . After years of this practice , the transportation and hurrying began to turn into a competition , as young adults would attempt to race in front of the bulls and make it safely to their pens without being overtaken . When the popularity of this practice increased and was noticed more and more by the expanding population of Spanish cities , a tradition was created and stands to this day .
