On 10 February 1525 , Charles V 's younger sister Catherine of Austria married John III of Portugal , and on 11 March 1526 , Charles V married king John 's sister Isabella of Portugal . These crossed weddings strengthened the ties between the two crowns , facilitating an agreement regarding the Moluccas . It was in the interests of the emperor to avoid conflict , so that he could focus on his European policy , and the Spaniards did not know then how to get spices from the Moluccas to Europe via the eastern route . The Manila - Acapulco route was only established by Andr√©s de Urdaneta in 1565 .
