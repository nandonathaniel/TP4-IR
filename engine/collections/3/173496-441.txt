The tenth season of SpongeBob SquarePants consists of 11 episodes ( 22 segments ) , which are ordered below by production number and not their original broadcast order . It is the shortest season , lacking the usual 26 episode length . Vincent Waller said this is due to accounting and contractual issues .
