The earthquake occurred in the Pacific Ocean , off the coast of the Mexican state of Michoacán , a distance of more than 350 km ( 217 mi ) from the city , in the Cocos Plate subduction zone , specifically in a section of the fault line known as the Michoacán seismic gap . The Cocos Plate pushes against and slides under the North American Plate , primarily along the coasts of the states of Michoacán and Guerrero in Mexico . Volatile trenches along the Cocos plate generally have had seismic events 30 to 70 years before 1985 . This subduction zone outside the Michoacán gap was the source of 42 earthquakes of magnitude 7.8 or stronger in the 20th century prior to the 1985 event . However , this particular section of the subduction zone had not had an event for a much longer time . Shockwaves from the earthquake hit the mouth of the Río Balsas on the coast at 7 : 17 am and hit Mexico City , 350 km ( 217 mi ) away , two minutes later at 7 : 19 am . The 19 September quake was a multiple event with two epicenters and the second movement occurring 26 seconds after the first . Because of multiple breaks in the fault line , the event was of long duration . Ground shaking lasted more than five minutes in places along the coast and parts of Mexico City shook for three minutes , with an average shaking time of 3 -- 4 minutes . It is estimated the movement along the fault was about three meters . The main tremor was foreshadowed by a quake of magnitude 5.2 on 28 May 1985 , and was followed by two significant aftershocks : one on 20 September 1985 of magnitude 7.5 lasting thirteen seconds and the third occurring seven months later on 30 April 1986 with magnitude 7.0 lasting ten seconds . However , at least twelve other minor aftershocks were associated with the seismic event .
