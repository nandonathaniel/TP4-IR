Human spoken language makes use of the ability of almost all people in a given society to dynamically modulate certain parameters of the laryngeal voice source in a consistent manner . The most important communicative , or phonetic , parameters are the voice pitch ( determined by the vibratory frequency of the vocal folds ) and the degree of separation of the vocal folds , referred to as vocal fold adduction ( coming together ) or abduction ( separating ) .
