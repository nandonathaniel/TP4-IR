Williams is credited with helping to shape the church and state debate in England , and influencing such men as John Milton and particularly John Locke , whose work was studied closely by Thomas Jefferson , James Madison , and other designers of the U.S. Constitution . Williams theologically derived his views mainly from Scripture and his motive is seen as religious , but Jefferson 's advocation of religious liberty is seen as political and social .
