The Sahara Desert is made even drier because of two strong rain shadow effects caused by some major mountains ranges ( whose highest points can culminate to more than 4,000 meters high ) . To the northwest , the Atlas Mountains , covering the Mediterranean coast for Morocco , Algeria and Tunisia as well as to the southeast with the Ethiopian Highlands , located in Ethiopia around the Horn of Africa . On the windward side of the Atlas Mountains , the warm , moist winds blowing from the northwest off the Atlantic Ocean which contain a lot of water vapor are forced to rise , lift up and expand over the mountain range . This causes them to cool down , which causes an excess of moisture to condense into high clouds and results in heavy precipitation over the mountain range . This is known as orographic rainfall and after this process , the air is dry because it has lost most of its moisture over the Atlas Mountains . On the leeward side , the cold , dry air starts to descend and to sink and compress , making the winds warm up . This warming causes the moisture to evaporate , making clouds disappear . This prevents rainfall formation and creates desert conditions in the Sahara . The same phenomenon occurs in the Ethiopian Highlands , but this rain shadow effect is even more pronounced because this mountain range is larger , with the tropical Monsoon of South Asia coming from the Indian Ocean and from the Arabian Sea . These produce clouds and rainfall on the windward side of the mountains , but the leeward side stays rain shadowed and extremely dry . This second extreme rain shadow effect partially explains the extreme aridity of the eastern Sahara Desert , which is the driest and the sunniest place on the planet . Similar levels of aridity and dryness are only seen in the Atacama Desert , located in Chile and Peru .
