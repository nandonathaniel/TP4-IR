Saito and Osmond examine a chest of Earth items . The Academy students go to a beach for their summer trip , along with Siesta , Henrietta , and Agn√®s . They , however , are all wearing old fashioned swimsuits that cover their bodies ; Osmond asks the girls to put on the `` traditional uniforms for the ritual for the spirit of water '' . The girls change into one piece swimsuits , then bikinis , as they perform the `` rituals '' of splashing each other and smashing watermelon . The final ritual is a beach volleyball tournament where the winners will wear the true Priestess ' garments ; the boys bend the rules so Tiffania 's team advances . That night , after Saito oblivious stands Louise up for a nighttime beach walk , she discovers the boys and Osmond 's plan of putting the girls in skimpy seashell and starfish bikinis . The next morning , Montmorency excuses the girls for not showing up ( due to leg cramps and sunburn ) , but tells Saito that Louise wants to meet with him at a secluded part of the beach . Saito arrives , but is ambushed by the girls . The other guys are ambushed in a similar fashion , and as a result , they are wearing the skimpy garments while tied to rocks in the rising tide . The girls go back in the water , but are attacked by a giant octopus that appears every 30 years . Saito breaks free and rescues the girls . Later , while Saito makes octopus treats , the girls try on the seashells and stars , while the ogling boys are still tied up . As Saito arrives with Japanese style food , he inadvertently sees Louise who loses her top in the commotion .
