Soon after this , the German landings at Trondheim , Bergen , and Stavanger , as well as the skirmishes in the Oslofjord became known . Not willing to disperse too thinly due to the unknown location of the two German battleships , the Home Fleet chose to focus on nearby Bergen and dispatched an attack force . Royal Air Force reconnaissance soon reported stronger opposition than anticipated , and this , along with the possibility that the Germans might be controlling the shore defences , caused them to recall the force and instead use the aircraft carrier HMS Furious to launch torpedo bombers at the enemy ships . The attack never commenced though , as Luftwaffe bombers launched an assault of their own against the Home Fleet first . This attack sank the destroyer HMS Gurkha and then forced the Home Fleet to withdraw north when their anti-aircraft measures proved ineffective . This German air superiority in the area led the British to decide that all southern regions had to be left to submarines and the RAF , while surface vessels would concentrate on the north .
