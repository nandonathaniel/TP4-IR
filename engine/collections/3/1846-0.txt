Scoring over 10,000 runs across a playing career in any format of cricket is considered a significant achievement . In the year 2001 , Sachin Tendulkar became the first player to score 10,000 runs in ODIs , while playing a match during the bi-lateral series against Australia at home . In the chase for achieving top scores , West Indies ' Desmond Haynes retired as the most prolific run - scorer in One Day Internationals ( ODIs ) , with a total of 8,648 runs in 1994 . The record stood for four years until it was broken by India 's Mohammed Azharuddin . Azharuddin remained the top - scorer in the format until his compatriot Sachin Tendulkar passed him in October 2000 . As of August 2016 , eleven players -- from six teams that are Full members of the International Cricket Council -- have scored more than 10,000 runs in ODIs . Four of these are from Sri Lanka and three from India . The rest are one player each from Pakistan , Australia , West Indies , and South Africa . Bangladesh , England , New Zealand , and Zimbabwe are yet to have a player reach the 10,000 - run mark in this format .
