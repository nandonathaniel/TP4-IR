Coordinated contraction of ventricular cells . The ventricles must maximize systolic pressure to force blood through the circulation , so all the ventricular cells must work together . Ventricular contraction begins at the apex of the heart , progressing upwards to eject blood into the great arteries . Contraction that squeezes blood towards the exit is more efficient than a simple squeeze from all directions . Although the ventricular stimulus originates from the AV node in the wall separating the atria and ventricles , the Bundle of His conducts the signal to the apex . Depolarization propagates through cardiac muscle very rapidly . Cells of the ventricles contract nearly simultaneously . The action potentials of cardiac muscle are unusually sustained . This prevents premature relaxation , maintaining initial contraction until the entire myocardium has had time to depolarize and contract .
