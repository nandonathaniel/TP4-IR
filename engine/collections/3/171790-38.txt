Congress and the American states had no end of difficulty financing the war . In 1775 there was at most 12 million dollars in gold in the colonies , not nearly enough to cover existing transactions , let alone on a major war . The British made the situation much worse by imposing a tight blockade on every American port , which cut off almost all imports and exports . One partial solution was to rely on volunteer support from militiamen , and donations from patriotic citizens . Another was to delay actual payments , pay soldiers and suppliers in depreciated currency , and promise it would be made good after the war . Indeed , in 1783 the soldiers and officers were given land grants to cover the wages they had earned but had not been paid during the war . Not until 1781 , when Robert Morris was named Superintendent of Finance of the United States , did the national government have a strong leader in financial matters . Morris used a French loan in 1782 to set up the private Bank of North America to finance the war . Seeking greater efficiency , Morris reduced the civil list , saved money by using competitive bidding for contracts , tightened accounting procedures , and demanded the federal government 's full share of money and supplies from the states .
