The Greek painter Apelles of Kos , a contemporary of Praxiteles , produced the panel painting Aphrodite Anadyomene ( Aphrodite Rising from the Sea ) . According to Athenaeus , Apelles was inspired to paint the painting after watching the courtesan Phryne take off her clothes , untie her hair , and bathe naked in the sea at Eleusis . The painting was displayed in the Asclepeion on the island of Kos . The Aphrodite Anadyomene went unnoticed for centuries , but Pliny the Elder records that , in his own time , it was regarded as Apelles 's most famous work .
