A 2007 clinical report of the American Academy of Pediatrics concluded that the benefit of ABA - based interventions in autism spectrum disorders ( ASDs ) `` has been well documented '' and that `` children who receive early intensive behavioral treatment have been shown to make substantial , sustained gains in IQ , language , academic performance , and adaptive behavior as well as some measures of social behavior '' . Researchers from the MIND Institute published an evidence - based review of comprehensive treatment approaches in 2008 . On the basis of `` the strength of the findings from the four best - designed , controlled studies '' , they were of the opinion that one ABA - based approach ( the Lovaas technique created by Ole Ivar LÃ¸vaas ) is `` well - established '' for improving intellectual performance of young children with ASD . A 2009 review of psycho - educational interventions for children with autism whose mean age was six years or less at intake found that five high - quality ( `` Level 1 '' or `` Level 2 '' ) studies assessed ABA - based treatments . On the basis of these and other studies , the author concluded that ABA is `` well - established '' and is `` demonstrated effective in enhancing global functioning in pre-school children with autism when treatment is intensive and carried out by trained therapists '' . However , the review committee also concluded that `` there is a great need for more knowledge about which interventions are most effective '' . A 2009 paper included a descriptive analysis , an effect size analysis , and a meta - analysis of 13 reports published from 1987 to 2007 of early intensive behavioral intervention ( EIBI , a form of ABA - based treatment with origins in the Lovaas technique ) for autism . It determined that EIBI 's effect sizes were `` generally positive '' for IQ , adaptive behavior , expressive language , and receptive language . The paper did note limitations of its findings including the lack of published comparisons between EIBI and other `` empirically validated treatment programs '' . In a 2009 systematic review of 11 studies published from 1987 to 2007 , the researchers wrote `` there is strong evidence that EIBI is effective for some , but not all , children with autism spectrum disorders , and there is wide variability in response to treatment '' . Furthermore , any improvements are likely to be greatest in the first year of intervention . A 2009 meta - analysis of nine studies published from 1987 to 2007 concluded that EIBI has a `` large '' effect on full - scale intelligence and a `` moderate '' effect on adaptive behavior in autistic children . In 2011 , investigators from Vanderbilt University under contract with the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality performed a comprehensive review of the scientific literature on ABA - based and other therapies for autism spectrum disorders ; the ABA - based therapies included the UCLA / Lovaas method and the Early Start Denver Model ( the latter developed by Sally Rogers and Geraldine Dawson ) . They concluded that `` both approaches were associated with ... improvements in cognitive performance , language skills , and adaptive behavior skills '' . However , they also concluded that `` the strength of evidence ... is low '' , `` many children continue to display prominent areas of impairment '' , `` subgroups may account for a majority of the change '' , there is `` little evidence of practical effectiveness or feasibility beyond research studies '' , and the published studies `` used small samples , different treatment approaches and duration , and different outcome measurements '' .
