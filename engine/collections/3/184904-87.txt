Urban workers formed the Bolshevik base of support , so the exodus posed a serious problem . Factory production severely slowed or halted . Factories lacked 30,000 workers in 1919 . To survive , city dwellers sold personal valuables , made artisan craft goods for sale or barter , and planted gardens . The acute need for food drove them to obtain 50 % -- 60 % of food through illegal trading ( see meshochnik ) . The shortage of cash caused the black market to use a barter system , which was inefficient .
