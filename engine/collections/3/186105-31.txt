The use of symbols to replace words dates back to at least the late medieval era when Johannes Widman , writing in German in 1486 , used the symbols `` + '' and `` âˆ’ '' to represent `` addition '' and `` subtraction '' . In the early 1800s Berzelius introduced a symbolic notation for the chemical elements derived from the elements ' Latin names . Typically , `` Na '' was used for the element sodium ( Latin : natrium ) and H O for water .
