Later , during the American Civil War , California State volunteers replaced Federal troops and won the ongoing Bald Hills War and the Owens Valley Indian War and engaged in minor actions against hostiles in Northern California . California and Oregon State volunteer garrisons in Nevada , Oregon , Idaho , Utah , New Mexico and the Arizona Territories also engaged conflicts with the Apache , Cheyenne , Goshute , Navajo , Paiute , Shoshone , Sioux and Ute Indians from 1862 to 1866 . Following the Civil War , California was mostly pacified , but federal troops replaced the volunteers and again took up the struggle against Native Americans in the remote regions of the Mojave Desert , and in the northeast of the state against the Snakes ( 1864 -- 1868 ) and Modocs ( 1872 -- 1873 ) .
