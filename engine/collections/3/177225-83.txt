Houses documents and items seized by the national troops and their allies during and at the end of the Spanish Civil War . While over the entire postwar its basic objective was to preserve the information related to organizations and peoples potentially opposing the Franco regime , and therefore use this information for repressive , since the return of democracy this building would become one of the most important archives that existed in Spain to investigate the historical period of the Second Republic . Many of the documents and objects that still remain in the archive are related to the Freemasonry , including several furniture that has been rebuilt a Masonic Lodge .
