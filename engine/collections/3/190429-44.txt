The French Grand Prix returned to the Reims - Gueux circuit for 1938 and 1939 , where the Silver Arrows continued their domination of Grand Prix racing . The Reims - Gueux circuit had its straights widened and facilities updated for the 1938 race . But when World War II began , the French Grand Prix did not come back until 1947 , where it was held at the one - time Parilly circuit near Lyon , a race that was marred by an accident involving Pierre Levegh crashing into and killing 3 spectators . After that , Grand Prix racing returned to Reims - Gueux , where another manufacturer -- Alfa Romeo -- would dominate the event for 4 years . 1950 was the first year of the Formula One World Championship , but all the Formula One - regulated races were held in Europe . The race was won by Argentine Juan Manuel Fangio , who also won the next year 's race -- the longest Formula One race ever held in terms of distance covered , totalling 373 miles .
