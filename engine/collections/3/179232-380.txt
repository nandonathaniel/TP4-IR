Anglo - Saxon is the term usually used to describe the peoples living in the south and east of Great Britain from the early 5th century AD . Benedictine monk Bede identified them as the descendants of three Germanic tribes : the Angles , the Saxons , and the Jutes , from the Jutland peninsula and Lower Saxony ( German : Niedersachsen , Germany ) . The Angles may have come from Angeln , and Bede wrote their nation came to Britain , leaving their land empty . They spoke closely related Germanic dialects . The Anglo - Saxons knew themselves as the `` Englisc , '' from which the word `` English '' derives .
