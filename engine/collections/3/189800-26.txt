Bring Me the Horizon recorded their second studio album , Suicide Season , in Sweden with producer Fredrik Nordström . He was unimpressed with their first album and was initially absent from the recording sessions unless he needed to be there . Nordström later heard the new sound they were experimenting with during a recording session and became very involved in the record . It was promoted virally in the weeks before its release with the promotional tag line `` September is Suicide Season . '' To promote Suicide Season the band embarked on their first headline tour of the United States , as well as appearing at the 2008 Warped Tour . In May 2008 , Bring Me the Horizon was the main supporting band on I Killed the Prom Queen 's farewell Australian tour with The Ghost Inside and The Red Shore .
