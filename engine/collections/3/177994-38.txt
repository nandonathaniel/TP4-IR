Led by Baylor and West at 38.3 and 30.8 ppg respectively , the Lakers improved to 54 -- 26 in 1961 -- 62 , and made the finals . In a game five victory , Baylor grabbed 22 rebounds and set the still - standing NBA record for points in a finals game with 61 , despite fouling out of the game . The Lakers , however , lost to the Celtics by three points in overtime of game seven . Frank Selvy , after making two jumpers in the final 40 seconds to tie the game , missed a potential game - winning 18 foot jump shot in regulation , a miss which he said in June 2010 still haunted him more than 40 years later .
