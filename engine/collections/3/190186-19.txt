The autonomic nervous system controls involuntary responses to regulate physiological functions . The brain and spinal cord from the central nervous system are connected with organs that have smooth muscle , such as the heart , bladder , and other cardiac , exocrine , and endocrine related organs , by ganglionic neurons . The most notable physiological effects from autonomic activity are pupil constriction and dilation , and salivation of saliva . The autonomic nervous system is always activated , but is either in the sympathetic or parasympathetic state . Depending on the situation , one state can overshadow the other , resulting in a release of different kinds of neurotransmitters . There is a lesser known division of the autonomic nervous system known as the enteric nervous system . Located only around the digestive tract , this system allows for local control without input from the sympathetic or the parasympathetic branches , though it can still receive and respond to signals from the rest of the body . The enteric system is responsible for various functions related to gastrointestinal system .
