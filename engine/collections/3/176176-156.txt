The Royal Prerogative is not unlimited ; this was established in the Case of Proclamations ( 1610 ) , which confirmed that no new prerogative can be created and that Parliament can abolish individual prerogatives . However , as part of Parliamentary Sovereignty , Parliament could create new prerogatives if it so wished regardless . Parliament has the power to remove powers from the Royal Prerogative : this was done in the Fixed - term Parliaments Act 2011 which removed the Royal Prerogative to dissolve Parliament . However , the monarch 's consent is required before Parliament may pass legislation removing such powers : this was seen when the second reading of the Military Action Against Iraq ( Parliamentary Approval ) Bill , which would have removed the monarch 's ability to authorize military action without Parliamentary approval , had to be abandoned because the monarch ( on the advice of her government ) refused to grant such consent .
