Jesus sent only John and Peter into the city to make the preparation for the final Passover meal ( the Last Supper ) . At the meal itself , the `` disciple whom Jesus loved '' sat next to Jesus . It was customary to lie along upon couches at meals , and this disciple leaned on Jesus . Tradition identifies this disciple as Saint John . After the arrest of Jesus , Peter and the `` other disciple '' ( according to Sacred Tradition ) , John followed him into the palace of the high - priest .
