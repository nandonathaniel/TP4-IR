The plot of the game is different from the film ; instead of Conrad unlocking the Cat 's Crate , Larry unlocks it and steals the Lock . Playing as the Cat , the player must go through thirteen levels through the transformed house and chase down Larry , who is collecting the magic released from the Crate for himself , and defeat him to get the Lock ( called the `` Crablock '' in - game ) back and re-lock the Crate before the children 's mother returns home .
