Conservation grazing is the use of grazing animals to help improve the biodiversity of a site . Due to their hardy and thrifty nature , rare and native breeds are often used in conservation grazing . In some cases , to re-establish traditional hay meadows , cattle such as the English Longhorn and Highland ( which happen to be rare breeds ) are used to provide low intensity grazing .
