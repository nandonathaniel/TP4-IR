Laak ( 40,222 inhabitants ) is the smallest district of the city , southeast of its centre , for the most part , built in the 20th and 21st century . The area used to be part of Rijswijk , until the municipality of The Hague bought the land in 1844 . The Hollands Spoor railway station and The Hague University are located here , as well as the site of the planned mixed use development Nieuw Binckhorst .
