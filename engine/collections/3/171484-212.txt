The main characteristic of these scripts was their writing style . The letters in most of these manuscripts are heavy - looking , relatively short and horizontally elongated . The slanted isolated form of the alif that was present in the Umayyad period completely disappeared and was replaced by a straight shaft with a pronounced right - sided foot , set at a considerable distance from the following letter . Also , unlike the Hijazi scripts , these are often richly illuminated in gold and other colors . Another difference is that sura headings are clearly marked and enclosed in rectangular panels with marginal vignettes or palmettes protruding into the outer margins . These Qurans of the early Abbasid period were also bound in wooden boards , structured like a box enclosed on all sides with a movable upper cover that was fastened to the rest of the structure with leather thongs .
