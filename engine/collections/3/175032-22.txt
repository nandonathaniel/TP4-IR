Later on , Lupin 's Defence Against the Dark Arts sessions prove far better than those of Gilderoy Lockhart 's ( Harry 's uselessly vain ex-teacher ) . They have a fun lesson on Boggarts ( see Magical Creatures in Harry Potter ) and then learn about more Dark Creatures . When Lupin supposedly falls ill , the much hated Potions Master Professor Snape temporarily takes over teaching Defence Against the Dark Arts and torments the class , much to their dismay .
