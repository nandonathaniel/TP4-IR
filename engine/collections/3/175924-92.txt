Service : The service again had a tableside appetizer , this time of geoduck chowder served by Aaron and Kalen . The men had another poor service ; despite a good performance by Bryant on the appetizers , Steve made several mistakes on the fish station , serving up raw and overcooked fish and then the duo of Fernando and Sterling put up a poor performance on the meat station , repeatedly getting their times wrong and undercooking the meat . The team managed to get some entrees out , but progress was far too slow for Chef Ramsay 's liking and he threw the men out after Sterling revealed that he was nearly five minutes behind on a pork loin . The women , meanwhile , were unable to repeat their performance of the previous episode ; Janai got the team off to a disastrous start by constantly serving up bland , overcooked risottos and refusing to give the other women times , which caused Denine to serve undercooked scallops . Ramsay ordered all the women into the pantry to regroup , after which they finished the appetizers and Jennifer and La Tasha were able to get the meat entrees out perfectly . However , Denine kept making mistakes on the fish station , which caused Ramsay to throw the whole team out . Ramsay was angry that the blue team had performed poorly again , but especially disappointed that the women had fallen apart so quickly after the previous service . As a result , each team was told to nominate two chefs for elimination .
