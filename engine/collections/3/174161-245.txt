Shinto is the largest religion in Japan , practiced by nearly 80 % of the population , yet only a small percentage of these identify themselves as `` Shintoists '' in surveys . This is due to the fact that `` Shinto '' has different meanings in Japan : most of the Japanese attend Shinto shrines and beseech kami without belonging to Shinto organisations , and since there are no formal rituals to become a member of folk Shinto , Shinto membership is often estimated counting those who join organised Shinto sects . Shinto has 100,000 shrines and 78,890 priests in the country . Buddhism first arrived in Japan in the 6th century ; it was introduced in the year 538 or 552 from the kingdom of Baekje in Korea .
