Miss Ada Cackle / Agatha Cackle ( Clare Higgins ) : Ada Cackle is the headmistress of Cackle 's Academy , while Agatha is her twin sister . While Ada is a kind woman who gave Mildred a chance despite her unconventional background - although she contemplated expelling Mildred in `` Maud 's Big Mistake '' when the school 's memories were altered so that nobody remembered Mildred and Maud were friends and it therefore appeared that Mildred had nobody to temper her mistakes - Agatha favours a more hardline approach ; Agatha even attempted to stage a coup of the school during Selection Day that was only just thwarted by Mildred 's unconventional approach . During `` The Mists of Time '' , Mildred discovered a scroll that revealed that technically Agatha should have been headmistress as she is the elder sister ( albeit by only thirteen minutes ) , but while visiting the past , Ada spoke with their mother and learned that she made the switch as she recognized that Ada would be the better headmistress . Agatha used this to stage a coup of the school in the first season finale after tricking Esmeralda Hallow into giving Agatha her magic , trapping Ada and Miss Hardbroom in a painting and turning Miss Bat and Mr Rowan - Webb as frogs , Esmeralda as a trophy and Ethel , Maud and Enid into cakes , but this coup was thwarted by Mildred - who had been expelled just after the coup to protect her and summoned back by Ethel - who helped rally the students to stand up against Agatha and cancel her spell to destroy the academy .
