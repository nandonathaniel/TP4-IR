Jiang Zemin , then Party Secretary of Shanghai , was promoted to General Secretary of the Communist Party . Jiang 's decisive actions in Shanghai involving the World Economic Herald and his having prevented deadly violence in the city won him support from party elders in Beijing . Having put the new leadership team in place and recognising his weakened position , Deng Xiaoping himself also bowed out of the party leadership -- at least officially -- by resigning his last leadership position as Chairman of the Central Military Commission later that year . He kept a low profile until 1992 . According to diplomatic cables de-classified by Canada , the then Swiss ambassador informed Canadian diplomats in confidence that over several months following the massacre , `` every member of the Politburo Standing Committee has approached him about transferring very significant amounts of money to Swiss bank accounts '' .
