Prior to the IPO , several investors set price targets for the company . On May 14 , before the offering price was announced , Sterne Agee analyst Arvind Bhatia pegged the company at $46 in an interview with The Street . The interviewer cautioned Bhatia against what she perceived as Bhatia 's low valuation , suggesting the stock could rise to `` 60 , 70 , 80 dollars '' and could shoot up to $60 on the first day of trading . On May 17 , the day before the offering , analyst Jim Krapfel of Morningstar suggested that only a 50 % or better increase on the first day would be seen positively ; `` anything under that would be underwhelming . '' Lee Simmons of Dun & Bradstreet predicted more modest first - day gains , in the range of 10 to 20 % . No analysts Reuters interviewed projected a first - day decrease . Others were less optimistic . Much of Wall Street expressed concerns over what it saw as a high valuation . Citing the price - to - earnings ratio of 108 for 2011 , critics stated that the company would have to undergo `` almost ridiculous financial growth ( for the valuation ) to make sense . '' Other companies trade at far lower ratios , although there are notable exceptions . Writers at TechCrunch expressed similar skepticism , stating , `` That 's a big multiple to live up to , and ( Facebook ) will likely need to add bold new revenue streams to justify the mammoth valuation '' .
