Based on performance during the year , an umpire may advance in classification when a position opens in - season or during the off - season . Umpire Development holds an annual evaluation course every year in March to evaluate rookie umpires . Participants are normally the best students from the two professional umpire schools ( one owned and operated by the same entity ) . The top students who pass the evaluation course are recommended for the first openings in the Rookie and short season leagues .
