Damage - prediction software was used to evaluate possible tile and RCC damage . The tool for predicting tile damage was known as `` Crater '' , described by several NASA representatives in press briefings as not actually a software program but rather a statistical spreadsheet of observed past flight events and effects . The `` Crater '' tool predicted severe penetration of multiple tiles by the impact if it struck the TPS tile area , but NASA engineers downplayed this . It had been shown that the model overstated damage from small projectiles , and engineers believed that the model would also overstate damage from larger Spray - On Foam Insulation ( SOFI ) impacts . The program used to predict RCC damage was based on small ice impacts the size of cigarette butts , not larger SOFI impacts , as the ice impacts were the only recognized threats to RCC panels up to that point . Under one of 15 predicted SOFI impact paths , the software predicted an ice impact would completely penetrate the RCC panel . Engineers downplayed this , too , believing that impacts of the less dense SOFI material would result in less damage than ice impacts . In an e-mail exchange , NASA managers questioned whether the density of the SOFI could be used as justification for reducing predicted damage . Despite engineering concerns about the energy imparted by the SOFI material , NASA managers ultimately accepted the rationale to reduce predicted damage of the RCC panels from possible complete penetration to slight damage to the panel 's thin coating .
