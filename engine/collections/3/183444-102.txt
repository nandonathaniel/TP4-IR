In 2008 , Eurosport secured a multi-year deal to show the entire race , including the qualifying and the motorcycle race . Every hour of the 2008 race was broadcast in segments on the main channel and on Eurosport 2 , but in recent years , a couple of hours were missed due to scheduling clashes with other sporting events . In addition , Eurosport provided live streaming on its website to subscribers . Since 2009 , however , Eurosport and Eurosport 2 have covered all the action , and beginning in 2018 , Eurosport gained United States broadcast rights for the World Endurance Championship for the race only on Velocity , a channel also owned by Eurosport 's parent company . Qualifying and practices aired on a direct - to - consumer streaming platform from Motor Trend magazine . In Australia in 2012 , Ten Sport showed the race live and in full online . The FIA WEC shows the race live via a subscription service for the whole 24 hrs on their website .
