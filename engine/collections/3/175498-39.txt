On March 15 , 2008 , Pope Benedict XVI approved a decree recognizing McGivney 's `` heroic virtue '' , significantly advancing the priest 's process toward sainthood . McGivney may now be referred to as the `` Venerable Servant of God '' . If the cause is successful , he would be the first priest born in the United States to be canonized as a saint .
