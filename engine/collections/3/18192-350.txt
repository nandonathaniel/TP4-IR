Puerto Rico experienced a recession from 2006 to 2011 , interrupted by 4 quarters of economic growth , and entered into recession again in 2013 , following growing fiscal imbalance and the expiration of the IRS Section 936 corporate incentives that the U.S. Internal Revenue Code had applied to Puerto Rico . This IRS section was critical to the economy , as it established tax exemptions for U.S. corporations that settled in Puerto Rico , and allowed their insular subsidiaries to send their earnings to the parent corporation at any time , without paying federal tax on corporate income . Puerto Rico has surprisingly been able to maintain a relatively low inflation in the past decade while maintaining a purchasing power parity per capita higher than 80 % of the rest of the world .
