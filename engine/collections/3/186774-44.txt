When The New York Times began publishing its series , President Richard Nixon became incensed . His words to National Security Advisor Henry Kissinger included `` People have got ta be put to the torch for this sort of thing ... '' and `` Let 's get the son - of - a-bitch in jail . '' After failing to get The New York Times to stop publishing , Attorney General John Mitchell and President Nixon obtained a federal court injunction that The New York Times cease publication of excerpts . The newspaper appealed and the case began working through the court system . On June 18 , 1971 , The Washington Post began publishing its own series . Ben Bagdikian , a Post editor , had obtained portions of the papers from Ellsberg . That day the Post received a call from the Assistant Attorney General , William Rehnquist , asking them to stop publishing . When the Post refused , the U.S. Justice Department sought another injunction . The U.S. District court judge refused , and the government appealed . On June 26 , 1971 , the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to take both cases , merging them into New York Times Co. v. United States , 403 U.S. 713 ( 1971 ) . On June 30 , 1971 , the Supreme Court held in a 6 -- 3 decision that the injunctions were unconstitutional prior restraints and that the government had not met the burden of proof required . The justices wrote nine separate opinions , disagreeing on significant substantive issues . While it was generally seen as a victory for those who claim the First Amendment enshrines an absolute right to free speech , many felt it a lukewarm victory , offering little protection for future publishers when claims of national security were at stake .
