ampere electric current Prior ( 1881 ) : A tenth of the electromagnetic CGS unit of current . The ( CGS ) electromagnetic unit of current is that current , flowing in an arc 1 cm long of a circle 1 cm in radius , that creates a field of one oersted at the centre . Current ( 1946 ) : The constant current which , if maintained in two straight parallel conductors of infinite length , of negligible circular cross-section , and placed 1 m apart in vacuum , would produce between these conductors a force equal to 6993200000000000000 ♠ 2 × 10 newtons per metre of length .
