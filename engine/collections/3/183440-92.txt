Puritans believed in the active existence of demonic forces , as did almost all Christians of this period . Puritan pastors undertook exorcisms for demonic possession in some high - profile cases , and believed in some allegations of witchcraft . Exorcist John Darrell was supported by Arthur Hildersham in the case of Thomas Darling . Samuel Harsnett , a skeptic on witchcraft and possession , attacked Darrell . However , Harsnett was in the minority , and many clergy , not only Puritans , believed in witchcraft and possession . The possession case of Richard Dugdale was taken up by ejected nonconformist Thomas Jollie and other local ministers in 1689 .
