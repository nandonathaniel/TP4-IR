Since the first stars began to form , the Milky Way has grown through both galaxy mergers ( particularly early in the Milky Way 's growth ) and accretion of gas directly from the Galactic halo . The Milky Way is currently accreting material from two of its nearest satellite galaxies , the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds , through the Magellanic Stream . Direct accretion of gas is observed in high - velocity clouds like the Smith Cloud . However , properties of the Milky Way such as stellar mass , angular momentum , and metallicity in its outermost regions suggest it has undergone no mergers with large galaxies in the last 10 billion years . This lack of recent major mergers is unusual among similar spiral galaxies ; its neighbour the Andromeda Galaxy appears to have a more typical history shaped by more recent mergers with relatively large galaxies .
