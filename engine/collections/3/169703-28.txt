The game was developed by Ubisoft Montreal and Ubisoft Toronto with Ubisoft Kiev , Ubisoft Shanghai , and Ubisoft Reflections offering assistance . Dan Hay , who served as lead producer for Far Cry 3 , was the lead director , with writing led by Drew Holmes , who had previously worked on BioShock Infinite and its downloadable content . The game continue the series ' practice of using the Dunia Engine , a modified version of the CryEngine . The team chose Montana as the game 's setting , as the state lies on the frontier of the United States . To create a realistic environment , the development team visited Montana for fourteen days to collect information regarding its biomes , environment , and the `` self - reliant '' nature of the locals , who do not want any authority or outsider to intervene in their life . The development team had previously carried out a similar research excursion to Nepal during development of Far Cry 4 . As the development team was no longer satisfied with having one core antagonist in each game , the cast of antagonists was significantly expanded .
