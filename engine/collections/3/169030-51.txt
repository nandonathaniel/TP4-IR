O'Brien showed a portion of the unfinished script to Australian director Jim Sharman , who decided to direct it at the small experimental space Upstairs at the Royal Court Theatre , Sloane Square , Chelsea , London , which was used as a project space for new work . O'Brien had appeared briefly in Andrew Lloyd Webber 's Jesus Christ Superstar , directed by Sharman , and the two also worked together in Sam Shepard 's The Unseen Hand . Sharman would bring in production designer Brian Thomson . The original creative team was then rounded out by costume designer Sue Blane , musical director Richard Hartley , and stage producer Michael White , who was brought in to produce . As the musical went into rehearsal , the working title , They Came from Denton High , was changed just before previews at the suggestion of Sharman to The Rocky Horror Show .
