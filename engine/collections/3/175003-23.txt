is the sum of all rates of excited state decay . Other rates of excited state decay are caused by mechanisms other than photon emission and are , therefore , often called `` non-radiative rates '' , which can include : dynamic collisional quenching , near - field dipole - dipole interaction ( or resonance energy transfer ) , internal conversion , and intersystem crossing . Thus , if the rate of any pathway changes , both the excited state lifetime and the fluorescence quantum yield will be affected .
