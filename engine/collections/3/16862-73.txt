The need to create work for the unemployed during the Great Depression , the desire for rural electrification , and the desire to control the annual spring floods on the Tennessee River drove the federal government 's creation of the Tennessee Valley Authority , the nation 's largest public utility , in 1933 . The TVA affected the lives of nearly all Tennesseans . The agency was created mainly through the persistence of Senator George Norris of Nebraska . Headquartered in Knoxville , it was charged with the task of planning the total development of the Tennessee River Valley . TVA sought to do this by building hydroelectric dams , constructing 20 between 1933 and 1951 , as well as electricity - producing coal - fired power plants .
