After two decades of fighting and four failed tries at peace talks , including the unsuccessful deployment of the Indian Army , the Indian Peace Keeping Force from 1987 to 1990 , a lasting negotiated settlement to the conflict appeared possible when a cease - fire was declared in December 2001 , and a ceasefire agreement signed with international mediation in 2002 . However , limited hostilities renewed in late 2005 and the conflict began to escalate until the government launched a number of major military offensives against the LTTE beginning in July 2006 , driving the LTTE out of the entire Eastern province of the island . The LTTE then declared they would `` resume their freedom struggle to achieve statehood '' .
