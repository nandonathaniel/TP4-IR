Many species can see light with frequencies outside the human `` visible spectrum '' . Bees and many other insects can detect ultraviolet light , which helps them to find nectar in flowers . Plant species that depend on insect pollination may owe reproductive success to ultraviolet `` colors '' and patterns rather than how colorful they appear to humans . Birds , too , can see into the ultraviolet ( 300 -- 400 nm ) , and some have sex - dependent markings on their plumage that are visible only in the ultraviolet range . Many animals that can see into the ultraviolet range , however , can not see red light or any other reddish wavelengths . For example , bees ' visible spectrum ends at about 590 nm , just before the orange wavelengths start . Birds , however , can see some red wavelengths , although not as far into the light spectrum as humans . It is an incorrect popular belief that the common goldfish is the only animal that can see both infrared and ultraviolet light , their color vision extends into the ultraviolet but not the infrared .
