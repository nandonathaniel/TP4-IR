There is no evidence of any official decision to universally disallow translations following the incident at Metz until the Council of Trent , at which time the Reformation threatened the Catholic Church , and the rediscovery of the Greek New Testament presented new problems for translators . However , some specific translations were condemned , and regional bans were imposed during the Albigensian Crusade : Toulouse in 1229 , Taragona in 1234 and Beziers in 1246 . Pope Gregory IX incorporated Innocent III 's letter into his Decretals and instituted these bans presumably with the Cathars in mind as well as the Waldensians , who continued to preach using their own translations , spreading into Spain and Italy , as well as the Holy Roman Empire . Production of Wycliffite Bibles would later be officially banned in England at the Oxford Synod in the face of Lollard anticlerical sentiment , but the ban was not strictly enforced and since owning earlier copies was not illegal , books made after the ban are often simply inscribed with a date prior to 1409 to avoid seizure .
