When a film is highly exploitable as a commercial property , its ancillary revenues can dwarf its income from direct film sales . The Lion King earned over $2 billion in box - office and home video sales , but this pales in comparison to the $6 billion earned at box offices around the world by the stage adaptation . Merchandising can be extremely lucrative too : The Lion King also sold $3 billion of merchandise , while Pixar 's Cars -- which earned $462 million in theatrical revenues and was only a modest hit by comparison to other Pixar films -- generated global merchandise sales of over $8 billion in the five years after its 2006 release . Pixar also had another huge hit with Toy Story 3 , which generated almost $10 billion in merchandise retail sales in addition to the $1 billion it earned at the box office .
