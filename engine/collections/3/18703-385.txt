In the 2011 -- 12 season , the Lakers under head coach Mike Brown made the playoffs with a 41 -- 25 record , but lost to the Thunder in the conference semifinals . The following offseason , the Lakers added perennial All - Stars Dwight Howard and Steve Nash , but they only managed a 45 -- 37 mark , and were swept by the San Antonio Spurs in the first round . The Lakers then missed the playoffs for the first time since 2005 , with Kobe Bryant playing only six games due to injuries .
