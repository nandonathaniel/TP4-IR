The amount of testosterone synthesized is regulated by the hypothalamic -- pituitary -- testicular axis ( see figure to the right ) . When testosterone levels are low , gonadotropin - releasing hormone ( GnRH ) is released by the hypothalamus , which in turn stimulates the pituitary gland to release FSH and LH . These latter two hormones stimulate the testis to synthesize testosterone . Finally , increasing levels of testosterone through a negative feedback loop act on the hypothalamus and pituitary to inhibit the release of GnRH and FSH / LH , respectively .
