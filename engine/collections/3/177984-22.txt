The Gilded Age ( 1877 -- 1901 ) was marked by Republican dominance of Congress -- and the Presidency -- except in the early years , and some of the mid-years of the Gilded Age - , despite the Democratic lock on the Solid South . The Republican Party , however , would regain control over the US House of Representatives in the 1880 election , as support for the Republican Party 's tariff spread among the general public ; the Panic of 1873 had also ended for the US in 1879 , with the start of the vast immigration into the US that lasted until 1930 . State legislatures continued to elect senators , which meant that the most powerful politicians in the state vied for control of the legislature in order to win election to the Senate . The Democrats , however , retained control of the United States Senate in the 1880 US Senate election , as Virginia 's Readjuster Party member William Mahone and Illinois ' Independent Party member David Davis were both elected to the US Senate . Both men chose to caucus with the Democrats , thus giving the Democratic Party a 39 -- 37 control of the Senate during the 47th United States Congress .
