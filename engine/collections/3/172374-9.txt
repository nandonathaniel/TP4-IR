When the Alamo Cenotaph was created by Pompeo Coppini in 1939 , the 187 defender names on the monument came from the research of Amelia Williams , considered the leading Alamo authority of her day . Her work is still used by some as a benchmark , although skepticism has been voiced . Lindley 's 2003 Alamo Traces : New Evidence and New Conclusions is the result of his 15 - year study of the battle , and upended much of what was previously accepted as fact . He devoted a chapter to deconstructing Williams ' research as `` misrepresentation , alteration , and fabrication of data '' , criticizing her sole reliance on the military land grants without checking through the muster lists to identify the combatants . In lieu of service pay , the cash - poor Republic of Texas adopted the system of military land grants . Issuance was dependent upon the military muster lists and either the veterans or their heirs filing a claim , a process that required an upfront fee to complete . Lacking a completed claim , proof of service would appear only on a muster list .
