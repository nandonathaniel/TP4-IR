After winning the 2003 World Series , the Marlins entered 2004 with high hopes and a retooled roster . Retaining a core of stars from their title team and hoping that newly acquired 1B Hee - seop Choi would emerge , the Marlins fell short of reaching the postseason , but they posted the third winning season in franchise history , boasting an 83 - 79 record . During the season , the Marlins were to make one of the biggest trades in club history as Los Angeles got P Brad Penny , 1B Choi and Double - A left - hander Bill Murphy in exchange for P Guillermo Mota , C Paul Lo Duca and OF Juan Encarnación . Pitchers Carl Pavano and Armando Benítez turned in record - setting performances . Pavano went 18 - 8 with a 3.30 ERA , and his 18 wins established a season high by a Marlin . Benitez became the club 's season saves leader with 47 ( in 51 saves attempts ) . Pavano , Benitez , Mike Lowell and Miguel Cabrera each enjoyed All - Star seasons , with Cabrera belting 33 homers ( second-most ever in a season by a Marlin ) while driving in 112 runs .
