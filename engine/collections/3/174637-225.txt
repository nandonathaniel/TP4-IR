Proxy is defined by supreme courts as `` an authority or power to do a certain thing . '' A person can confer on his proxy any power which he himself possesses . He may also give him secret instructions as to voting upon particular questions . But a proxy is ineffectual when it is contrary to law or public policy . Where the proxy is duly appointed and he acts within the scope of the proxy , the person authorizing the proxy is bound by his appointee 's acts , including his errors or mistakes . When the appointer sends his appointee to a meeting , the proxy may do anything at that meeting necessary to a full and complete exercise of the appointer 's right to vote at such meeting . This includes the right to vote to take the vote by ballot , or to adjourn ( and , hence , he may also vote on other ordinary parliamentary motions , such as to refer , postpone , reconsider , etc. , when necessary or when deemed appropriate and advantageous to the overall object or purpose of the proxy ) .
