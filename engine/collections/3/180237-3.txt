Delhi and Puducherry ( Pondicherry ) operate somewhat differently from the other five . Delhi and Puducherry were given partial statehood and Delhi was redefined as the National Capital Territory of Delhi ( NCT ) and incorporated into a larger area known as the National Capital Region ( NCR ) . Delhi and Puducherry have an elected legislative assembly and an executive council of ministers with partially state - like function .
