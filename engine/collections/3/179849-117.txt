In 1986 , critic Robin Wood examined what he viewed as the film 's homosexual subtext . In the film 's central `` male love affair '' Mike supposedly represents the powers of control and repression , whereas Nick stands for release and liberation . According to Wood , `` Nick both is and knows himself to be in love with Mike and Mike reciprocates that love but ca n't admit it , even to himself '' . In the end , Wood argues that Nick shoots himself because `` he has recognized that Mike offers nothing but a return to repression '' .
