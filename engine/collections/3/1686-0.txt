Habitat fragmentation describes the emergence of discontinuities ( fragmentation ) in an organism 's preferred environment ( habitat ) , causing population fragmentation and ecosystem decay . Habitat fragmentation can be caused by geological processes that slowly alter the layout of the physical environment ( suspected of being one of the major causes of speciation ) , or by human activity such as land conversion , which can alter the environment much faster and causes extinctions of many species .
