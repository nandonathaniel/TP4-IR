The tournament winner was decided by a final round - robin group contested by four teams ( Uruguay , Brazil , Sweden , and Spain ) . Coincidentally , one of the last two matches of the tournament pitted the two top ranked teams against each other , with Uruguay 's 2 -- 1 victory over Brazil thus often being considered as the de facto final of the 1950 World Cup . Likewise , the game between the lowest ranked teams , played at the same time as Uruguay vs Brazil , can be considered equal to a Third Place match , with Sweden 's 3 -- 1 victory over Spain ensuring that they finished third .
