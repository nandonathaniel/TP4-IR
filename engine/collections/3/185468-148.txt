In South Korea , the film was released during the 2015 MERS outbreak , which resulted in a fall in film attendance from late May of 2015 ; local film distributors changed or postponed local films ' release dates . Because U.S. film studios are debarred from altering their scheduled dates , the film had to be released on its scheduled date .
