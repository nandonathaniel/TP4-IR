A 1981 production of The Merchant of Venice was a hit with Chinese audiences as the play was seen promoting the theme of justice and fairness in life , with the character of Portia being especially popular as she seen as standing for as one critic wrote for `` the humanist spirit of the Renaissance '' with its striving for `` individuality , human rights and freedom '' . The theme of a religious conflict between a Jewish merchant vs. a Christian merchant in The Merchant of Venice is generally ignored in Chinese productions of The Merchant of Venice as most Chinese find do not find the theme of Jewish - Christian conflict relevant. , Unlike in Western productions , the character of Shylock is very much an unnuanced villain in Chinese productions of The Merchant of Venice , being presented as a man capable only of envy , spite , greed and cruelty , a man whose actions are only motivated by his spiritual impoverishment . By contrast , in the West , Shylock is usually presented as a nuanced villain , of a man who has never held power over a Christian before , and lets that power go to his head . Another popular play , especially with dissidents under the Communist government , is Hamlet . Hamlet , with its theme of a man trapped under a tyrannical regime is very popular with Chinese dissidents with one dissident Wu Ningkun writing about his time in internal exile between 1958 - 61 at a collective farm in a remote part of northern Manchuria that he understood all too well the line from the play `` Denmark is a prison !
