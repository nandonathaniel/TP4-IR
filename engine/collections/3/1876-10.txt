A transfer RNA ( abbreviated tRNA and formerly referred to as sRNA , for soluble RNA ) is an adaptor molecule composed of RNA , typically 76 to 90 nucleotides in length , that serves as the physical link between the mRNA and the amino acid sequence of proteins . tRNA does this by carrying an amino acid to the protein synthetic machinery of a cell ( ribosome ) as directed by a three - nucleotide sequence ( codon ) in a messenger RNA ( mRNA ) . As such , tRNAs are a necessary component of translation , the biological synthesis of new proteins in accordance with the genetic code .
