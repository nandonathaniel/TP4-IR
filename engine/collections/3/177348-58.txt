In general the ' Spanish conquest of Mexico ' denotes the conquest of the central region of Mesoamerica where the Aztec Empire was based . The fall of the Aztec capital of Tenochtitlan in 1521 was a decisive event , but Spaniards conquered other regions of Mexico , such as Yucatán , extended long after Spaniards consolidated control of central Mexico . The Spanish conquest of Yucatán is the much longer campaign , from 1551 to 1697 , against the Maya peoples of the Maya civilization in the Yucatán Peninsula of present - day Mexico and northern Central America .
