Coinciding with the 34 - volume kanzenban re-release of the manga , and the release of the entire series on DVD for the first time in Japan , four new guidebooks were released in 2003 and 2004 . Dragon Ball Landmark and Dragon Ball Forever cover the manga , using volume numbers for story points that reference the kanzenban release , while Dragon Ball : Tenkaichi Densetsu ( ドラゴンボール 天下 一 伝説 ) and Dragon Ball Z : Son Goku Densetsu ( ドラゴンボール Z 孫悟空 伝説 ) cover the Dragon Ball and Dragon Ball Z anime , respectively . Much of the material in these books is reused from the earlier Daizenshuu volumes , but they include new textual material including substantial interviews with the creator , cast and production staff of the series . Son Goku Densetsu in particular showcases previously - unpublished design sketches of Goku 's father Bardock , drawn by character designer Katsuyoshi Nakatsuru prior to creator Akira Toriyama 's revisions that resulted in the final version .
