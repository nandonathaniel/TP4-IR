`` There is no alternative to this administrative system ... The Union will go , you will not have a united India if you do not have good All - India Service which has the independence to speak out its mind , which has sense of security that you will standby your work ... If you do not adopt this course , then do not follow the present Constitution . Substitute something else ... these people are the instrument . Remove them and I see nothing , but a picture of chaos all round the country . '' -- Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel in Constituent Assembly discussing the role of All India Services .
