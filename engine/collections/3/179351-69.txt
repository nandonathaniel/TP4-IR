Cations which are left after carefully separating previous groups are considered to be in the sixth analytical group . The most important ones are Mg , Li , Na and K. All the ions are distinguished by flame color : lithium gives a red flame , sodium gives bright yellow ( even in trace amounts ) , potassium gives violet , and magnesium , colorless ( although magnesium metal burns with a bright white flame ) .
