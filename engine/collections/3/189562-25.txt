Tom then flies by his house spying on Jerry , who thinks that he saw something . Jerry then opens the front door and gets knocked down by Tom , who then gets off the broom and points to Jerry . The broom hits Jerry and sweeps him into a dustpan . Tom leaves and returns to the witch 's house where the witch is waiting for him . She is very angry about Tom `` stealing a ride '' and casts a spell on the broom , saying that she 'll give Tom a `` real '' ride . The broom takes Tom on a painful ride , dragging his head through the ceiling , causing him to bounce down the stairs , and crashing into a table . The broom then acts like a pogo stick with Tom holding on to it .
