`` Be Our Guest '' was used as the commercial for the 1994 Tony Awards . Michael Goldstein of New York correctly predicted that Mann would earn a Tony Award nomination for his performance . Despite having been nominated for a total of nine individual awards , Beauty and the Beast was ultimately shunned at the ceremony , winning only one award -- Best Costume Design -- for Hould - Ward . Nominated for the Tony Award for Best Musical , the production famously lost to Stephen Sondheim 's Passion , which is considered to be his own version of the `` Beauty and the Beast '' fairy tale . In 1995 , some of Hould - Ward 's costumes , namely Lumiere , were put on display in Nordstrom stores . Meanwhile , Belle and the Beast 's ballroom costumes were exhibited at Westside Pavilion , and Mrs. Potts and LeFou appeared at South Coast Plaza .
