Muslims comprise around 7 % ( 63,000 people ) of the total population of Fiji , a small tropical island - nation northeast of Australia . The Muslim community mostly consists of people of Indian origin , descendants of indentured labourers who were brought to the islands in the late 19th and early 20th centuries by the British colonists . Although no accurate statistical evidence exists , there are also thought to be a few hundred indigenous Fijian Muslims ( Melanesians ) in the island nation . The vast majority of Muslims in Fiji are of the Sunni branch of Islam who follow the Hanafi school of jurisprudence .
