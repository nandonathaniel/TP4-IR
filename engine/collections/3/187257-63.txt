In Arizona v. Rumsey , 467 U.S. 203 ( 1984 ) , a judge had held a separate hearing after the jury trial to decide if the sentence should be death or life imprisonment , in which he decided that the circumstances of the case did not permit death to be imposed . On appeal , the judge 's ruling was found to be erroneous . However , even though the decision to impose life instead of death was based on an erroneous interpretation of the law by the judge , the conclusion of life imprisonment in the original case constituted an acquittal of the death penalty and thus death could not be imposed upon a subsequent trial . Even though the acquittal of the death penalty was erroneous in that case , the acquittal must stand .
