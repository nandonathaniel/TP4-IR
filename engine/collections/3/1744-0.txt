Judicial review is a process under which executive and ( in some countries ) legislative actions are subject to review by the judiciary . A court with judicial review power may invalidate laws and decisions that are incompatible with a higher authority ; an executive decision may be invalidated for being unlawful or a statute may be invalidated for violating the terms of a written constitution . Judicial review is one of the checks and balances in the separation of powers : the power of the judiciary to supervise the legislative and executive branches when the latter exceed their authority . The doctrine varies between jurisdictions , so the procedure and scope of judicial review may differ between and within countries .
