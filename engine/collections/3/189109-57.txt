After buying the rights from Castle Rock , Miramax gave the green light to put the film into production . Several well - known filmmakers were originally considered to direct , including Mel Gibson , Michael Mann , and Steven Soderbergh . Originally , Affleck asked Kevin Smith if he was interested in directing . He declined , saying they needed a `` good director '' and that he only directs things he writes and is not much of a visual director , but still served as one of the film 's executive producers . Damon and Affleck later chose Gus Van Sant for the job , whose work on previous films like Drugstore Cowboy ( 1989 ) had left a favorable impression on the fledgling screenwriters . Miramax was persuaded and hired Van Sant to direct the film .
