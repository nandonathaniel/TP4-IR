In a study on Holstein -- Friesian heifers learning to press a panel to open a gate for access to a food reward , the researchers also recorded the heart rate and behavior of the heifers when moving along the race towards the food . When the heifers made clear improvements in learning , they had higher heart rates and tended to move more vigorously along the race . The researchers concluded this was an indication that cattle may react emotionally to their own learning improvement .
