It is sometimes convenient to scale the numbers on the number line with a logarithmic scale , using scientific notation . For example , the number one inch to the right of 0 might be 1 , then the number one inch farther to the right would be 10 ( = 10 ) , then one inch to the right of that would be 10 ( = 100 ) , then 1000 , then 10,000 , etc . This approach is useful , for example , in illustrating a sequence of events in the history of the universe or of evolution , or in comparing distances to various stars .
