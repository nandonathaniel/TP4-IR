At 7 : 15 am EDT on October 25 , USS Essex and USS Gearing attempted to intercept Bucharest but failed to do so . Fairly certain that the tanker did not contain any military material , the US allowed it through the blockade . Later that day , at 5 : 43 pm , the commander of the blockade effort ordered the destroyer USS Joseph P. Kennedy Jr. to intercept and board the Lebanese freighter Marucla . That took place the next day , and Marucla was cleared through the blockade after its cargo was checked .
