In his essay Lost in Non-Translation , biochemist and author Isaac Asimov asserts ( despite portrayals of many good Samaritans in Luke 17 : 11 - 19 ; Acts 8 : 5 - 7 ; 15 : 3 , as well as John 4 : 4 - 42 , etc . ) that at the time when the parable was included in the gospel , there were no good Samaritans ; in his view , this was half the point of the parable . As Asimov put it , we need to think of the story occurring in Alabama in 1950 , with a mayor and a preacher ignoring a man who has been beaten and robbed , with the role of the Samaritan being played by a poor black sharecropper .
