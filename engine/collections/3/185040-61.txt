When the cafetaria gets closed due to a rat invading it , Zack brings a food truck to sell his `` Meal Shakes '' . It is a success until Justin from the Night Lizards comes to the school and brings his own food truck and sells sticked food called `` Stick It to Ya ! '' in revenge for School of Rock 's victory in Battle of the Bands . The food trucks compete as the Principal only allows one to operate , and Stick It to Ya ! quickly outshines Meal Shakes . Zack gets angry when the rest of his bandmates eat Stick It to Ya ! . They make it up by helping Zack improve his truck and promoting it better , which beats Stick It to Ya 's popularity and forces Justin to leave the school in disgrace . Mr. Finn is assigned to catch the rat , but is so frightened . He overcomes his fear when the rat is willing to go to the cage and in return he secretly keeps him in his teacher desk .
