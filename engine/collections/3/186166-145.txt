Sociologists report that Southern collective identity stems from political , demographic and cultural distinctiveness . Studies have shown that Southerners are more conservative than non-Southerners in several areas including religion , morality , international relations and race relations . In the 21st century , the South remains demographically distinct with higher percentages of blacks , lower percentages of high school graduates , lower housing values , lower household incomes and higher percentages of people in poverty . That , combined with the fact that Southerners continue to maintain strong loyalty to family ties , has led some sociologists to label white Southerners a `` quasi-ethnic regional group '' .
