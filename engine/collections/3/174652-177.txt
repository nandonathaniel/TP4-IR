In addition to content generating bots , users can purchase followers , favorites , retweets and comments on various websites that cater to expanding a user 's image through accumulation of followers . With more followers , users ' profiles gain more attention , thus increasing their popularity . Generating Web traffic is a valuable commodity for both individuals and businesses because it indicates notability . With Twitterbots , users are able to create the illusion of `` buzz '' on their site by obtaining followers from services such as Swenzy and underground suppliers who operate bot farms or click farms . The companies that facilitate this service create fake Twitter accounts that follow a number of people , some of these Twitter accounts may even post fake tweets to make it seem like they are real . This practice of obtaining mass amounts of twitterbots as followers is not permitted on Twitter . The emphasis on followers and likes as a measure of social capital has urged people to extend their circle to weak and latent ties to promote the idea of popularity for celebrities , politicians , musicians , public figures , and companies alike . According to The New York Times , bots amass significant influence and have been noted to sway elections , influence the stock market , public appeal , and attack governments .
