Heavy or light traffic within the ride system can cause speed variations as the vehicles try not to enter the specified safety distance between one another . On busy days , each vehicle may slow to a crawl at intervals within the ride path in order to allow the vehicle ahead to gain distance , then suddenly jerk back into higher speed . Because of these unexpected variations in speed , the soundtrack to the ride is not of a specific length , in fact , each scene of the attraction has a pre-selected score to play which is already of a certain length . If the vehicle finds itself remaining in one scene for an extended period of time , the score will play in full or until the vehicle leaves the scene . If the vehicle remains in a scene longer than the length of the score , then an exaggerated soundtrack of the vehicle 's engine will fade - in and play to keep riders from experiencing awkward silence . Due to safety reasons , vehicles on the ride path can not reverse . Contrary to the finale scene when the vehicle reverses away from the boulder , the vehicle is actually stationary while the motion base tilts backwards and the cave walls accelerate past the riders to give the illusion of reversing .
