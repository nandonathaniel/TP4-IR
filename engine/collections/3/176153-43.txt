How courteous is the Japanese ; He always says , `` Excuse it , please . '' He climbs into his neighbor 's garden , And smiles , and says , `` I beg your pardon '' ; He bows and grins a friendly grin , And calls his hungry family in ; He grins , and bows a friendly bow ; `` So sorry , this my garden now . ''
