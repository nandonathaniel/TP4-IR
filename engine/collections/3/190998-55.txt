Doug Jones as Saru : A Science Officer serving as a Lieutenant Commander aboard the Discovery , and the first Kelpien to enter Starfleet . Kelpiens , a new species created for Discovery , were hunted as prey on their home planet and thus evolved the ability to sense the coming of death . They have a reputation for cowardice in the Federation . Jones was excited to , `` from the ground up , develop and find this character and his species '' and not have to honor a previous fan - favorite representation . He based Saru 's walk on that of a supermodel , out of necessity thanks to the boots he had to wear to portray the character 's hooved feet forcing Jones to walk on the balls of his feet . The producers compared Saru to the characters Spock and Data from previous series .
