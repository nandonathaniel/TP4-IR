In 1989 , Manchester - based Nigel Martin - Smith sought to create a British male vocal singing group modelled on New Kids on the Block . Martin - Smith 's vision , however , was a teen - orientated group that would appeal to more than one demographic segment of the music industry . Martin - Smith was introduced to young singer - songwriter Gary Barlow , who had been performing in clubs since the age of 15 . Impressed with Barlow 's catalogue of self - written material , Martin - Smith decided to build his new - look boy band around Barlow 's musical abilities . A campaign to audition young men with abilities in dancing and singing followed and took place in Manchester and other surrounding cities in 1990 . At 22 , Howard Donald was one of the oldest to audition , but he was chosen after he got time off work as a vehicle painter to continue the process . Prior to auditioning , Jason Orange had appeared as a breakdancer on the popular television programme The Hit Man and Her . Martin - Smith also selected 18 - year - old bank employee Mark Owen and finally 16 - year - old Robbie Williams to round out the group , which initially went by the name Kick It .
