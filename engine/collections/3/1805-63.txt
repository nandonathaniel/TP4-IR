A straight bill of lading is used when payment has been made in advance of shipment and requires a carrier to deliver the merchandise to the appropriate party . An order bill of lading is used when shipping merchandise prior to payment , requiring a carrier to deliver the merchandise to the importer , and at the endorsement of the exporter the carrier may transfer title to the importer . Endorsed order bills of lading can be traded as a security or serve as collateral against debt obligations .
