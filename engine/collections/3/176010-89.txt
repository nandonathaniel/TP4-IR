The social interaction that occurs as a result of birth order however is the most notable . Older siblings often become role models of behaviour , and younger siblings become learners and supervisees . Older siblings are at a developmental advantage both cognitively and socially . The role of birth order also depends greatly and varies greatly on family context . Family size , sibling identification , age gaping , modeling , parenting techniques , gender , class , race , and temperament are all confounding variables that can influence behaviour and therefore perceived behaviour of specific birth categories . The research on birth order does have stronger correlations , however , in areas such as intelligence and physical features , but are likely caused by other factors other than the actual position of birth . Some research has found that firstborn children have slightly higher IQs on average than later born children . However , other research finds no such effect . It has been found that first - borns score three points higher compared to second borns and that children born earlier in a family are on average , taller and weigh more than those born later . However , it is impossible to generalize birth order characteristics and apply them universally to all individuals in that subgroup .
