The Senate , as required by the Treaty Clause of the Constitution , must consent to the ratification of treaties negotiated by the executive branch with foreign governments . In October 1999 , for example , the Committee on Foreign Relations and the Committee on Armed Services held hearings on the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty . Also that year the Committee on Foreign Relations held hearings on ratifying tax treaties with Estonia , Venezuela , Denmark , and other nations .
