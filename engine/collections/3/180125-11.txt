The mechanism of transmission of this disease starts with the injection of the parasite into the victim 's blood when malaria - infected female Anopheles mosquitoes bite into a human being . The parasite uses human liver cells as hosts for maturation where it will continue to replicate and grow , moving into other areas of the body via the bloodstream . The spread of this infection cycle then continues when other mosquitoes bite the same victim . The result will cause that mosquito to ingest the parasite and allow it to transmit the Malaria disease into another person through the same mode of bite injection .
