In 1853 , upon completion of the Grand Trunk Railway to Montreal , Portland became the primary ice - free winter seaport for Canadian exports . The Portland Company manufactured more than 600 19th - century steam locomotives . Portland became a 20th - century rail hub as five additional rail lines merged into Portland Terminal Company in 1911 . Following nationalization of the Grand Trunk system in 1923 , Canadian export traffic was diverted from Portland to Halifax , Nova Scotia , resulting in marked local economic decline . In the 20th century , icebreakers later enabled ships to reach Montreal in winter , drastically reducing Portland 's role as a winter port for Canada .
