In Greece and Rome , wall painting was not considered as high art . The most prestigious form of art besides sculpture was panel painting , i.e. tempera or encaustic painting on wooden panels . Unfortunately , since wood is a perishable material , only a very few examples of such paintings have survived , namely the Severan Tondo from c. 200 AD , a very routine official portrait from some provincial government office , and the well - known Fayum mummy portraits , all from Roman Egypt , and almost certainly not of the highest contemporary quality . The portraits were attached to burial mummies at the face , from which almost all have now been detached . They usually depict a single person , showing the head , or head and upper chest , viewed frontally . The background is always monochrome , sometimes with decorative elements . In terms of artistic tradition , the images clearly derive more from Greco - Roman traditions than Egyptian ones . They are remarkably realistic , though variable in artistic quality , and may indicate that similar art which was widespread elsewhere but did not survive . A few portraits painted on glass and medals from the later empire have survived , as have coin portraits , some of which are considered very realistic as well .
