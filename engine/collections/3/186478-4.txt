The question of whether there exist infinitely many twin primes has been one of the great open questions in number theory for many years . This is the content of the twin prime conjecture , which states that there are infinitely many primes p such that p + 2 is also prime . In 1849 , de Polignac made the more general conjecture that for every natural number k , there are infinitely many primes p such that p + 2k is also prime . The case k = 1 of de Polignac 's conjecture is the twin prime conjecture .
