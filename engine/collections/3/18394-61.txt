The decision known as In re Amway Corp. , and popularly called Amway ' 79 , made the FTC a captive regulator of the nascent Multi-Level Marketing industry . The situation came to a head in December 2012 when hedge fund Pershing Square Capital Management announced an $1 billion short position against the company , and evidently expected the FTC to act , which to date it did not . From a forensic accounting standpoint , there is no difference between a Ponzi - scheme like the Madoff scandal , and a pyramid scheme , except that in the latter the money is laundered through product sales , not investment . The press has widely reported on why the FTC wo n't act , e.g. Forbes though legal opinion has been very supportive in some quarters , such as Prof. William K. Black , who was instrumental in bringing thousands of criminal prosecutions in the S&L scandal , which was also rife with problems of regulatory capture .
