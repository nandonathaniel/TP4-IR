Alternative lines of research have stressed the role of climate in inducing erosion that induces an isostatic compensation ; fluvial and glacial erosion and incision during the Quaternary is thought to have contributed to the uplift of the mountain by forcing an isostatic response . The total amount of uplift produced by this mechanism could be as much as 500 m . Others geoscientists have implied diapirism in the asthenosphere as being the cause of uplift . One hypothesis claim that the early uplift of the Scandinavian Mountains could be indebted to changes in the density of the lithosphere and asthenosphere caused by the Iceland plume when Greenland and Scandinavia rifted apart about 53 million years ago .
