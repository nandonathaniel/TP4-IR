From 1953 onward , Cage was busy composing music for modern dance , particularly Cunningham 's dances ( Cage 's partner adopted chance too , out of fascination for the movement of the human body ) , as well as developing new methods of using chance , in a series of works he referred to as The Ten Thousand Things . In the summer of 1954 he moved out of New York and settled in a cooperative community in Stony Point , New York , where his neighbors included David Tudor , M.C. Richards , Karen Karnes , Stan VanDerBeek , and Sari Dienes . The composer 's financial situation gradually improved : in late 1954 he and Tudor were able to embark on a European tour . From 1956 to 1961 Cage taught classes in experimental composition at The New School , and from 1956 to 1958 he also worked as an art director and designer of typography . Among his works completed during the last years of the decade were Concert for Piano and Orchestra ( 1957 -- 58 ) , a seminal work in the history of graphic notation , and Variations I ( 1958 ) .
