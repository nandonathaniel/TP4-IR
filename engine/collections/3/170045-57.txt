A paint application such as GIMP or Adobe Photoshop must communicate with the scanner . There are many different scanners , and many of those scanners use different protocols . In order to simplify applications programming , some Applications programming interfaces ( `` API '' ) were developed . The API presents a uniform interface to the scanner . This means that the application does not need to know the specific details of the scanner in order to access it directly . For example , Adobe Photoshop supports the TWAIN standard ; therefore in theory Photoshop can acquire an image from any scanner that has a TWAIN driver .
