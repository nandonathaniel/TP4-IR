The German engineer Carl Humann came to Pergamon for the first time in 1864 / 65 . He was charged with geographic investigations and repeatedly visited the city in the following years . He urged the preservation of the antiquities on the acropolis and attempted to find partners to assist in an excavation ; as a private person he was not equal to such a major task , lacking the financial and logistic resources . It was important to begin excavation work as soon as possible because the local inhabitants of Bergama ( the modern name of the ancient city of Pergamon ) were using the altar and other above - ground ruins as a quarry , were looting the remnants of antique constructions in order to erect new buildings , and were burning some of the marble for lime . In 1871 the Berlin classicist Ernst Curtius and several other German scholars came to Pergamon at Humann 's invitation . He arranged to ship some of the finds to Berlin , including two fragments of the altar frieze . He described the reliefs as ( translated ) `` a battle with men , horses and wild animals '' . These pieces were put on display but were at first largely ignored .
