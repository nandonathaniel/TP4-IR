Companies like Dell improved the AT bus 's performance but in 1987 , IBM replaced the AT bus with its proprietary Micro Channel Architecture ( MCA ) . MCA overcame many of the limitations then apparent in ISA but was also an effort by IBM to regain control of the PC architecture and the PC market . MCA was far more advanced than ISA and had many features that would later appear in PCI . However , MCA was also a closed standard whereas IBM had released full specifications and circuit schematics for ISA . Computer manufacturers responded to MCA by developing the Extended Industry Standard Architecture ( EISA ) and the later VESA Local Bus ( VLB ) . VLB used some electronic parts originally intended for MCA because component manufacturers already were equipped to manufacture them . Both EISA and VLB were backwards - compatible expansions of the AT ( ISA ) bus .
