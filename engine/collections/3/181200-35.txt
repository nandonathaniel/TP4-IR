The exact organisation of the INA and its precise troop strength is not known , since its records were destroyed by the withdrawing Azad Hind Government before Rangoon was recaptured by Commonwealth forces in 1945 . The order of battle described by Fay ( constructed from discussions with INA - veterans ) , nonetheless , is similar to that described of the first INA by Toye in The Springing Tiger . The 1st Division , under M.Z. Kiani , drew a large number of ex-Indian army prisoners of war who had joined Mohan Singh 's first INA . It also drew prisoners of war who had not joined in 1942 . It consisted of the 2nd Guerrilla Regiment ( the Gandhi Brigade ) consisting of two battalions under Col. Inayat Kiani ; the 3rd Guerrilla Regiment ( the Azad Brigade ) with three battalions under Col. Gulzara Singh ; and the 4th Guerrilla Regiment ( or Nehru Brigade ) commanded by the end of the war by Lt. Col Gurubaksh Singh Dhillon . The 1st Guerrilla Regiment -- the Subhas Brigade -- under Col. Shah Nawaz Khan was an independent unit , consisting of three infantry battalions . A special operations group was also to be set up called the Bahadur group ( Valiant ) , to operate behind enemy lines .
