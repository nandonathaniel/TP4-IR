In 2013 , the IAEA report that there are 437 operational nuclear power reactors , in 31 countries , although not every reactor is producing electricity . In addition , there are approximately 140 naval vessels using nuclear propulsion in operation , powered by some 180 reactors . As of 2013 , attaining a net energy gain from sustained nuclear fusion reactions , excluding natural fusion power sources such as the Sun , remains an ongoing area of international physics and engineering research . More than 60 years after the first attempts , commercial fusion power production remains unlikely before 2050 .
