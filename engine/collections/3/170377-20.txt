Huntley counters the findings of Franks et al. ( Huntley 2007 ) with a study by Wu , et al. ( Wu L 1975 ) which provided evidence that not only different species but also different populations of the same species exhibited markedly different potentials for the selection of heavy metal tolerant genotypes . This lead Bradshaw and McNeilly to conclude that different populations of the same species can adapt their phenology to survive in the short term and at local sites , but genetic variation across an entire species in response to rapid climate change is not possible ( Bradshaw 1991 ) .
