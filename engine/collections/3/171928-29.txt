If informed consent is used as the lawful basis for processing , consent must have been explicit for data collected and each purpose data is used for ( Article 7 ; defined in Article 4 ) . Consent must be a specific , freely - given , plainly - worded , and unambiguous affirmation given by the data subject ; an online form which has consent options selected by default is a violation of GDPR , as the consent is not unambiguously affirmed by the user on an `` opt - in '' basis . In addition , multiple types of processing may not be `` bundled '' together into a single affirmation prompt , as this is not specific to each use of data . ( Recital 32 ) .
