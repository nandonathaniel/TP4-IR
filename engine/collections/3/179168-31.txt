To counter these tactics , the British under Kitchener interned Boer civilians into concentration camps and built hundreds of blockhouses all over the Transvaal and Orange Free State . Kitchener also enacted a scorched earth policy , destroying Boer homes and farms . Eventually , the Boer guerrillas surrendered in 1902 , but the British granted them generous terms in order to bring the war to an end . This showed how effective guerrilla tactics could be in extracting concessions from a militarily more powerful enemy .
