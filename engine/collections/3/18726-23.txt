In the meantime , the news media is all abuzz with tales of a fearsome terror known only as the `` Kala Bandar '' ( The Black Monkey ) . This miscreant ( never shown clearly in the film ) attacks people , steals and has caused the death of a few innocent people . ( These deaths are mostly accidental , as in the example of a pregnant housewife who was supposedly startled by a silhouette and fell down a flight of stairs or the unfortunate man who was briefly zapped by a live electric wire . ) Nonetheless , the local news picks up on every move by the kala bandar and loudly blares about all his exploits . Jaigopal , the self - proclaimed electronics genius , theorises that the kala bandar likely has an electrical circuit ( to zap his victims ) and may be electrocuted by water ; this rumour is quickly propagated .
