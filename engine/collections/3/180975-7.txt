The original telegraph used two wires between two stations to form a complete electrical circuit or `` loop . '' In 1837 , however , Carl August von Steinheil of Munich , Germany , found that by connecting one leg of the apparatus at each station to metal plates buried in the ground , he could eliminate one wire and use a single wire for telegraphic communication . This led to speculation that it might be possible to eliminate both wires and therefore transmit telegraph signals through the ground without any wires connecting the stations . Other attempts were made to send the electric current through bodies of water , in order to span rivers , for example . Prominent experimenters along these lines included Samuel F.B. Morse in the United States and James Bowman Lindsay in Great Britain , who in August 1854 , was able to demonstrate transmission across a mill dam at a distance of 500 yards ( 457 metres ) .
