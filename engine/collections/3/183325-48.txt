A Microsoft account is required to use Office 2010 functionality related to OneDrive . In the Excel Web App , the OneNote Web App , and OneNote , edits to a shared document in a co-authoring session occur on a sequential basis , and appear in near real - time as a shared document automatically saves itself each time a co-author edits it . In PowerPoint and Word , users must upload changes to the server by manually saving the shared document .
