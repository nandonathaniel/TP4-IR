At the beginning of the 20th century , the Ottoman Empire continued to control or have a suzerainty over most of the peninsula . Subject to this suzerainty , Arabia was ruled by a patchwork of tribal rulers , with the Sharif of Mecca having pre-eminence and ruling the Hejaz . In 1902 , Abdul Rahman 's son , Abdul Aziz -- later to be known as Ibn Saud -- recaptured control of Riyadh bringing the Al Saud back to Nejd . Ibn Saud gained the support of the Ikhwan , a tribal army inspired by Wahhabism and led by Faisal Al - Dawish , and which had grown quickly after its foundation in 1912 . With the aid of the Ikhwan , Ibn Saud captured Al - Ahsa from the Ottomans in 1913 .
