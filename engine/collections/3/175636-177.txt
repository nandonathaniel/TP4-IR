In the Tibetan Jonang school , only the Buddha and the Buddha Nature are viewed as not intrinsically empty , but as truly real , unconditioned , and replete with eternal , changeless virtues . The Buddha Nature ( tathagatagarbha ) is only empty of what is impermanent and conditioned , not of its own self . The Buddha Nature is truly real , and primordially present in all beings .
