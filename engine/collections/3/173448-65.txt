On 20 November 1971 , the Indian Army moved the 14 Punjab Battalion 45 Cavalry into Garibpur , a strategically important town near India 's border with East Pakistan , and successfully captured it . The following day , more clashes took place between Indian and Pakistani forces . Wary of India 's growing involvement in the Bengali rebellion , the Pakistan Air Force ( PAF ) launched a preemptive strike on 10 Indian air bases at : Srinagar , Jammu , Pathankot , Amritsar , Agra , Adampur , Jodhpur , Jaisalmer , Uttarlai and Sirsa at 17 : 45 hours on 3 December . However , this aerial offensive failed to accomplish its stated objectives , and gave India an excuse to declare a full - scale war against Pakistan the same day . By midnight , the Indian Army , accompanied by the Indian Air Force , launched a major three - pronged assault into East Pakistan . The Indian Army won several battles on the eastern front including the decisive battle of Hilli , which was the only front where the Pakistani Army was able to build up considerable resistance . The operation also included a battalion - level airborne operation on Tangail , which resulted in the capitulation of all resistance within five days . India 's massive early gains were attributed largely to the speed and flexibility with which Indian armoured divisions moved across East Pakistan .
