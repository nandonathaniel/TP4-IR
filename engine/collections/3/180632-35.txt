The second bourrée , though in C minor , has a two - flat ( or G minor ) key signature . This notation , common in pre-Classical music , is sometimes known as a partial key signature . The first and second bourrée of the third suite are sometimes used as solo material for other bass instruments such as the tuba , euphonium , trombone and bassoon .
