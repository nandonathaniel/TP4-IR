Plant hormones are not nutrients , but chemicals that in small amounts promote and influence the growth , development , and differentiation of cells and tissues . The biosynthesis of plant hormones within plant tissues is often diffuse and not always localized . Plants lack glands to produce and store hormones , because , unlike animals -- which have two circulatory systems ( lymphatic and cardiovascular ) powered by a heart that moves fluids around the body -- plants use more passive means to move chemicals around their bodies . Plants utilize simple chemicals as hormones , which move more easily through their tissues . They are often produced and used on a local basis within the plant body . Plant cells produce hormones that affect even different regions of the cell producing the hormone .
