Ban Chiang , however , is the most thoroughly documented site while having the clearest evidence of metallurgy when it comes to Southeast Asia . With a rough date range of late 3rd millennium BC to the first millennium AD , this site alone has various artifacts such as burial pottery ( dating from 2100 -- 1700 BC ) , fragments of Bronze , copper - base bangles , and much more . What 's interesting about this site , however , is n't just the old age of the artifacts but the fact that this technology suggested on - site casting from the very beginning . The on - site casting supports the theory that Bronze was first introduced in Southeast Asia as fully developed which therefore shows that Bronze was actually innovated from a different country . Some scholars believe that the copper - based metallurgy was disseminated from northwest and central China via south and southwest areas such as Guangdong province and Yunnan province and finally into southeast Asia around 1000 BC .
