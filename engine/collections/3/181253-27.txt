On August 22 , 2006 , the band played a special one - off show at the 1800 - capacity London Hammersmith Palais . The show sold out in 15 minutes , prompting tickets to be re-sold on eBay well over the tickets ' face value . The name of the album was announced and 20 people dressed in black capes with their faces obscured paraded around the Hammersmith , followed by a large group of fans and street team members with signs saying `` The Black Parade '' . Later during the show , the album title and the UK release date were confirmed . Before the band took the stage , it was announced that My Chemical Romance was unable to play , but they would be replaced by The Black Parade . After initial crowd hostility , it became clear the band was simply performing under a pseudonym in keeping with the theme of the album . Since then , the band would often perform under the alias `` The Black Parade '' , wearing the costumes seen in the album 's music videos . Gerard Way would adopt the persona of the leader of the marching band , The Black Parade , and vary his behavior and performance accordingly .
