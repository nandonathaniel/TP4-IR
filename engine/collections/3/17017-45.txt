The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter - day Saints ( LDS Church ) accepts the legal authority of clergy to perform marriages but does not recognize any other sacraments performed by ministers not ordained to the Latter - day Saint priesthood . Although the Latter - day Saints do claim a doctrine of a certain spiritual `` apostolic succession , '' it is significantly different from that claimed by Catholics and Protestants since there is no succession or continuity between the first century and the lifetime of Joseph Smith , the founder of the LDS church . Mormons teach that the priesthood was lost in ancient times not to be restored by Christ until the nineteenth century when it was given to Joseph Smith directly .
