According to the official figures , as compiled by the 1979 Kemeny Commission from Metropolitan Edison and NRC data , a maximum of 480 PBq ( 13 MCi ) of radioactive noble gases ( primarily xenon ) were released by the event . However , these noble gases were considered relatively harmless , and only 481 -- 629 GBq ( 13.0 -- 17.0 Ci ) of thyroid cancer - causing iodine - 131 were released . Total releases according to these figures were a relatively small proportion of the estimated 370 EBq ( 10 GCi ) in the reactor . It was later found that about half the core had melted , and the cladding around 90 % of the fuel rods had failed , with 5 ft ( 1.5 m ) of the core gone , and around 20 short tons ( 18 t ) of uranium flowing to the bottom head of the pressure vessel , forming a mass of corium . The reactor vessel -- the second level of containment after the cladding -- maintained integrity and contained the damaged fuel with nearly all of the radioactive isotopes in the core .
