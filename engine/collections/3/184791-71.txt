The architect Raymond Erith carried out the design for this painstaking work and the contractor that undertook it was John Mowlem & Co . The Times reported initially that the cost for the project would be £ 400,000 . After more careful studies were completed , it was concluded that the `` total cost was likely to be £ 1,250,000 '' and would take two years to complete . In the end , the cost was close to £ 3,000,000 and took almost three years due in large part to 14 labour strikes . There were also delays when archaeological excavations uncovered important artefacts dating from Roman , Saxon and medieval times . Macmillan lived in Admiralty House during the reconstruction .
