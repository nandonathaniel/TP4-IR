Choosing not to recast the Kate Bradley role , or to sign Rosemary DeCamp on full - time ( she was also playing the mother of Marlo Thomas on That Girl ) , the producers introduced the new character of Dr. Janet Craig , played by June Lockhart . Dr. Craig takes up a medical practice at the hotel and also serves as a counsel of sorts for the girls . The cast was described as `` most welcoming '' to Lockhart as the newcomer during a difficult time . Quickly , Lockhart graduated from featured billing at the end of each episode to co-star billing in the opening credits . The show 's theme song lyrics were slightly altered to accommodate the change in cast .
