The area where the Garden of Marvels and Shockwave roller coaster were located was cleared as part of Great Adventure 's `` War on Lines '' in the 1999 season . It became home to the still running Dare Devil Dive and Houdini 's Great Escape . The ride was opened slightly after the start of the 1999 season as a very successful ride . The ride was closed after the 2007 season , not be opened again until Fright Fest 2009 . The Houdini 's Great Escape entrance sign was removed , but the indoor and outdoor parts of the ride remained . No information was given about the fate of the ride until it was re-opened for Fright Fest at the end of the 2009 season . Excited park guests were disappointed to find out that the ride was planned to be closed the entire 2010 summer season until Fright Fest . A Facebook group was made to support the reopening of the ride for the whole season . Six Flags management said during a `` Super Fan Call '' that Houdini 's Great Escape was slated to be open Memorial Day through Labor Day during the 2010 season . The ride opened early on May 22 , 2010 and although the ride was planned to be closed on Labor Day , the park decided to keep the ride open past the planned closure date .
