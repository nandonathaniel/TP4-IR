Both hydrothermal and flux - growth synthetics have been produced , and a method has been developed for producing an emerald overgrowth on colorless beryl . The first commercially successful emerald synthesis process was that of Carroll Chatham , likely involving a lithium vanadate flux process , as Chatham 's emeralds do not have any water and contain traces of vanadate , molybdenum and vanadium . The other large producer of flux emeralds was Pierre Gilson Sr. , whose products have been on the market since 1964 . Gilson 's emeralds are usually grown on natural colorless beryl seeds , which are coated on both sides . Growth occurs at the rate of 1 mm per month , a typical seven - month growth run produces emerald crystals 7 mm thick .
