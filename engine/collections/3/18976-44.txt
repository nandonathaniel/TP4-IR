Ron Harper and James Naughton played Alan Virdon and Peter Burke , two 20th - century American astronauts who pass through a time warp to a future where apes subjugate humans ( unlike the original film , the humans can speak ) . Roddy McDowall returned to the franchise as Galen , a chimpanzee who joins the astronauts . Booth Coleman played orangutan Councillor Zaius and Mark Lenard played gorilla General Urko . The episodes portray Virdon , Burke , and Galen as they search for a way home , aid downtrodden humans and apes , and avoid the authorities . The show premiered on September 13 , 1974 , filling CBS 's 8 -- 9 p.m. time slot on Fridays . It earned low ratings during its run , a fact the production team attributed to repetitive storytelling and too little screen time for the apes who made the franchise famous . Given the considerable production costs , CBS cancelled the show after 14 episodes , the last airing on December 20 , 1974 .
