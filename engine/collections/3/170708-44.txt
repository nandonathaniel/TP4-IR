Connecticut started off with the raw materials of abundant running water and navigable waterways , and using the Yankee work ethic quickly became an industrial leader . Between the birth of the U.S. patent system in 1790 and 1930 , Connecticut had more patents issued per capita than any other state ; in the 1800s , when the U.S. as a whole was issued one patent per three thousand population , Connecticut inventors were issued one patent for every 700 -- 1000 residents . Connecticut 's first recorded invention was a lapidary machine , by Abel Buell of Killingworth , in 1765 .
