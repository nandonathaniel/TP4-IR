As the SEALs were beginning to make headway in Ramadi , AQI was starting to infiltrate the area by targeting local Sheikhs and convincing them to allow jihadists to marry into local tribes , thus cementing their powerbase and Sheikhs that resisted these advances were met with typical AQI brutality . Al - Qaeda 's efforts to install a Sharia - style shadow government in Ramadi led to AQI 's downfall - when in the first half of 2006 , in the run - up to the Second Battle of Ramadi SEALs , increasingly partnered with conventional forces of the 1st Brigade Combat Team , 1st Armored Division which was planning the offensive . SEALs along with the Scouts and SMP , would conduct reconnaissance , surveillance and sniper overwatch tasks ; with their own targeting cell , they also began conducting raids on local insurgent leaders . The 1st BCT began the concerted offensive to clear Ramadi of AQI fighters ; on 29 September 2006 , whilst at a rooftop overwatch position , Petty Officer Michael A. Monsoor died after leaping upon an enemy grenade during a rooftop firefight , two SEALs on the roof were badly wounded from the grenade fragments and their local Iraqi Scouts ran back into the cover of the building , a fourth SEAL ( only lightly wounded ) , managed to radio his colleagues and get the Scouts to return fire . A SEAL element in a second overwatch position immediately ran through heavy fire to reach Monsoor ( whom later died from his wounds in the back of a Bradley IFV ) and the wounded SEALs , Monsoor was later awarded the Medal of Honor and the Silver Star . The advances by conventional forces and the SEALs in Ramadi , combined with the brutal tactics of AQI , helped to increase recruitment in a local police initiative - the programme was designed to bring the local Sheikhs ' militias into the Iraqi Security Forces . These volunteers would serve locally in their communities to defend them against al - Qaeda , a month after the kidnapping and murder of Sheikh Khalid by AQI ( which proved to be the tipping point ) , the Sheikhs signed a declaration agreeing to fight AQI and by the closing of 2006 , even former insurgents were joining the local police ( later known as the Anbar Awakening ) by the end of the battle , some 1,100 terrorists were killed .
