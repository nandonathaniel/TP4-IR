Brahman is discussed in Hindu texts with the concept of Atman ( Soul , Self ) , personal , impersonal or Para Brahman , or in various combinations of these qualities depending on the philosophical school . In dualistic schools of Hinduism such as the theistic Dvaita Vedanta , Brahman is different from Atman ( soul ) in each being , and therein it shares conceptual framework of God in major world religions . In non-dual schools such as the monist Advaita Vedanta , Brahman is identical to the Atman , is everywhere and inside each living being , and there is connected spiritual oneness in all existence .
