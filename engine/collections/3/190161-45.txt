Between 1742 and 1753 , roughly 1,000 Germans settled in Broad Bay , Massachusetts ( now Waldoboro , Maine ) . Many of the colonists fled to Boston , Maine , Nova Scotia , and North Carolina after their houses were burned and their neighbors killed or carried into captivity by Native Americans . The Germans who remained found it difficult to survive on farming , and eventually turned to the shipping and fishing industries .
