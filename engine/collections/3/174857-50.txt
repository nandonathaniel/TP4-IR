Several forms of laboratory testing for Lyme disease are available , some of which have not been adequately validated . The most widely used tests are serologies , which measure levels of specific antibodies in a patient 's blood . These tests may be negative in early infection as the body may not have produced a significant quantity of antibodies , but they are considered a reliable aid in the diagnosis of later stages of Lyme disease . Serologic tests for Lyme disease are of limited use in people lacking objective signs of Lyme disease because of false positive results and cost .
