Susan Oosthuizen has taken this further and establishes evidence that aspects of the `` collective organisation of arable cultivation appear to find an echo in fields of pre-historic and Roman Britain '' . In particular : the open field systems , shared between a number of cultivators , but cropped individually ; the link between arable holdings and rights to common pasture land ; in structures of governance and the duty to pay some of the surplus to the local overlord , whether in rent or duty . Together these reveal that kinship ties and social relations were continuous across the 5th and 6th centuries , with no evidence of the uniformity or destruction , imposed by lords , the savage action of invaders or system collapse . This has implications on how later developments are considered , such as the developments in the 7th and 8th centuries .
