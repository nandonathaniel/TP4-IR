The war furthered the decline of the Iranian economy that had begun with the revolution in 1978 -- 79 . Between 1979 and 1981 , foreign exchange reserves fell from $14.6 billion to $1 billion . As a result of the war , living standards dropped dramatically , and Iran was described by British journalists John Bulloch and Harvey Morris as `` a dour and joyless place '' ruled by a harsh regime that `` seemed to have nothing to offer but endless war . '' Though Iran was becoming bankrupt , Khomeini interpreted Islam 's prohibition of usury to mean they could not borrow against future oil revenues to meet war expenses . As a result , Iran funded the war by the income from oil exports after cash had run out . The revenue from oil dropped from $20 billion in 1982 to $5 billion in 1988. French historian Pierre Razoux argued that this sudden drop in economic industrial potential , in conjunction with the increasing aggression of Iraq , placed Iran in a challenging position that had little leeway other than accepting Iraq 's conditions of peace .
