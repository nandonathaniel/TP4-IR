The Dow 's bullish behavior began to stall during the 1960s as the U.S. became entangled with foreign political issues such as U.S. military excursions including the Bay of Pigs Invasion involving Cuba , the Vietnam War , the Portuguese Colonial War , the Colombian civil war which the U.S. assisted with short - lived counter-guerrilla campaigns , as well as domestic issues such as the Civil Rights Movement and several influential political assassinations . For the decade though , and despite a mild recession between 1960 and 1961 , the average still managed a respectable 30 % gain from the 616 level to 800 .
