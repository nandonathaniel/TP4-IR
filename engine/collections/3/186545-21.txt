Variety quickly gave way to a specialisation in film performances , with occasional performances by big bands . In June 1939 , the cinema was one of the three London sites chosen to present a live relay of The Epsom Derby from the pre-war BBC experimental transmissions , utilising Baird equipment to project onto a screen 15 feet by 12 ( 4.6 by 3.7 m ) in sepia . From September 1940 to May 1941 , the theatre was closed due to World War II , but no serious damage was sustained and it reopened quickly . Plans were made for demolition in the 1950s , but it was saved and presented a mixture of ballet , live shows and films . The last films were shown in November 1975 , a double bill of Peter Cushing in Legend of the Werewolf ( 1975 ) and Adrienne Corri in Vampire Circus ( 1972 ) , though the theatre remained open until 1976 , after which it closed for five years . Led Zeppelin rehearsed there , on May Day , 1980 . It reopened in 1981 as the Apollo Victoria Theatre with a Shirley Bassey concert .
