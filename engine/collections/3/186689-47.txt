Fund accounting distinguishes between two primary classes of fund . Those funds that have an unrestricted use , that can be spent for any purposes by the organization and those that have a restricted use . The reason for the restriction can be for a number of different reasons . Examples include legal requirements , where the moneys can only be lawfully used for a specific purpose , or a restriction imposed by the donor or provider . These donor / provider restrictions are usually communicated in writing and may be found in the terms of an agreement , government grant , will or gift .
