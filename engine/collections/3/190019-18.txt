Like cones , rod cells have a synaptic terminal , an inner segment , and an outer segment . The synaptic terminal forms a synapse with another neuron , usually a bipolar cell or a horizontal cell . The inner and outer segments are connected by a cilium , which lines the distal segment . The inner segment contains organelles and the cell 's nucleus , while the rod outer segment ( abbreviated to ROS ) , which is pointed toward the back of the eye , contains the light - absorbing materials .
