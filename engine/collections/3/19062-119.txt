In 2015 , a report written by the Journal 's John Carreyrou alleged that blood testing company Theranos ' technology was faulty and founder Elizabeth Holmes was misleading investors . According to Vanity Fair , `` a damning report published in The Wall Street Journal had alleged that the company was , in effect , a sham -- that its vaunted core technology was actually faulty and that Theranos administered almost all of its blood tests using competitors ' equipment . '' The Journal has subsequently published several more reports questioning Theranos ' and Holmes ' credibility .
