The gold specie standard ended in the United Kingdom and the rest of the British Empire at the outbreak of World War I , when Treasury notes replaced the circulation of gold sovereigns and gold half sovereigns . Legally , the gold specie standard was not repealed . The end of the gold standard was successfully effected by the Bank of England through appeals to patriotism urging citizens not to redeem paper money for gold specie . It was only in 1925 , when Britain returned to the gold standard in conjunction with Australia and South Africa that the gold specie standard was officially ended .
