Mays ' professional baseball career began in 1947 , while he was still in high school ; he played briefly with the Chattanooga Choo - Choos in Tennessee during the summer . A short time later , Mays left the Choo - Choos and returned to his home state to join the Birmingham Black Barons of the Negro American League . Mays helped them win the pennant and advance to the 1948 Negro League World Series , where they lost the series 4 - 1 to the Homestead Grays . Mays hit a respectable . 262 for the season , but it was also his excellent fielding and baserunning that made him a standout . By playing professionally with the Black Barons , Mays jeopardized his opportunities to play high school sports in Alabama . This created some problems for him with high school administrators at Fairfield , who wanted him to help the teams and ticket sales .
