Because of their codification in the Modern Greek state , surnames have Katharevousa forms even though Katharevousa is no longer the official standard . Thus , the Ancient Greek name Eleutherios forms the Modern Greek proper name Lefteris , and former vernacular practice ( prefixing the surname to the proper name ) was to call John Eleutherios Leftero - giannis .
