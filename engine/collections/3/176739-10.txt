While fast food restaurants usually have a seating area in which customers can eat the food on the premises , orders are designed to be taken away , and traditional table service is rare . Orders are generally taken and paid for at a wide counter , with the customer waiting by the counter for a tray or container for their food . A `` drive - through '' service can allow customers to order and pick up food from their cars .
