I had been told to go and see the Pont du Gard ; I did not fail to do so . It was the first work of the Romans that I had seen . I expected to see a monument worthy of the hands which had constructed it . This time the object surpassed my expectation , for the only time in my life . Only the Romans could have produced such an effect . The sight of this simple and noble work struck me all the more since it is in the middle of a wilderness where silence and solitude render the object more striking and the admiration more lively ; for this so - called bridge was only an aqueduct . One asks oneself what force has transported these enormous stones so far from any quarry , and what brought together the arms of so many thousands of men in a place where none of them live . I wandered about the three storeys of this superb edifice although my respect for it almost kept me from daring to trample it underfoot . The echo of my footsteps under these immense vaults made me imagine that I heard the strong voices of those who had built them . I felt myself lost like an insect in that immensity . While making myself small , I felt an indefinable something that raised up my soul , and I said to myself with a sigh , `` Why was I not born a Roman ! ''
