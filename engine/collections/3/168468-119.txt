'' James Berardinelli of ReelViews gave the film three out of four stars , saying `` Despicable Me 2 feels like an opportunity to get together with some old friends , hang out , and discover what they 've been up to . '' Tom Russo of The Boston Globe gave the film a positive review , saying `` The scope of the ' toon espionage - adventure goings - on is surprisingly limited . But the filmmakers so clearly love working on these characters , their creative joy is infectious .

'' Peter Debruge of Variety gave the film a positive review , saying `` While not quite as charming or unique as the original , Despicable Me 2 comes awfully close , extending co-directors Chris Renaud and Pierre Coffin 's delightfully silly sensibility to a bit larger universe . '' Peter Hartlaub of the San Francisco Chronicle gave the film three out of four stars , saying `` It 's a credit that the writing can be so funny in the moment , that it takes time to realize there 's no cohesive story , zero dramatic tension and nary a practical lesson for either the characters in the film or the people watching in the theater .
