Along with his brother , Shiloh Strong , he wrote and directed the short film , Irish Twins , which premiered at the 2008 Tribeca Film Festival . It went on to win both the Jury Award and Audience Award at the Woods Hole Film Festival , a Special Jury Prize in the Action / Cut Short Film Competition and Best First - Time Director at DC Shorts . Speaking to Pure Movies in 2010 he expressed that he wanted to expand his writing and directing career : ' Acting is always there and I enjoy it but it 's kind of got a little unfulfilling lately . You know , I 'm in the low budget horror world ... I have a whole lot of other stuff I want to do . '
