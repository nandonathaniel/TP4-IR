The international non-profit organization Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat ( CTBUH ) was formed in 1969 and announces the title of `` The World 's Tallest Building '' and sets the standards by which buildings are measured . It maintains a list of the 100 tallest completed buildings in the world . The organization currently ranks Burj Khalifa in Dubai as the tallest at 828 m ( 2,717 ft ) . The CTBUH only recognizes buildings that are complete , however , and some buildings listed within these list articles are not considered complete by the CTBUH .
