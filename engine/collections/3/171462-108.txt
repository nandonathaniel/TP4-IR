The convention in the English language is to call nearly all national heads of government `` prime minister '' ( sometimes modified to the equivalent term of `` premier '' ) , regardless of the correct title of the head of government as applied in his or her respective country . The few exceptions to the rule are Germany and Austria , whose heads of government titles are almost always translated as Chancellor ; Monaco , whose head of government is referred to as the Minister of State ; and Vatican City , for which the head of government is titled the Secretary of State . In the case of Ireland , the head of government is occasionally referred to as the Taoiseach by English speakers . A stand - out case is the President of Iran , who is not actually a head of state , but the head of the government of Iran . He is referred to as `` president '' in both the Persian and English languages .
