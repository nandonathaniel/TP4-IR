While territories such as Guam , the United States Virgin Islands , the Northern Mariana Islands , American Samoa and Puerto Rico remain under U.S. control , the U.S. allowed many of its overseas territories or occupations to gain independence after World War II . Examples include the Philippines ( 1946 ) , the Panama canal zone ( 1979 ) , Palau ( 1981 ) , the Federated States of Micronesia ( 1986 ) and the Marshall Islands ( 1986 ) . Most of them still have U.S. bases within their territories . In the case of Okinawa , which came under U.S. administration after the Battle of Okinawa during the Second World War , this happened despite local popular opinion . In 2003 , a Department of Defense distribution found the United States had bases in over 36 countries worldwide .
