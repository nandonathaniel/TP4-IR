Thiele 's reckoning is based on the presentation of Zedekiah 's reign on an accession basis , which he asserts was occasionally used for the kings of Judah . In that case , the year that Zedekiah came to the throne would be his zeroth year ; his first full year would be 597 / 596 BC , and his eleventh year , the year that Jerusalem fell , would be 587 / 586 BC . Since Judah 's regnal years were counted from Tishri in autumn , that would place the end of his reign and the capture of Jerusalem in the summer of 586 BC .
