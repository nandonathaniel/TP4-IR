There is no data available on demographic history or trends for Vaishnavism or other traditions within Hinduism . Estimates vary on the relative number of adherents in Vaishnavism compared to other traditions of Hinduism . Klaus Klostermaier and other scholars estimate Vaishnavism to be the largest . According to a 2010 estimate by Johnson and Grim , the Vaishnavism tradition is the largest group with about 641 million or 67.6 % of Hindus . In contrast , Jones and Ryan estimate Vaishnavism to have perhaps 200 million followers , and it being the second largest tradition of Hinduism after Shaivism . The denominations of Hinduism , states Julius Lipner , are unlike those found in major religions of the world , because Hindu denominations are fuzzy , individuals revere gods and goddesses polycentrically , with many Vaishnava adherents recognizing Sri ( Lakshmi ) , Shiva , Parvati and others reverentially on festivals and other occasions . Similarly , Shaiva , Shakta and Smarta Hindus revere Vishnu .
