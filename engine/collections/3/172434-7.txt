All - time record of 75 set by Will White in 1879 ; modern - era record of 48 set by Jack Chesbro in 1904 . Sports Illustrated has said about this record , `` Even if the bar is lowered to begin with the live - ball era ( which began in 1920 ) , the mark would still be untouchable . '' The most complete games recorded in a live - ball season is 33 , achieved three times in all -- twice at the dawn of that era by Grover Cleveland Alexander in 1920 and Burleigh Grimes in 1923 , and also by Dizzy Trout in 1944 , a season in which the player pool was severely depleted by World War II call - ups . According to SI , modern starters can expect to start about 34 games in a season .
