Dein described Wenger as the most important manager in the club 's history : `` Arsène 's a miracle worker . He 's revolutionised the club . He 's turned players into world - class players . Since he has been here , we have seen football from another planet '' . Former Watford manager Graham Taylor said of Wenger in 2002 : `` I believe his biggest contribution to football is getting across the idea that players have to prepare right and look after themselves '' . Wenger 's loyalty towards financial fair play and handling of Arsenal 's debt since their stadium move has earnt him praise , not least from American baseball general manager Billy Beane , who in particular lauded his transfer strategy . A survey in 2007 found Wenger was the only Premier League manager to have made a profit on transfers , and between 2004 and 2009 , he made an average profit of £ 4.4 million per season on transfers , far more than any other club .
