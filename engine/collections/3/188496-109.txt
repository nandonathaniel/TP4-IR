The Constitution is silent on the issue of the secession of a state from the union . However , its predecessor document , the Articles of Confederation , stated that the United States `` shall be perpetual . '' The question of whether or not individual states held the right to unilateral secession remained a difficult and divisive one until the American Civil War . In 1860 and 1861 , eleven southern states seceded , but following their defeat in the American Civil War were brought back into the Union during the Reconstruction Era . The federal government never recognized the secession of any of the rebellious states .
