One common tactic among consequentialists , particularly those committed to an altruistic ( selfless ) account of consequentialism , is to employ an ideal , neutral observer from which moral judgements can be made . John Rawls , a critic of utilitarianism , argues that utilitarianism , in common with other forms of consequentialism , relies on the perspective of such an ideal observer . The particular characteristics of this ideal observer can vary from an omniscient observer , who would grasp all the consequences of any action , to an ideally informed observer , who knows as much as could reasonably be expected , but not necessarily all the circumstances or all the possible consequences . Consequentialist theories that adopt this paradigm hold that right action is the action that will bring about the best consequences from this ideal observer 's perspective .
