New Drivers ( First license in Japan ) Valid for 2 to 3 years . Drivers with under one year of driving experience are required to display a `` Shoshinsha mark '' ( Young Leaf Mark ) on their vehicle . This holds true if the driver acquires a license for a different class of vehicle , regardless of the length of driving experience on their previous license . However , such a mark does not indicate necessarily the color on the driver 's license . A driver with a young leaf mark on their car could very well be a gold driver . This is because the gold status does not disappear with a change in vehicle class .
