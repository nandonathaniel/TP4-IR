Because the Ohio River flowed westward , it became a convenient means of westward movement by pioneers traveling from western Pennsylvania . After reaching the mouth of the Ohio , settlers would travel north on the Mississippi River to St. Louis , Missouri . There , some continued on up the Missouri River , some up the Mississippi , and some further west over land routes . In the early 19th century , river pirates such as Samuel Mason , operating out of Cave - In - Rock , Illinois , waylaid travelers on their way down the river . They killed travelers , stealing their goods and scuttling their boats . The folktales about Mike Fink recall the keelboats used for commerce in the early days of European settlement . The Ohio River boatmen were the inspiration for performer Dan Emmett , who in 1843 wrote the song `` The Boatman 's Dance '' .
