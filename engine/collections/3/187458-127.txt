Despite its poor performance at the American box office , Labyrinth was a success on home video and later on DVD . David Bowie told an interviewer in 1992 , `` every Christmas a new flock of children comes up to me and says , ' Oh ! you 're the one who 's in Labyrinth ! ' '' In 1997 , Jennifer Connelly said `` I still get recognized for Labyrinth by little girls in the weirdest places . I ca n't believe they still recognize me from that movie . It 's on TV all the time and I guess I pretty much look the same . ''
