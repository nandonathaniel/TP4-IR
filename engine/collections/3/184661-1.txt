The earliest art by Greeks is generally excluded from ancient Greek art , and instead known as Aegean art ; this includes Cycladic art and the art of the Minoan and Mycenaean cultures from the Greek Bronze Age . The art of ancient Greece is usually divided stylistically into four periods : the Geometric , Archaic , Classical , and Hellenistic . The Geometric age is usually dated from about 1000 BC , although in reality little is known about art in Greece during the preceding 200 years , traditionally known as the Greek Dark Ages . The 7th century BC witnessed the slow development of the Archaic style as exemplified by the black - figure style of vase painting . Around 500 BC , shortly before the onset of the Persian Wars ( 480 BC to 448 BC ) , is usually taken as the dividing line between the Archaic and the Classical periods , and the reign of Alexander the Great ( 336 BC to 323 BC ) is taken as separating the Classical from the Hellenistic periods . From some point in the 1st century BC onwards `` Greco - Roman '' is used , or more local terms for the Eastern Greek world .
