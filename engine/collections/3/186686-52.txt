Cortés and his army were permitted to stay in the Palace of Axayacatl , and tensions continued to grow . While the Spaniards were in Tenochtitlan , Velázquez assembled a force of nineteen ships , more than 1400 soldiers with twenty cannons , eighty horsemen , one - hundred and twenty crossbowmen , and eighty arquebusiers under the command of Pánfilo de Narváez to capture Cortés and return him to Cuba . Velázquez felt that Cortés had exceeded his authority , and had been aware of Cortés 's misconduct for nearly a year . He had to wait for favorable winds , though , and was unable to send any forces until spring . Narváez 's troops landed at San Juan de Ulúa on the Mexican coast around April 20 , 1520 .
