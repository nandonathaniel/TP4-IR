Hartsfield 's Landing is a fictional town in New Hampshire . It is stated to be a very small community of only 63 people , of whom 42 are registered voters , that votes at one minute past midnight on the day of the New Hampshire primary , hours before the rest of the state , and has accurately predicted the winner of every presidential election since William Howard Taft in 1908 . It is based on the true New Hampshire communities of Hart 's Location and Dixville Notch , which indeed vote before the rest of the state during the primaries , and also loosely upon the concept of `` bellwether states '' in US presidential elections .
