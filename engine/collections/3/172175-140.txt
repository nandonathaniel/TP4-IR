In Saudi Arabia , in 2002 and 2008 , religious police banned the sale of all Valentine 's Day items , telling shop workers to remove any red items , because the day is considered a Christian holiday . This ban has created a black market for roses and wrapping paper . In 2012 , the religious police arrested more than 140 Muslims for celebrating the holiday , and confiscated all red roses from flower shops . Muslims are not allowed to celebrate the holiday , and non-Muslims can celebrate only behind closed doors .
