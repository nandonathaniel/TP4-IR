Following the American Revolutionary War , the United States faced potential military conflict on the high seas as well as on the western frontier . The United States was a minor military power during this time , having only a modest army , marine corps , and navy . A traditional distrust of standing armies , combined with faith in the abilities of local militia , precluded the development of well - trained units and a professional officer corps . Jeffersonian leaders preferred a small army and navy , fearing that a large military establishment would involve the United States in excessive foreign wars , and potentially allow a domestic tyrant to seize power .
