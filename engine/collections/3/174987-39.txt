In the open ocean , the diatom ( spring ) bloom is typically ended by a shortage of silicon . Unlike other minerals , the requirement for silicon is unique to diatoms and it is not regenerated in the plankton ecosystem as efficiently as , for instance , nitrogen or phosphorus nutrients . This can be seen in maps of surface nutrient concentrations -- as nutrients decline along gradients , silicon is usually the first to be exhausted ( followed normally by nitrogen then phosphorus ) .
