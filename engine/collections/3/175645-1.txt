The Barro -- Gordon model shows how the ability of government to manipulate leads to inflationary bias . In this model , it is assumed that a nation will attempt to keep the unemployment rate below its natural level . This will create an inflation in wages above their natural level , which ultimately results in an overall rate of inflation that is higher than the natural rate of inflation .
