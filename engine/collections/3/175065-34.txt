Retrograde amnesia is most marked for events occurring in the weeks or months before treatment , with one study showing that although some people lose memories from years prior to treatment , recovery of such memories was `` virtually complete '' by seven months post-treatment , with the only enduring loss being memories in the weeks and months prior to the treatment . Anterograde memory loss is usually limited to the time of treatment itself or shortly afterwards . In the weeks and months following ECT these memory problems gradually improve , but some people have persistent losses , especially with bilateral ECT . One published review summarizing the results of questionnaires about subjective memory loss found that between 29 % and 55 % of respondents believed they experienced long - lasting or permanent memory changes . In 2000 , American psychiatrist Sarah Lisanby and colleagues found that bilateral ECT left patients with more persistently impaired memory of public events as compared to RUL ECT .
