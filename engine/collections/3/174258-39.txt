UCLA student Colin Higgins wrote Harold and Maude as his master 's thesis . While working as producer Edward Lewis ' pool boy , Higgins showed the script to Lewis 's wife , Mildred . Mildred was so impressed that she got Edward to give it to Stanley Jaffe at Paramount . Higgins sold the script with the understanding that he would direct the film but he was told he was n't ready , after tests he shot proved unsatisfactory to the studio heads . Ashby would only commit to directing the film after getting Higgins ' blessing and then , so Higgins could watch and learn from him on the set , Ashby made Higgins a co-producer . Higgins says he originally thought of the story as a play . It then became a 20 - minute thesis while at film school . After the film came out , the script was turned into a novel then a play , which ran for several years in Paris .
