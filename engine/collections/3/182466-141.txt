Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun - Times gave the film 4 out of 4 stars , saying : `` What will REALLY put a chill down your spine and raise the hairs on the back of your neck are the moments when an adolescent character is isolated from friends , all alone in the cellar or the bathroom or the alley or a dark office , and something they 've long feared springs to ' life ' in a certain fashion , confirming their worst sense of dread and doom . '' Andrew Barker of Variety praised the visuals and cast , while acknowledging the familiarities , calling the film `` a collection of alternately terrifying , hallucinatory , and ludicrous nightmare imagery ... a series of well - crafted yet decreasingly effective suspense setpieces ; and a series of well - acted coming - of - age sequences that do n't quite fully mature . '' Mark Kermode of The Guardian gave the film 4 out of 5 stars , writing that the film `` is an energetic romp with crowd - pleasing appeal that is n't afraid to bare its gory teeth '' . Christopher Orr of The Atlantic gave the film a mixed review , calling it `` a solid but relatively conventional horror movie '' and writing that it `` privileges CGI scares over dread and nuance '' .
