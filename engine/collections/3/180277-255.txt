In response to concerns that clubs were increasingly passing over young English players in favour of foreign players , in 1999 , the Home Office tightened its rules for granting work permits to players from countries outside of the European Union . A non-EU player applying for the permit must have played for his country in at least 75 per cent of its competitive ' A ' team matches for which he was available for selection during the previous two years , and his country must have averaged at least 70th place in the official FIFA world rankings over the previous two years . If a player does not meet those criteria , the club wishing to sign him may appeal .
