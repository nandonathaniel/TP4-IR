In 1968 , Colonel A.J. Barker , apparently using statistics from the fascist regime , wrote that from 1 January 1935 to 31 May 1936 , the Italian army and Blackshirt units lost 1,148 men killed , 125 men died of wounds and thirty - one missing ; about 1,593 Eritrean troops and 453 civilian workmen were also killed , a total of 3,319 casualties . In a 1978 publication , Alberto Sbacchi wrote that these official Italian casualty figures of about 3,000 were an underestimate . Sbacchi calculated that by May 1936 , 10,000 Italian soldiers had been killed and 44,000 had been wounded ; from 1936 to 1940 , there an additional 9,555 men killed and 144,000 sick and wounded . Total Italian casualties from 1935 to 1940 according to these calculations were about 208,000 killed or wounded . Based on 1,911 Italians killed in the first six months of 1940 , Ministry of Africa figures for 6 May 1936 to 10 June 1940 are 8,284 men killed , which Sbacchi considered to be fairly accurate . In Legacy of Bitterness : Ethiopia and Fascist Italy , 1935 -- 1941 ( 1997 ) , Sbacchi wrote that the official total of Italian casualties was unreliable , because the regime desired to underestimate Italian losses .
