Ronnie Cummins , national director of the United States Organic Consumers Association , said that Whole Foods Market simply uses the term natural as a marketing tool . Cummins concluded that `` Whole Foods Market now is a big - box retailer -- and it 's much more concerned about competing with the other big boxes than issues of ethics and sustainability . '' Similarly , researcher Stacy Mitchell of the New Rules Project argues that the corporation 's aggressive marketing of local food is more hype than substance .
