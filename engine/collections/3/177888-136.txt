Two major programs that permanently expanded the welfare state passed in 1919 and 1920 with surprisingly little debate , even as the Conservatives dominated parliament . The Housing and Town Planning Act of 1919 set up a system of government housing that followed the 1918 campaign promises of `` homes fit for heroes . '' The Addison Act , named after the first Minister of Health Doctor Christopher Addison , required local authorities to survey their housing needs , and start building houses to replace slums . The treasury subsidized the low rents . In England and Wales , 214,000 houses were built , and the Ministry of Health became largely a ministry of housing .
