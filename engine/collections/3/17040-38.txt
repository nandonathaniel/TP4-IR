The Moon crosses from south to north of the ecliptic at its ascending node , and vice versa at its descending node . However , the nodes of the Moon 's orbit are gradually moving in a retrograde motion , due to the action of the Sun 's gravity on the Moon 's motion , and they make a complete circuit every 18.6 years . This regression means that the time between each passage of the Moon through the ascending node is slightly shorter than the sidereal month . This period is called the nodical or draconic month .
