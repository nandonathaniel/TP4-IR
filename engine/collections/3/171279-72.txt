Ikutidaru is Akuram 's right hand man and probably the oldest of the surviving oni . Of all of the oni clan he has the greatest sense of conscience , and is often torn between his loyalty to his people and his love for Inori 's older sister Seri . In the anime , he once disobeyed Akuram and had his eye removed as punishment for the crime ( although in the manga it is not yet explained how he came to lose his eye ) . Despite the fact he does not always agree with the things Akuram orders , he often carries them out with resolute seriousness , even though at times it makes Kyou 's predicament worse . He has a strongly protective - almost paternal - instinct where Sefuru is concerned ( although Sefuru is rarely appreciative of that fact ) . In the ongoing manga , Ikutidaru is currently working with Akane and Yorihisa against Akuram as they try to break the curse Akuram has placed over them . His defection was inspired largely by the way in which Sefuru was injured by Akuram when he was discarded .
