The structure used for Columbus is based on the MPLM module built for NASA by Thales Alenia Space . In 2000 the pre-integrated module ( structure including harness and tubing ) was delivered to Bremen in Germany by the Co-prime contractor Alenia . The final integration and system testing was performed by the overall prime contractor EADS Astrium Space Transportation , after that the initial Payload was integrated and the overall complement checked - out .
