Angelou 's autobiographies , especially the first volume , have been used in narrative and multicultural approaches to teacher education . Jocelyn A. Glazier , a professor at George Washington University , has used Caged Bird and Gather Together in My Name when training teachers to appropriately explore racism in their classrooms . Angelou 's use of understatement , self - mockery , humor , and irony causes readers of Angelou 's autobiographies to wonder what she `` left out '' and to be unsure how to respond to the events Angelou describes . These techniques force white readers to explore their feelings about race and their privileged status in society . Glazier found that although critics have focused on where Angelou fits within the genre of African - American autobiography and her literary techniques , readers react to her storytelling with `` surprise , particularly when ( they ) enter the text with certain expectations about the genre of autobiography '' .
