The term `` politically correct '' was used infrequently until the latter part of the 20th century . This earlier use did not communicate the social disapproval usually implied in more recent usage . In 1793 , the term `` politically correct '' appeared in a U.S. Supreme Court judgment of a political lawsuit . The term also had use in other English - speaking countries in the 1800s . William Safire states that the first recorded use of the term in the typical modern sense is by Toni Cade Bambara in the 1970 anthology The Black Woman . The term probably entered use in the United Kingdom around 1975 .
