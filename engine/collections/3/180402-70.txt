Months before each Games , the Olympic Flame is lit in Olympia in a ceremony that reflects ancient Greek rituals . A female performer , acting as a priestess , ignites a torch by placing it inside a parabolic mirror which focuses the sun 's rays ; she then lights the torch of the first relay bearer , thus initiating the Olympic torch relay that will carry the flame to the host city 's Olympic stadium , where it plays an important role in the opening ceremony . Though the flame has been an Olympic symbol since 1928 , the torch relay was only introduced at the 1936 Summer Games to promote the Third Reich .
