Other writers , including Kelly , consider that Dickens put forward a `` secular vision of this sacred holiday '' . The Dickens scholar John O. Jordan argues that A Christmas Carol shows what Dickens referred to in a letter to Foster as his `` Carol philosophy , cheerful views , sharp anatomisation of humbug , jolly good temper ... and a vein of glowing , hearty , generous , mirthful , beaming reference in everything to Home and Fireside '' . From a secular viewpoint , the cultural historian Penne Restad suggests that Scrooge 's redemption underscores `` the conservative , individualistic and patriarchal aspects '' of Dickens 's `` Carol philosophy '' of charity and altruism .
