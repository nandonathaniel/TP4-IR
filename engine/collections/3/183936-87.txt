In the words of the philosopher Daniel Dennett , `` Darwin 's dangerous idea '' of evolution by natural selection is a `` universal acid , '' which can not be kept restricted to any vessel or container , as it soon leaks out , working its way into ever - wider surroundings . Thus , in the last decades , the concept of natural selection has spread from evolutionary biology to other disciplines , including evolutionary computation , quantum Darwinism , evolutionary economics , evolutionary epistemology , evolutionary psychology , and cosmological natural selection . This unlimited applicability has been called universal Darwinism .
