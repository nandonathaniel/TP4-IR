Radiative cooling is one of the few ways an object in space can give off energy . In particular , white dwarf stars are no longer generating energy by fusion or gravitational contraction , and have no solar wind . So the only way their temperature changes is by radiative cooling . This makes their temperature as a function of age very predictable , so by observing the temperature , astronomers can deduce the age of the star .
