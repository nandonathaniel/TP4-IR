The size of a block of addresses is specified by writing a slash ( / ) followed by a number in decimal whose value is the length of the network prefix in bits , rather than by explicitly specifying which addresses are in the block . For example , an address block with 48 bits in the prefix is indicated by / 48 . Such a block contains 2 = 2 addresses . The smaller the value of the network prefix , the larger the block : a / 21 block is 8 times larger than a / 24 block .
