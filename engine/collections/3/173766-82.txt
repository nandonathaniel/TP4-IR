In 1819 , Vandalia became the capital , and over the next 18 years , three separate buildings were built to serve successively as the capitol building . In 1837 , the state legislators representing Sangamon County , under the leadership of state representative Abraham Lincoln , succeeded in having the capital moved to Springfield , where a fifth capitol building was constructed .
