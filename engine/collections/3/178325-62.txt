However , this first golden period for NBC daytime proved to be short - lived , as Days of Our Lives ' ratings began to decline in 1977 . Much of the decline was due to ABC 's expansion of its increasingly popular soap All My Children to a full hour , the last half of which overlapped with the first half of Days of Our Lives By January 1979 , the network , in a mode of desperation more than anything else , decided to jump headlong against AMC and moved the show ahead to the same 1 : 00 p.m. / 12 Noon time slot . In exchange to its affiliates for taking away the old half - hour access slot at 1 : 00 / Noon , NBC gave them the 4 p.m. / 3 slot , which many ( if not most ) stations had been preempting for years anyway . By 1986 , ABC and CBS followed suit , under the intense pressure of lucrative ( and cheap ) syndicated programming offered to affiliates .
