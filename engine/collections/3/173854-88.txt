When FEMA called for firefighters for `` community service and outreach , '' 2000 highly trained firefighters showed up in a staging area in an Atlanta hotel , believing that their skills would be used , or would better be used , for search and rescue operations . The firefighters , who were all paid by FEMA for their time , found themselves undergoing training on community relations , watching videos , and attending seminars on sexual harassment in a hotel , waiting days , in some cases , to be deployed in a secretarial or public relations position . Some firefighters called it a misallocation of resources , others were simply frustrated at the delay . FEMA defended itself by saying that there was no urgency for the firefighters to arrive because they were primarily going to be involved in community relations work , not search and rescue , and their call for help stated this .
