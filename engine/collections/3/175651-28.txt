During 2019 , income groups earning under $20,000 ( about 23 % of taxpayers ) would contribute to deficit reduction ( i.e. incur a cost ) , mainly by receiving fewer subsidies due to the repeal of the individual mandate of the Affordable Care Act . Other groups would contribute to deficit increases ( i.e. receive a benefit ) , mainly due to tax cuts .
