The quartet has superficial resemblances to Debussy 's String Quartet , written ten years earlier . Debussy approved of his younger colleague 's work , and sent him an encouraging letter . Ravel 's quartet is modelled on Debussy 's as far as the structure is concerned , but where Debussy 's music is , in Orenstein 's words , `` effusive , uninhibited , and open ( ing ) up fresh paths '' , Ravel 's music displays emotional reticence , innovation within traditional forms , and unrivalled technical mastery . Ravel followed a direction he described as `` opposite to that of Debussy 's symbolism '' , abandoning `` the vagueness and formlessness of the early French impressionists in favour of a return to classic standards .
