Australia recovered relatively quickly from the financial downturn of 1929 -- 1930 , with recovery beginning around 1932 . The Prime Minister , Joseph Lyons , favoured the tough economic measures of the Premiers ' Plan , pursued an orthodox fiscal policy and refused to accept the proposals of the Premier of New South Wales , Jack Lang , to default on overseas debt repayments . According to author Anne Henderson of the Sydney Institute , Lyons held a steadfast belief in `` the need to balance budgets , lower costs to business and restore confidence '' and the Lyons period gave Australia `` stability and eventual growth '' between the drama of the Depression and the outbreak of the Second World War . A lowering of wages was enforced and industry tariff protections maintained , which together with cheaper raw materials during the 1930s saw a shift from agriculture to manufacturing as the chief employer of the Australian economy -- a shift which was consolidated by increased investment by the commonwealth government into defence and armaments manufacture . Lyons saw restoration of Australia 's exports as the key to economic recovery .
