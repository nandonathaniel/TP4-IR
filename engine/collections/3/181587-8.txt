A number of television shows , both regular series and one - off specials from around the world , have been judged to be among the worst to have ever been produced . Factors that can reflect poorly on a television series include inherently poor quality , the lack of a budget , rapid cancellation , very low viewership , offensive content , and / or negative impact on other series on the same channel . In some cases , a show that is acceptable on its own merits can be put in a position where it does not belong and be judged `` worst ever . ''
