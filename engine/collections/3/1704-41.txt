The writings of Avicenna , Ibn Tufail , and Aquinas on the tabula rasa theory stood unprogressed and untested for several centuries . For example , the late medieval English jurist Sir John Fortescue , in his work In Praise of the Laws of England ( Chapter VI ) , takes for granted the notion of tabula rasa , stressing it as the basis of the need for the education of the young in general , and of young princes specifically . `` Therefore , Prince , whilst you are young and your mind is as it were a clean slate , impress on it these things , lest in future it be impressed more pleasurably with images of lesser worth . '' ( His igitur , Princeps , dum Adolescens es , et Anima tua velut Tabula rasa , depinge eam , ne in futurum ipsa Figuris minoris Frugi delectabilius depingatur . )
