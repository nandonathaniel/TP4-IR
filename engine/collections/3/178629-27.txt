The first time a survivor is hooked , they enter the first phase . In this phase only , the player can try for a low ( 4 % ) chance of escaping the hook at the cost of accelerating their death upon failure to escape based on their ' hook health ' ( at full , granting up to four chances ) . Players can also be rescued by fellow survivors . If the player escapes or is saved and is hooked a second time , they will enter the struggle state , in which the player has to resist the entity trying to stab him / her by pressing the spacebar continuously until saved by an ally or killed by the ' Entity ' . If the player is saved during the struggle state and is hooked a third time , they will die instantly with no opportunity of survival .
