Aspartame was discovered in 1965 by James M. Schlatter at the G.D. Searle company . He was working on an anti-ulcer drug and accidentally spilled some aspartame on his hand . When he licked his finger , he noticed that it had a sweet taste . Torunn Atteraas Garin oversaw the development of aspartame as an artificial sweetener . It is an odorless , white crystalline powder that is derived from the two amino acids aspartic acid and phenylalanine . It is about 200 times as sweet as sugar and can be used as a tabletop sweetener or in frozen desserts , gelatins , beverages , and chewing gum . When cooked or stored at high temperatures , aspartame breaks down into its constituent amino acids . This makes aspartame undesirable as a baking sweetener . It is more stable in somewhat acidic conditions , such as in soft drinks . Though it does not have a bitter aftertaste like saccharin , it may not taste exactly like sugar . When eaten , aspartame is metabolized into its original amino acids . Because it is so intensely sweet , relatively little of it is needed to sweeten a food product , and is thus useful for reducing the number of calories in a product .
