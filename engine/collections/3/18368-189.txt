The FN grade indicates that a student has failed a course due to non-attendance . It is calculated as an `` F '' in the student 's grade point average . For students receiving financial aid , failure for non-attendance may require the student to refund to the College all or part of his or her aid . The FN grade will be assigned by the faculty member at any time following the final withdrawal date for the course . Students who are in a failing status because of non-attendance but return to the course prior to the withdrawal date may elect to withdraw from the course .
