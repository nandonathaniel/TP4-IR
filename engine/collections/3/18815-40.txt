Fifty Shades trilogy has also attracted criticism due to its depictions of BDSM , with Katie Roiphe of Newsweek asking `` But why , for women especially , would free will be a burden ? ... It may be that power is not always that comfortable , even for those of us who grew up in it ; it may be that equality is something we want only sometimes and in some places and in some arenas ; it may be that power and all of its imperatives can be boring . '' Zap2it 's Andrea Reiher expressed frustration at Roiphe 's depiction of the series , stating that `` ( b ) eing submissive sexually is not tantamount to being the victim of abuse '' or that they 're `` giving up their power or their equality with their partner '' . Other sites such as Jezebel have responded to the article , with Jezebel listing reasons for Fifty Shades of Grey 's popularity , stating that `` the vast majority of fans fawn over the emotional relationship Anastasia and Christian have , not about the sex .
