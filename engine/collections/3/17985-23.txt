In 1932 , Rosa married Raymond Parks , a barber from Montgomery . He was a member of the NAACP , which at the time was collecting money to support the defense of the Scottsboro Boys , a group of black men falsely accused of raping two white women . Rosa took numerous jobs , ranging from domestic worker to hospital aide . At her husband 's urging , she finished her high school studies in 1933 , at a time when less than 7 % of African Americans had a high school diploma .
