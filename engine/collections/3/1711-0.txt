A troubadour ( English : / ˈtruːbədʊər / , French : ( tʁubaduʁ ) ; Occitan : trobador , IPA : ( tɾuβaˈðu ) ) was a composer and performer of Old Occitan lyric poetry during the High Middle Ages ( 1100 -- 1350 ) . Since the word troubadour is etymologically masculine , a female troubadour is usually called a trobairitz .
