To perform this exam the person will be asked to drink a tasteless liquid which contains the carbon as part of the substance that the bacteria breaks down . After an hour , the person will be asked to blow into a bag that is sealed . If the person is infected with H. pylori , the breath sample will contain radioactive carbon dioxide . This test provides the advantage of being able to monitor the response to treatment used to kill the bacteria .
