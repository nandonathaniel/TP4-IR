The big loser under the new system was the City of Paris , which had dominated events in the first part of the Revolution . On 24 August 1794 , the committees of the sections of Paris , the bastions of the Jacobins , which had provided most of the manpower for demonstrations and invasions of the Convention , were abolished . Shortly afterwards , on 31 August , the municipality of Paris , which had been the domain of Danton and Robespierre , was abolished , and the city placed under direct control of the national government . When the Law of 19 Vend√©miaire Year IV ( 11 October 1795 ) , in application of the new Constitution , created the first twelve arrondissements of Paris , it established twelve new committees , one for each arrondissement . The city became a new department , the department of the Seine , replacing the former department of Paris created in 1790 .
