It is taken for granted by everybody that , had it been a white father on trial on identical charges , an acquittal would have been a certain and foregone verdict . The only real question at issue is whether or not such a socially - recognized right of private revenge would also apply to a black father taking revenge on white rapists . This makes it an issue of racial equality , getting it a nationwide interest and making the NAACP intervene on one side and the Ku Klux Klan on the other . Also , during deliberations the question of Carl Lee 's sanity , which in theory should have been the paramount consideration in fact has only a marginal place . The jurors ' deadlock is broken when a female juror makes an emotional appeal to her fellow jurors , asking them to imagine how they would have ruled if `` a white ten years old girl , blond and blue - eyed '' had been raped and brutalized by two drunken blacks . All jurors viscerally agree that in such a case they would have acquitted a vengeful white father , which leads them to agree that a black father deserves the same verdict .
