Resolution 1441 gave Iraq `` a final opportunity to comply with its disarmament obligations '' and set up inspections by the United Nations Monitoring , Verification and Inspection Commission ( UNMOVIC ) and the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) . Saddam accepted the resolution on 13 November and inspectors returned to Iraq under the direction of UNMOVIC chairman Hans Blix and IAEA Director General Mohamed ElBaradei . As of February 2003 , the IAEA `` found no evidence or plausible indication of the revival of a nuclear weapons program in Iraq '' ; the IAEA concluded that certain items which could have been used in nuclear enrichment centrifuges , such as aluminum tubes , were in fact intended for other uses . UNMOVIC `` did not find evidence of the continuation or resumption of programs of weapons of mass destruction '' or significant quantities of proscribed items . UNMOVIC did supervise the destruction of a small number of empty chemical rocket warheads , 50 liters of mustard gas that had been declared by Iraq and sealed by UNSCOM in 1998 , and laboratory quantities of a mustard gas precursor , along with about 50 Al - Samoud missiles of a design that Iraq stated did not exceed the permitted 150 km range , but which had travelled up to 183 km in tests . Shortly before the invasion , UNMOVIC stated that it would take `` months '' to verify Iraqi compliance with resolution 1441 .
