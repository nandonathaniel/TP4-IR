It was common for the young Mayweather to come home from school and find used heroin needles in his front yard . His mother was addicted to drugs , and he had an aunt who died from AIDS because of her drug use . `` People do n't know the hell I 've been through , '' he says . The most time that his father spent with him was taking him to the gym to train and work on his boxing , according to Mayweather . `` I do n't remember him ever taking me anywhere or doing anything that a father would do with a son , going to the park or to the movies or to get ice cream , '' he says . `` I always thought that he liked his daughter ( Floyd 's older sister ) better than he liked me because she never got whippings and I got whippings all the time .
