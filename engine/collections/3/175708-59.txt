Shaw returned to the theatre with what he called `` a political extravaganza '' , The Apple Cart , written in late 1928 . It was , in Ervine 's view , unexpectedly popular , taking a conservative , monarchist , anti-democratic line that appealed to contemporary audiences . The premiere was in Warsaw in June 1928 , and the first British production was two months later , at Sir Barry Jackson 's inaugural Malvern Festival . The other eminent creative artist most closely associated with the festival was Sir Edward Elgar , with whom Shaw enjoyed a deep friendship and mutual regard . He described The Apple Cart to Elgar as `` a scandalous Aristophanic burlesque of democratic politics , with a brief but shocking sex interlude '' .
