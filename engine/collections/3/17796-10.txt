In 1964 , IBM introduced its IBM System / 360 computer architecture that was used in a series of computers capable of running the same programs with different speed and performance . This was significant at a time when most electronic computers were incompatible with one another , even those made by the same manufacturer . To facilitate this improvement , IBM used the concept of a microprogram ( often called `` microcode '' ) , which still sees widespread usage in modern CPUs . The System / 360 architecture was so popular that it dominated the mainframe computer market for decades and left a legacy that is still continued by similar modern computers like the IBM zSeries . In 1965 , Digital Equipment Corporation ( DEC ) introduced another influential computer aimed at the scientific and research markets , the PDP - 8 .
