The term solstice can also be used in a broader sense , as the day when this occurs . The day of a solstice in either hemisphere has either the most sunlight of the year ( summer solstice ) or the least sunlight of the year ( winter solstice ) for any place other than the Equator . Alternative terms , with no ambiguity as to which hemisphere is the context , are `` June solstice '' and `` December solstice '' , referring to the months in which they take place every year .
