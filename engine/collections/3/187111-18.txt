The presence of photoreceptor cell types in an organism 's eyes do not directly imply that they are being used to functionally perceive color . Measuring functional spectral discrimination in non-human animals is challenging due to the difficulty in performing psychophysical experiments on creatures with limited behavioral repertoires who can not respond using language . Limitations in the discriminative ability of shrimp having twelve distinct color photoreceptors have demonstrated that having more cell types in itself need not always correlate with better functional color vision .
