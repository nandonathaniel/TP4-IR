Further investigation of icaR mRNA ( mRNA coding for the repressor of the main expolysaccharidic compound of the bacteria biofilm matrix ) demonstrated that the 3'UTR binding to the 5 ' UTR can interfere with the translation initiation complex and generate a double stranded substrate for RNase III . It was shown that the interaction is between the UCCCCUG motif in the 3'UTR and the Shine - Dalagarno region at the 5'UTR . Deletion of the motif resulted in IcaR repressor accumulation and inhibition of biofilm development . The biofilm formation is the main cause of Staphylococcus implant infections .
