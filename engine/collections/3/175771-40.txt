Societies and groups can differ in the extent to which they are based upon predominantly `` self - regarding '' ( individualistic , and / or self - interested ) behaviors , rather than `` other - regarding '' ( group - oriented , and group , or society - minded ) behaviors . Ruth Benedict made a distinction , relevant in this context , between `` guilt '' societies ( e.g. , medieval Europe ) with an `` internal reference standard '' , and `` shame '' societies ( e.g. , Japan , `` bringing shame upon one 's ancestors '' ) with an `` external reference standard '' , where people look to their peers for feedback on whether an action is `` acceptable '' or not ( also known as `` group - think '' ) .
