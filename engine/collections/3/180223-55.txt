In interviews , Cindy Morgan stated that the scene she shared with Chevy Chase , in which he pours massage oil on her , was completely improvised , and her reaction to Chase dousing her back with the massage oil , where she exclaimed `` You 're crazy ! '' , was genuine . The scene where her character had to dive into the pool was executed by a professional diver , but up to that point in the scene , she had to be led to the diving board by the crew and carefully directed up the ladder since she could not wear her contact lenses near the pool and was legally blind without them .
