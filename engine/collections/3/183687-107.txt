The song `` The Jitterbug '' , written in a swing style , was intended for the sequence in which the group is journeying to the Witch 's castle . Due to time constraints , the song was cut from the final theatrical version . The film footage for the song has been lost , although silent home film footage of rehearsals for the number has survived . The sound recording for the song , however , is intact and was included in the two - CD Rhino Records deluxe edition of the film soundtrack , as well as on the VHS and DVD editions of the film . A reference to `` The Jitterbug '' remains in the film : the Witch remarks to her flying monkeys that they should have no trouble apprehending Dorothy and her friends because `` I 've sent a little insect on ahead to take the fight out of them .
