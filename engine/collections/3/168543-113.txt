Infrequently , X and Q grades are awarded . X indicates that a course was not completed in full , and thus that an appropriate grade can not be calculated . The Q ( query ) grade is a temporary grade that requires the school to contract the examining body . These latter two grades are both usually provisional , and are replaced with a regular grade once any issues have been resolved . X grades are also sometimes used for other purposes , on rare occasions , such as to indicate that an examiner found offensive material or hate speech within a student 's responses . In some cases , this may lead to the student losing all marks for that paper or course . These grades are most common in subjects which discuss ethical issues , such as biology , religious studies , and citizenship .
