President Truman 's Executive Order 10340 in Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer , 343 US 579 ( 1952 ) placed all steel mills in the country under federal control . This was found invalid because it attempted to make law , rather than clarify or act to further a law put forth by the Congress or the Constitution . Presidents since this decision have generally been careful to cite which specific laws they are acting under when issuing new executive orders . Likewise , when presidents believe their authority for issuing an executive order stems from within the powers outlined in the Constitution , the order will simply proclaim `` under the authority vested in me by the Constitution '' instead .
