In June 2012 , the G - Class received some minor modifications to the specification and engine range . The significant changes on the outside are LED running lights and new side mirrors with integrated turn signals ( coinciding with the current design of side mirrors for Mercedes - Benz ) ; also , the AMG has a new bumper and grille . The majority of the G - Class 's upgrades reside under its hood and behind its doors : a new interior and more modern amenities . Interior changes include a re-sculpted dashboard and center console with a relocated COMAND screen and a new colour multifunction screen added to the gauge cluster . The latest MBrace2 telematics system is also on board and now comes standard with DISTRONIC adaptive cruise control , blind - spot monitoring and updated PARKTRONIC backup sensors and rearview camera , together with a revised stability control to enable trailer stabilizing functionality .
