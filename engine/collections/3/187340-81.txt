Comment : First of all , there is no `` Federal Court of Appeals for the 9th District '' ; there is a 9th Circuit , but no 9th District because all of the U.S. District courts are entirely contained within individual states . There is also no court formally titled as a `` Federal Court of Appeals '' . They are each a United States Court of Appeals . Perhaps you have a case before the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ? If so , your theory will be validated simply by winning your case . I assume that you are before the Court of Appeals because you lost in the District Court , meaning that someone with more legal knowledge than yourself has already rejected your position . bd2412 T 12 : 56 , 29 July 2016 ( UTC )
