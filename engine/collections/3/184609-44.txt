Admission to a movie may also be restricted by a motion picture rating system , typically due to depictions of sex , nudity or graphic violence . According to such systems , children or teenagers below a certain age may be forbidden access to theaters showing certain movies , or only admitted when accompanied by a parent or other adult . In some jurisdictions , a rating may legally impose these age restrictions on movie theaters . Furthermore , where movie theaters do not have this legal obligation , they may enforce restrictions on their own . Accordingly , a movie theater may either not be allowed to program an unrated film , or voluntarily refrain from that .
