Some Hindus choose to live a monastic life ( Sannyāsa ) in pursuit of liberation ( moksha ) or another form of spiritual perfection . Monastics commit themselves to a simple and celibate life , detached from material pursuits , of meditation and spiritual contemplation . A Hindu monk is called a Sanyāsī , Sādhu , or Swāmi . A female renunciate is called a Sanyāsini . Renunciates receive high respect in Hindu society because of their simple ahimsa - driven lifestyle and dedication to spiritual liberation ( moksha ) -- believed to be the ultimate goal of life in Hinduism . Some monastics live in monasteries , while others wander from place to place , depending on donated food and charity for their needs .
