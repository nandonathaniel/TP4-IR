The current monarch , Abdullah II , ascended to the throne in February 1999 after the death of his father Hussein . Abdullah re-affirmed Jordan 's commitment to the peace treaty with Israel and its relations with the United States . He refocused the government 's agenda on economic reform , during his first year . King Abdullah 's eldest son , Prince Hussein , is the current Crown Prince of Jordan . The current prime minister is Hani Al - Mulki who received his position on 29 May 2016 . Abdullah had announced his intentions of turning Jordan into a parliamentary system , where the largest bloc in parliament forms a government . However , the underdevelopment of political parties in the country have hampered such moves . Jordan has around 50 political parties representing nationalist , leftist , Islamist , and liberal ideologies . Political parties contested a fifth of the seats in the 2016 elections , the remainder belonging to independent politicians .
