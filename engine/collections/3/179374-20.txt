A variation of clay animation was developed by another Vinton animator , Craig Bartlett , for his series of Arnold short films ( also made in the late - 1980s / early - 1990s ) , in which he not only used clay painting but sometimes built up clay images that rose off the plane of the flat support platform toward the camera lens to give a more 3 - D stop - motion look to his films .
