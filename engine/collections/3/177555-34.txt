During the 19th century these characters were adapted to the Greek language and culture , Karag√∂z and Hacivat becoming Karagiozis and Hadjiavatis with each of the characters assuming stereotypically Greek personalities . This tradition thrived throughout Greece after independence as popular entertainment for a largely adult audience , particularly before competition arose from television . The stories did , however , retain the period setting in the late years of the Ottoman Empire . Karagiozis theatre has undergone some revival in recent years , with the intended audience tending to be largely juvenile .
