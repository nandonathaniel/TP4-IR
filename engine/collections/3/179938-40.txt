The move towards a merger picked up in 1977 when John Ziegler succeeded Campbell as NHL president . After several years of negotiations , WHA owners thought they had an agreement in March 1979 . The motion to merge failed when supporters in the NHL lost by one vote . Word got out that the Montreal Canadiens , owned by Molson Brewery , and the Vancouver Canucks , who served Molson products at their games , had voted against the merger . Fans across Canada quickly organized a boycott of Molson products , while the House of Commons unanimously passed a motion urging the NHL to reconsider . Another vote was held , and both Montreal and Vancouver switched their votes , allowing the motion to pass . The WHA folded following the 1978 -- 79 season , and the Edmonton Oilers , New England Whalers , Quebec Nordiques and Winnipeg Jets joined the NHL as expansion teams .
