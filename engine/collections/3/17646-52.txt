Belshazzar 's feast is a legend , conforming to the subgenre of the `` tale of court contest '' . This has been complicated by the inclusion of Daniel 's indictment of Belshazzar 's pride and his failure to honour the God of Israel ; as a result the tale has a double ending , in which Daniel is first showered with rewards and honours for interpreting the omen , and the king is then punished to fulfill the sentence pronounced by Daniel .
