The metric system is also extensible , and new base and derived units are defined as needed in fields such as radiology and chemistry . The most recent derived unit was added in 1999 . Recent changes are directed toward defining base units in terms of invariant constants of physics to provide more precise realisations of units for advances in science and industry .
