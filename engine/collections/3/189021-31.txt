The atmospheric lifetime of a species therefore measures the time required to restore equilibrium following a sudden increase or decrease in its concentration in the atmosphere . Individual atoms or molecules may be lost or deposited to sinks such as the soil , the oceans and other waters , or vegetation and other biological systems , reducing the excess to background concentrations . The average time taken to achieve this is the mean lifetime .
