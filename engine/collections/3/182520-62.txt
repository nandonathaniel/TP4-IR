Even though Candy Moore , Jimmy Garrett , and Ralph Hart were still contracted to the series , they were used minimally during the third year . For example , in the episode `` Lucy and The Old Mansion '' , which was the final Season 3 installment , filmed in January 1965 , Moore , Garrett , and Hart appear in the opening scene , have a few lines of dialogue , then exit . It is the last time in which all of the three children are seen , and they were subsequently written out in Season 4 . Dropping Candy Moore , in fact , was Ball 's decision . Because Moore was very popular with teenagers and the subject of dozens of articles in youth - oriented magazines at the time , her departure was originally nixed by CBS but finally accepted when Ball threatened to `` retire '' .
