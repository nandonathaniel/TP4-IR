While developing the character designs for Lelouch , the protagonist of the series , Clamp had originally conceived of his hair color as being white . Ageha Ohkawa , head writer at Clamp , said she had visualized him as being a character to which `` everyone '' could relate to as being `` cool '' , literally , a `` beauty '' . During these planning stages , Clamp and the Sunrise staff had discussed a number of possible inspirations for the characters , including KinKi Kids and Tackey & Tsubasa . They had wanted to create a `` hit show , '' a series which would appeal to `` everyone . '' Lelouch 's alter ego , Zero , was one of the earliest developed characters , with ÅŒkouchi having wanted a mask to be included as a part of the series , feeling it was necessary for it to be a Sunrise show , and Clamp wanting a unique design never prior seen in any Sunrise series ( said mask was nicknamed `` tulip '' for its distinctive design ) .
