In 1948 , Earl Shaffer of York , Pennsylvania , brought a great deal of attention to the project by publicizing the first claimed thru - hike . The claim was later criticized for the hike 's omission of significant portions due to short - cuts and car rides . Shaffer later claimed the first north - to - south thru - hike , the first to claim to do so in each direction . Chester Dziengielewski was later to be named the first south bound thru - hiker . In 1998 , Shaffer , nearly 80 years old , hiked the trail , making him the oldest person to claim a completed thru - hike . The first solo woman to complete the hike was 67 - year old Emma Gatewood who completed the northbound trek in 1955 , taking 146 days . She repeated the achievement two years later .
