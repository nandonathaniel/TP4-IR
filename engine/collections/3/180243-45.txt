Xuanzang was a contemporary and an esteemed guest of Harsha and catalogued the emperor 's munificence in some detail . According to Xuanzang 's biographer , Hwui - Li , Nalanda was held in contempt by some Sthaviras for its emphasis on Mahayana philosophy . They reportedly chided King Harsha for patronising Nalanda during one of his visits to Odisha , mocking the `` sky - flower '' philosophy taught there and suggesting that he might as well patronise a Kapalika temple . When this occurred , Harsha notified the chancellor of Nalanda , who sent the monks Sagaramati , Prajnyarashmi , Simharashmi , and Xuanzang to refute the views of the monks from Odisha .
