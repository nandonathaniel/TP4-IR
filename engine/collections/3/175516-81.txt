The situation intensified further in early 1873 when the Burns family were killed by a Kai Colo raid in the Ba River area . The Cakobau government deployed 50 King 's Troopers to the region under the command of Major Fitzgerald to restore order . The local whites , with their own large force under the leadership of Mr White and Mr de Courcy Ireland , refused their posting and a further deployment of another 50 troops under Captain Harding was sent to emphasise the government 's authority . To prove the worth of the Native Regiment , this augmented force went into the interior and massacred about 170 Kai Colo people at Na Korowaiwai . Upon returning to the coast , the force were met by the white settlers who still saw the government troops as a threat . A skirmish between the government 's troops and the white settlers ' brigade was only prevented by the timely intervention of Captain William Cox Chapman of HMS Dido who promptly detained Mr White and Mr de Courcy Ireland , forcing the group to disband . The authority of the King 's Troops and the Cakobau government to crush the Kai Colo was now total .
