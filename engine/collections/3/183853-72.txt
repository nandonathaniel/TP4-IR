King Ramses is the ghost of a pharaoh from ancient Egypt . Two cat grave robbers steal a slab ( decorated with images of King Ramses and pictures corresponding to each of his three curses ) from his tomb and flee to Nowhere , but Ramses appears and demands the return of his slab . They refuse , so Ramses summons a swarm of locusts . He later attacks the farm when Courage finds the slab and Eustace refuses to return it after discovering it is worth a fortune , summoning a flood , bad music , and locusts . Eustace finally gives in and Courage throws the slab out of the house . After Eustace reclaims it , Ramses unleashes one final curse that imprisons Eustace in the slab as it is returned to Ramses 's crypt the next day .
