Flood - control measures are taken by water resource department and the Brahmaputra Board , but until now the flood problem remains unsolved . At least a third of the land of Majuli island has been eroded by the river . Recently , it is suggested that a highway protected by concrete mat along the river bank and excavation of the river bed can curb this menace . This project , named the Brahmaputra River Restoration Project , is yet to be implemented by the government. Recently the Central Government approved the construction of Brahmaputra Express Highways .
