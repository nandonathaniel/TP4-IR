Ludwik Hirszfeld and E. von Dungern discovered the heritability of ABO blood groups in 1910 -- 11 . Felix Bernstein demonstrated the correct blood group inheritance pattern of multiple alleles at one locus in 1924 . Watkins and Morgan , in England , discovered that the ABO epitopes were conferred by sugars , to be specific , N - acetylgalactosamine for the A-type and galactose for the B - type . After much published literature claiming that the ABH substances were all attached to glycosphingolipids , Finne et al. ( 1978 ) found that the human erythrocyte glycoproteins contain polylactosamine chains that contains ABH substances attached and represent the majority of the antigens . The main glycoproteins carrying the ABH antigens were identified to be the Band 3 and Band 4.5 proteins and glycophorin . Later , Yamamoto 's group showed the precise glycosyl transferase set that confers the A , B and O epitopes .
