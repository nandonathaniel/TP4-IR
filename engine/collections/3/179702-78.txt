The leading educational theorist of the era was John Dewey ( 1859 -- 1952 ) , a philosophy professor at the University of Chicago ( 1894 -- 1904 ) and at Teachers College ( 1904 to 1930 ) , of Columbia University in New York City . Dewey was a leading proponent of `` Progressive Education '' and wrote many books and articles to promote the central role of democracy in education . He believed that schools were not only a place for students to gain content knowledge , but also as a place for them to learn how to live . The purpose of education was thus to realize the student 's full potential and the ability to use those skills for the greater good .
