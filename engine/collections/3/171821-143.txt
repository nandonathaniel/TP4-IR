A later series , The Famous Five , initiated by Victor Glynn of Portman Zenith was aired first in 1995 , a co-production between a number of companies including Tyne Tees Television , HTV , Zenith North and the German channel ZDF . Unlike the previous TV series , this set the stories in the 1950s , around when they were written . It dramatised all the original books . Of the juvenile actors the best known is probably Jemima Rooper , who played George . Julian was portrayed by Marco Williamson , Dick by Paul Child , and Anne by Laura Petela . In this series , because of the slang meaning of the word fanny , Aunt Fanny , played by Mary Waterhouse , was known as Aunt Frances . ( In some but not all recent reprints of the book , the character has been re-christened Aunt Franny . )
