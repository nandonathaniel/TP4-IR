While Mark 4 : 33 -- 34 and Matthew 13 : 34 -- 35 may suggest that Jesus would only speak to the `` crowds '' in parables , while in private explaining everything to his disciples , modern scholars do not support the private explanations argument and surmise that Jesus used parables as a teaching method . Dwight Pentecost suggests that given that Jesus often preached to a mixed audience of believers and non-believers , he used parables to reveal the truth to some , but hide it from others .
