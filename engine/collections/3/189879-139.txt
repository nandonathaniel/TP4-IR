Various episodes of the show have generated controversy . The Simpsons visit Australia in `` Bart vs. Australia '' ( season six , 1995 ) and Brazil in `` Blame It on Lisa '' ( season 13 , 2002 ) and both episodes generated controversy and negative reaction in the visited countries . In the latter case , Rio de Janeiro 's tourist board -- which claimed that the city was portrayed as having rampant street crime , kidnappings , slums , and monkey and rat infestations -- went so far as to threaten Fox with legal action . Groening was a fierce and vocal critic of the episode `` A Star Is Burns '' ( season six , 1995 ) which featured a crossover with The Critic . He felt that it was just an advertisement for The Critic , and that people would incorrectly associate the show with him . When he was unsuccessful in getting the episode pulled , he had his name removed from the credits and went public with his concerns , openly criticizing James L. Brooks and saying the episode `` violates the Simpsons ' universe . '' In response , Brooks said , `` I am furious with Matt , ... he 's allowed his opinion , but airing this publicly in the press is going too far ... his behavior right now is rotten . ''
