Ideally the shutter opens instantaneously , remains open as long as required , and closes instantaneously . This is essentially the case at slower speeds , but as speeds approach their maximum the shutter is far from fully open for a significant part of the exposure time . Effectively the shutter acts as an additional aperture , and may , for example , cause vignetting or increase depth of field , undesirable if shallow focus is being used creatively .
