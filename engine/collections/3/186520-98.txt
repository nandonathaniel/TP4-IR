Some countries do not recognize locally performed religious marriage on its own , and require a separate civil marriage for official purposes . Conversely , civil marriage does not exist in some countries governed by a religious legal system , such as Saudi Arabia , where marriages contracted abroad might not be recognized if they were contracted contrary to Saudi interpretations of Islamic religious law . In countries governed by a mixed secular - religious legal system , such as in Lebanon and Israel , locally performed civil marriage also does not exist within the country , preventing interfaith and various other marriages contradicting religious laws from being entered into in the country , however , civil marriages performed abroad are recognized by the state even if they conflict with religious laws ( in the case of recognition of marriage in Israel , this includes recognition of not only interfaith civil marriages performed abroad , but also overseas same - sex civil marriages ) .
