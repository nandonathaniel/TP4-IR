In England , mercantilism reached its peak during the Long Parliament government ( 1640 -- 60 ) . Mercantilist policies were also embraced throughout much of the Tudor and Stuart periods , with Robert Walpole being another major proponent . In Britain , government control over the domestic economy was far less extensive than on the Continent , limited by common law and the steadily increasing power of Parliament . Government - controlled monopolies were common , especially before the English Civil War , but were often controversial .
