During the Second Spanish period ( 1784 - 1821 ) of Florida , Spain was dealing with invasions of the Iberian peninsula by Napoleon 's armies in the Peninsular War , and struggled to maintain a tenuous hold on its territories in the western hemisphere as revolution swept South America . The royal administration of Florida was neglected , as the province had long been regarded as an unprofitable backwater by the Crown . The United States , however , considered Florida vital to its political and military interests as it expanded its territory in North America , and maneuvered by sometimes clandestine means to acquire it . The Adams -- On√≠s Treaty , negotiated in 1819 and ratified in 1821 , ceded Florida and St. Augustine , still its capital at the time , to the United States .
