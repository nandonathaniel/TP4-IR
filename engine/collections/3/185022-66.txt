ʻOhana by Hawaiian is a regional subsidiary carrier of Hawaiian Airlines . The service is operated using three ATR 42 turboprop airplanes owned by Hawaiian and operated under contract by Empire Airlines . The new service was slated to begin in summer 2013 initially flying to Moloka'i and Lana'i , however the airline was unable to begin during that period due to Federal Aviation Administration delays in certifying ʻOhana 's operation . ʻOhana by Hawaiian is fully integrated into the Hawaiian Airlines network .
