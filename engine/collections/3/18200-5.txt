By the mid-19th century , there was a strong desire for representative and responsible government in the colonies of Australia , fed by the democratic spirit of the goldfields evident at the Eureka Stockade and the ideas of the great reform movements sweeping Europe , the United States and the British Empire , such as Chartism . The Australian Colonies Government Act , passed in 1850 , was a landmark development that granted representative constitutions to New South Wales , Victoria , South Australia and Tasmania and the colonies enthusiastically set about writing constitutions which produced democratically progressive parliaments -- though the constitutions generally maintained the role of the colonial upper houses as representative of social and economic `` interests '' and all established Constitutional Monarchies with the British monarch as the symbolic head of state . 1855 also saw the granting of the right to vote to all male British subjects 21 years or over in South Australia . This right was extended to Victoria in 1857 and New South Wales the following year . The other colonies followed until , in 1896 , Tasmania became the last colony to grant universal male suffrage .
