The relationship between the informal sectors and poverty certainly is not simple nor does a clear , causal relationship exist . An inverse relationship between an increased informal sector and slower economic growth has been observed though . Average incomes are substantially lower in the informal economy and there is a higher preponderance of impoverished employees working in the informal sector . In addition , workers in the informal economy are less likely to benefit from employment benefits and social protection programs . For instance , a survey in Europe shows that the respondents who have difficulties to pay their household bills have worked informally more often in the past year than those that do not ( 10 % versus 3 % of the respondents ) .
