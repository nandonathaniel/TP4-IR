Wonder Woman ( vol. 1 ) # 105 revealed that Diana was formed from clay by the Queen of the Amazons , given life and power by four of the Greek and Roman gods ( otherwise known as the Olympian deities ) as gifts , corresponding to her renowned epithet : `` Beautiful as Aphrodite , wise as Athena , swifter than Hermes , and stronger than Hercules '' , making her the strongest of the Amazons . Wonder Woman 's Amazon training gave her limited telepathy , profound scientific knowledge , and the ability to speak every language -- even caveman and Martian languages .
