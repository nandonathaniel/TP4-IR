A rand was worth US $ 1.40 from the time of its inception in 1961 until late in 1971 . Its value thereafter fluctuated as various exchange rate dispensations were implemented by the South African authorities . By the early 1980s high inflation and mounting political pressure combined with sanctions placed against the country due to apartheid started to erode its value . The currency broke above parity with the dollar for the first time in March 1982 , and continued to trade between R 1 and R 1.30 to the dollar until June 1984 , when depreciation of the currency gained momentum . By February 1985 , it was trading over R 2 per dollar , and in July that year , all foreign exchange trading was suspended for three days to try to stop the depreciation .
