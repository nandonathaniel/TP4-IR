The psychological war became of critical importance to military and civilian leaders , who waged it in the time - honoured colonial fashion of divide and rule , always trying to `` emphasise that there was in effect a civil war , and that the struggle was not black versus white '' , attempting to isolate Mau Mau from the Kikuyu , and the Kikuyu from the rest of the colony 's population and the world outside . In driving a wedge between Mau Mau and the Kikuyu generally , these propaganda efforts essentially played no role , though they could apparently claim an important contribution to the isolation of Mau Mau from the non-Kikuyu sections of the population .
