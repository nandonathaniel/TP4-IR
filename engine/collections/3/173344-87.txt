The boy was arrested and found to be in possession of cannabis , but a Court of General Sessions Judge suppressed the cannabis because he found that there had been no probable cause for the Secret Service agents to believe the defendant 's words constituted a threat to the President . This did not prevent a federal court from convicting him for threatening the President . The United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit affirmed his conviction , but the Supreme Court reversed , stating , `` We agree with petitioner that his only offense here was ' a kind of very crude offensive method of stating a political opposition to the President . ' Taken in context , and regarding the expressly conditional nature of the statement and the reaction of the listeners , we do not see how it could be interpreted otherwise . '' In a concurring opinion , William O. Douglas noted , `` The Alien and Sedition Laws constituted one of our sorriest chapters ; and I had thought we had done with them forever ... Suppression of speech as an effective police measure is an old , old device , outlawed by our Constitution . ''
