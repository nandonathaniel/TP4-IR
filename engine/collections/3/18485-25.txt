The parasite can be easily grown in monolayers of mammalian cells maintained in vitro in tissue culture.It readily invades and multiplies in a wide variety of fibroblast and monocyte cell lines . In infected cultures , the parasite rapidly multiplies and thousands of tachyzoites break out of infected cells and enter adjacent cells , destroying the monolayer in due course . New monolayers can then be infected using a drop of this infected culture fluid and the parasite indefinitely maintained without the need of animals .
