Under the terms of the concluding Treaty of Versailles signed in 1919 , the empire reached its greatest extent with the addition of 1,800,000 square miles ( 4,700,000 km ) and 13 million new subjects . The colonies of Germany and the Ottoman Empire were distributed to the Allied powers as League of Nations mandates . Britain gained control of Palestine , Transjordan , Iraq , parts of Cameroon and Togoland , and Tanganyika . The Dominions themselves also acquired mandates of their own : the Union of South Africa gained South West Africa ( modern - day Namibia ) , Australia gained New Guinea , and New Zealand Western Samoa . Nauru was made a combined mandate of Britain and the two Pacific Dominions .
