In Serer religion , the tree of life as a religious concept forms the basis of Serer cosmogony . Trees were the first things created on Earth by the supreme being Roog ( or Koox among the Cangin ) . In the competing versions of the Serer creation myth , the Somb ( Prosopis africana ) and the Saas tree ( acacia albida ) are both viewed as trees of life . However , the prevailing view is that , the Somb was the first tree on Earth and the progenitor of plant life . The Somb was also used in the Serer tumuli and burial chambers , many of which had survived for more than a thousand years . Thus , Somb is not only the Tree of Life in Serer society , but the symbol of immortality .
