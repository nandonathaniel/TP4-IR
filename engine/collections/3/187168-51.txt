When the bedrock has frequent fractures on the surface , glacial erosion rates tend to increase as plucking is the main erosive force on the surface ; when the bedrock has wide gaps between sporadic fractures , however , abrasion tends to be the dominant erosive form and glacial erosion rates become slow .
