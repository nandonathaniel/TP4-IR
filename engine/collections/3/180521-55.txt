'' Roger Ebert gave the film 1.5 stars and stated `` What we basically have here is a license for the filmmakers to do whatever they want to do with the special effects , while the plot , like Wile E. Coyote , keeps running into the wall . '' . He later named it the fifth worst film of 2005 . On their television show Ebert & Roeper gave the film `` Two Thumbs Down '' . Lou Lumerick of the New York Post said `` Parents who let their kids see this stinker should be brought up on abuse charges ; so should the movie ratings board that let this suggestive mess slip by with a PG rating .
