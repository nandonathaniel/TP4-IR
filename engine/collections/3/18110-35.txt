The Binding of Isaac was originally developed by Edmund McMillen and Florian Himsl in 2011 from an internal game jam following the completion of McMillen 's previous game , Super Meat Boy . With Super Meat Boy being successful , McMillen had not concerned himself with making a popular game , and instead wanted to craft a game that melded the top - down dungeon approach of The Legend of Zelda with the roguelike genre , wrapping that in a religious allegory based on his own childhood experiences . They used Adobe Flash as it enabled them to develop the game quickly . McMillen quietly released the game to Steam for personal computers , where it proved to be very popular . Looking to expand the game , McMillen and Himsl discovered limitations on Flash that made expansion difficult . Though they were able to incorporate more content through the Wrath of the Lamb expansion , McMillen had to forego a second planned expansion due to the Flash limitations .
