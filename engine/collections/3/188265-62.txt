At birth , the body of the bone is a mere shell , containing the sockets of the two incisor , the canine , and the two deciduous molar teeth , imperfectly partitioned off from one another . The mandibular canal is of large size and runs near the lower border of the bone ; the mental foramen opens beneath the socket of the first deciduous molar tooth . The angle is obtuse ( 175 Â° ) , and the condyloid portion is nearly in line with the body . The coronoid process is of comparatively large size , and projects above the level of the condyle .
