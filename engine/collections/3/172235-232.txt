Integrated schools , which attempt to ensure a balance in enrolment between pupils of Protestant , Roman Catholic and other faiths ( or none ) , are becoming increasingly popular , although Northern Ireland still has a primarily de facto religiously segregated education system . In the primary school sector , forty schools ( 8.9 % of the total number ) are integrated schools and thirty - two ( 7.2 % of the total number ) are Irish language - medium schools .
