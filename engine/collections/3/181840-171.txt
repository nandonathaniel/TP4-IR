The vocal harmonies was something we wanted to do from the beginning , as we are always keen to do that kind of thing . We wanted to be a group that could do the heaviness of hard rock , but also have harmonies swooping around all over the place . We thought there was some real power and emotion in that combination . The guitar solo was pretty much off the cuff , except I think I had plenty of time to think about that one . I remember playing along with it in the studio for a while when other things were being done . I knew what kind of melody I wanted to play .
