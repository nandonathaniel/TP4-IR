The legality of psychoactive drugs has been controversial through most of recent history ; the Second Opium War and Prohibition are two historical examples of legal controversy surrounding psychoactive drugs . However , in recent years , the most influential document regarding the legality of psychoactive drugs is the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs , an international treaty signed in 1961 as an Act of the United Nations . Signed by 73 nations including the United States , the USSR , India , and the United Kingdom , the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs established Schedules for the legality of each drug and laid out an international agreement to fight addiction to recreational drugs by combatting the sale , trafficking , and use of scheduled drugs . All countries that signed the treaty passed laws to implement these rules within their borders . However , some countries that signed the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs , such as the Netherlands , are more lenient with their enforcement of these laws .
