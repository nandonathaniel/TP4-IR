Tests that use polymerase chain reaction ( PCR , aka nucleic acid amplification ) to identify genes unique to N. gonorrhoeae are recommended for screening and diagnosis of gonorrhea infection . These PCR - based tests require a sample of urine , urethral swabs , or cervical / vaginal swabs . Culture ( growing colonies of bacteria in order to isolate and identify them ) and Gram - stain ( staining of bacterial cell walls to reveal morphology ) can also be used to detect the presence of N. gonorrhoeae in all specimen types except urine .
