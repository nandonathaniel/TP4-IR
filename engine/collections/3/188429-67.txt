The economy had hit bottom in March 1933 and then started to expand . Economic indicators show the economy reached nadir in the first days of March , then began a steady , sharp upward recovery . Thus the Federal Reserve Index of Industrial Production sank to its lowest point of 52.8 in July 1932 ( with 1935 -- 1939 = 100 ) and was practically unchanged at 54.3 in March 1933 . However , by July 1933 it reached 85.5 , a dramatic rebound of 57 % in four months . Recovery was steady and strong until 1937 . Except for employment , the economy by 1937 surpassed the levels of the late 1920s . The Recession of 1937 was a temporary downturn . Private sector employment , especially in manufacturing , recovered to the level of the 1920s , but failed to advance further until the war . The U.S. population was 124,840,471 in 1932 and 128,824,829 in 1937 , an increase of 3,984,468 . The ratio of these numbers , times the number of jobs in 1932 , means there was a need for 938,000 more 1937 jobs to maintain the same employment level .
