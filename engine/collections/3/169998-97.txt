The hysterical coda tacked onto the end of `` Revenge and Finale '' is almost worth the price of the disc , as it no doubt sums up Small 's opinion of the film . It 's sad that the great Michael Small was delegated utter crap like Jaws the Revenge in the late ' 80s -- and even worse that he never found his way back to the material that he deserves .
