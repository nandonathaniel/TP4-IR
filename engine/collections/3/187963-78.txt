Washington and the army were surrounded on Brooklyn Heights with the East River to their backs . As the day went on , the British began to dig trenches , slowly coming closer to the American defenses . By doing this , the British would not have to cross over open ground to assault the American defenses as they did in Boston the year before . Despite this perilous situation , Washington ordered 1,200 more men from Manhattan to Brooklyn on August 28 . The men that came over were two Pennsylvania regiments and Colonel John Glover 's regiment from Marblehead , Massachusetts . In command of the Pennsylvanian troops was Thomas Mifflin who , after arriving , volunteered to inspect the outer defenses and report back to Washington . In these outer defenses , small skirmishes were still taking place . On the afternoon of August 28 , it began to rain and Washington had his cannons bombard the British well into the night .
