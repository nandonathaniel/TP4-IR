An arterial blood gas test ( ABG ) is a blood gas test of blood taken from an artery that measures the amounts of certain gases ( such as oxygen and carbon dioxide ) dissolved in arterial blood . An ABG test usually involves a radial artery puncture using a thin needle and syringe and drawing a small volume of blood , but sometimes the femoral artery in the groin or another site is used . The blood can also be drawn from an arterial catheter . An ABG test measures the blood gas tension values of the arterial partial pressure of oxygen , and the arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide , and the blood 's pH . In addition , the arterial oxygen saturation can be determined . Such information is vital when caring for patients with critical illness or respiratory disease . Therefore , the ABG test is one of the most common tests performed on patients in intensive care units . In other levels of care , pulse oximetry plus transcutaneous carbon dioxide measurement is an alternative method of obtaining similar information less invasively .
