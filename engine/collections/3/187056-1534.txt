1 . A period , traditionally on Wednesday afternoons , when a tailor boarded a sailing warship while the vessel was in port ; the crew was excused from most duties and had light duty mending uniforms and hammocks and darning socks . When the ship was at sea , the crew similarly was excused from most duties on Wednesday afternoons to engage in mending chores . Wednesday afternoons , like Sundays , thus were a more social time which allowed crewmen a rest from their normal duties , similar to a Sunday , and , because the crew used rope yarn for mending , Wednesday afternoon became known as rope yarn Sunday .
