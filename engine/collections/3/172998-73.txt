Holmes 's primary intellectual detection method is abductive reasoning . Holmesian deduction consists primarily of observation - based inferences , such as his study of cigar ashes . `` From a drop of water '' , he writes , `` a logician could infer the possibility of an Atlantic or a Niagara without having seen or heard of one or the other '' .
