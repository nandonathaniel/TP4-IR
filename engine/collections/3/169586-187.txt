India 's 2015 World Cup campaign began with a highly anticipated match against Pakistan at Adelaide . Batting first , India lost Rohit ( 15 from 20 balls , 2 fours ) early , but a century from Kohli ( 107 from 126 balls , 8 fours ) along with half - centuries from Raina ( 74 from 56 balls , 5 fours and 3 sixes ) and Dhawan ( 73 from 76 balls , 7 fours and 1 six ) looked to steer India to a big total . However , excellent death bowling by the Pakistani bowlers , with fast bowler Sohail Khan ( 5 - 55 ) taking a 5 - wicket haul , restricted India to exactly 300 / 7 , with India losing 5 wickets for just 27 runs . Pakistan 's reply , however , had little effect . Barring captain Misbah - ul - Haq , who scored 76 , the Pakistani batting crumbled against the Indian pace attack , with Shami taking 4 / 35 , and crashed to 224 all out . India won the match by 76 runs , their biggest win against Pakistan in the World Cup by margin of runs , and as a result , once again maintained their all - win record over their arch - rivals in the World Cup . India next played South Africa at Melbourne , which was another highly anticipated match , in front of a packed crowd comprising mostly Indian supporters . Once again India batted first . Though India lost Rohit early for a duck , they recovered from the early setback thanks to a brilliant century from Dhawan ( 137 from 146 balls , 16 fours and 2 sixes ) and a classy half - century from Rahane ( 79 from 60 balls , 7 fours and 3 sixes ) . However , the lower middle - order then crumbled due to good death bowling from the South African pace attack , with India losing 5 wickets for just 31 runs to finish their innings at 307 / 7 . In the chase , despite losing the openers Hashim Amla and Quinton de Kock early , South Africa were going steady at 108 / 3 , with Faf du Plessis scoring a half - century . But the Indian bowlers led by Ashwin ( 3 / 41 ) then struck back as the Proteas lost their last 7 wickets for 69 runs to be bowled all out for 177 , India winning by 130 runs . It was the first time that India defeated South Africa in the World Cup , having lost to them in 3 previous Cup encounters in 1992 , 1999 and 2011 and was the heaviest defeat for South Africa in the Cricket World Cup .
