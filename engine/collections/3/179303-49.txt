In `` Sanctuary '' and `` The Law on Trial '' , Sheriff McComb has Gillespie and Tibbs brought up on charges after an escaped prisoner is given sanctuary in a monastery and the two do n't arrest him when he refuses to give himself up . Althea fears that if Virgil is convicted , it will be the end of his career as a cop and will hinder his chances of being an attorney . Judge Simms presides over the case . The jury is not able to reach a verdict , and Gillespie and Tibbs are freed . Ted Marcus represents Gillespie and Tibbs in the trial , and Father DiMarco represents himself at trial . Father DiMarco 's heartfelt summation to the jury contributes to the case being dismissed ( though that is not revealed until the start of Season 6 ) .
