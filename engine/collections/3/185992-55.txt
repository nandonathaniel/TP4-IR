Lead content manager Carsten Myhill stressed away the sentiment that the sequel should have been a spin - off in the same vein as Assassin 's Creed : Brotherhood or Assassin 's Creed : Revelations , given the ostensible similarities with Assassin 's Creed III . He stated `` The whole feeling of the game is completely fresh and new . It will feel very different from Assassin 's Creed III . I think it completely warrants the Assassin 's Creed IV moniker , not only with the new name and setting , but the attitude and the tone of the experience . '' Assassin 's Creed IV is the first main series numbered title to carry a subtitle , a decision which Myhill says was made to clearly distinguish the pirate theme from the rest of the franchise .
