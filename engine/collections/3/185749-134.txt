Anarchists and some libertarians deny the sovereignty of states and governments . Anarchists often argue for a specific individual kind of sovereignty , such as the Anarch as a sovereign individual . Salvador Dal√≠ , for instance , talked of `` anarcho - monarchist '' ( as usual for him , tongue in cheek ) ; Antonin Artaud of Heliogabalus : Or , The Crowned Anarchist ; Max Stirner of The Ego and Its Own ; Georges Bataille and Jacques Derrida of a kind of `` antisovereignty '' . Therefore , anarchists join a classical conception of the individual as sovereign of himself , which forms the basis of political consciousness . The unified consciousness is sovereignty over one 's own body , as Nietzsche demonstrated ( see also Pierre Klossowski 's book on Nietzsche and the Vicious Circle ) . See also sovereignty of the individual and self - ownership .
