A new character appears when former Hogwarts Potions master Horace Slughorn replaces Snape , who assumes the Defence Against the Dark Arts post . Harry suddenly excels in Potions , using an old textbook once belonging to a talented student known only as `` The Half - Blood Prince . '' The book contains many handwritten notes , revisions , and new spells ; Hermione , however , believes Harry 's use of it is cheating . Through private meetings with Dumbledore , Harry learns about Voldemort 's orphaned youth , his rise to power , and how he splintered his soul into Horcruxes to achieve immortality . Two Horcruxes have been destroyed -- the diary and a ring ; and Harry and Dumbledore locate another , although it is a fake . When Death Eaters invade Hogwarts , Snape kills Dumbledore . As Snape escapes , he proclaims that he is the Half - Blood Prince ( being the son of a muggle father and the pure - blood Eileen Prince ) . It now falls upon Harry to find and destroy Voldemort 's remaining Horcruxes and to avenge Dumbledore 's death . In a 2005 interview , Rowling stated that ( after the events in the sixth book ) Harry has , `` taken the view that they are now at war . He does become more battle - hardened . He 's now ready to go out fighting . And he 's after revenge ( against Voldemort and Snape ) . ''
