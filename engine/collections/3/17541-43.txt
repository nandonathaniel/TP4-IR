`` Colored Francie '' made her debut in 1967 , and she is sometimes described as the first African American Barbie doll . However , she was produced using the existing head molds for the white Francie doll and lacked African characteristics other than a dark skin . The first African American doll in the Barbie range is usually regarded as Christie , who made her debut in 1968 . Black Barbie was launched in 1980 but still had Caucasian features . In September 2009 , Mattel introduced the So In Style range , which was intended to create a more realistic depiction of black people than previous dolls .
