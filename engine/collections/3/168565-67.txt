According to Merriam - Webster , a continental breakfast usually includes coffee , jam , fruit , and baked goods such as bread and pastries , items chosen because they are shelf - stable , and can be served in portion sizes that are appropriate for large groups of people . The term originated in Britain in the mid-19th century , first used in 1896 public hygiene book The Sanitarian , in which `` continent '' refers to the countries of mainland Europe , though the idea had been around for a few decades as American hotels endeavored to appeal to the changing tastes of the emerging middle class and European travelers visiting America . The term refers to the type of breakfast found in places such France and the Mediterranean , which is lighter and more delicate than the typical full English breakfast , which tends to consist of a large plate of eggs , bacon , sausage , toast , beans , and roasted mushrooms and tomatoes , and less greasy than American breakfasts featuring eggs , breakfast meats , pancakes , potatoes , and toast . Continental breakfasts are also more cost - effective for the establishments serving them , because they require less staff to prepare them .
