During the bottom of the third inning of Game 5 of the 2015 National League Division Series between the New York Mets and Los Angeles Dodgers , TBS 's cameras caught a tense exchange between Dodgers manager Don Mattingly and outfielder Andre Ethier . So when TBS went to an interview conducted between innings by Sam Ryan in the Dodgers ' dugout with Mattingly , the assumption was that Ryan would ask Mattingly what happened . Ryan then proceeded to ask Mattingly instead , how he thought Zack Greinke was pitching , what he thought of the game so far . Later in the broadcast , Cal Ripken , Jr. brought up what we had all seen when Ethier came up to bat again in the fifth , saying , `` We 're still guessing what that argument was all about . ''
