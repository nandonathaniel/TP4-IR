The Pilot ACE has binary floating - point arithmetic , and it became operational in 1950 at National Physical Laboratory , UK . Thirty - three were later sold commercially as the English Electric DEUCE . The arithmetic is actually implemented in software , but with a one megahertz clock rate , the speed of floating - point and fixed - point operations in this machine were initially faster than those of many competing computers .
