In a GC analysis , a known volume of gaseous or liquid analyte is injected into the `` entrance '' ( head ) of the column , usually using a micro syringe ( or , solid phase microextraction fibers , or a gas source switching system ) . As the carrier gas sweeps the analyte molecules through the column , this motion is inhibited by the adsorption of the analyte molecules either onto the column walls or onto packing materials in the column . The rate at which the molecules progress along the column depends on the strength of adsorption , which in turn depends on the type of molecule and on the stationary phase materials . Since each type of molecule has a different rate of progression , the various components of the analyte mixture are separated as they progress along the column and reach the end of the column at different times ( retention time ) . A detector is used to monitor the outlet stream from the column ; thus , the time at which each component reaches the outlet and the amount of that component can be determined . Generally , substances are identified ( qualitatively ) by the order in which they emerge ( elute ) from the column and by the retention time of the analyte in the column .
