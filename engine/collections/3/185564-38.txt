From China , the plague spread to the Indian subcontinent around 1896 . Over the next thirty years , India would lose 12.5 million people to the bubonic plague . The disease was initially seen in port cities , beginning with Bombay ( now Mumbai ) , but later emerged in Poona ( now Pune ) , Kolkata , and Karachi ( now in Pakistan ) . By 1899 , the outbreak spread to smaller communities and rural areas in many regions of India . Overall , the impact of plague epidemics was greatest in western and northern India -- in the provinces then designated as Bombay , Punjab , and the United Provinces -- while eastern and southern India were not as badly affected . Ultimately , more than 12 million people died from the plague in India ( including present day Pakistan and Bangladesh ) and China alone .
