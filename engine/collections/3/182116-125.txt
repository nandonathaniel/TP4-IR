In the 1870s , Julius Vogel was periodically both colonial treasurer and premier . He viewed New Zealand as a `` Britain of the South Seas '' and began the development of infrastructure in New Zealand investing in heavily in roads , railways , telegraphs and bridges funded by public borrowing . Progress slowed after the collapse of the City of Glasgow Bank in 1878 which led to a contraction in credit from London , the centre of the world 's financial system at the time . Economic activity was depressed for some years afterwards , until refrigeration was introduced in 1882 . This enabled New Zealand to start exporting meat and other frozen products to the United Kingdom . Refrigeration transformed and shaped the development of the economy but , in the process , established New Zealand 's economic dependence on Britain .
