Unlike most TV series that film their episodes in order , Slasher , under the direction of Craig David Wallace , was shot as if it were a `` super-sized '' movie : Scenes from multiple episodes were shot at the same time , with the availability of locations and cast being factored in . The out - of - order schedule allowed the actors to know of their characters ' fates , especially those who had to film their death scenes one day but return later to film earlier scenes as necessary . As an example of this , Martin cited Mark Ghanim√© 's first day on set , when his character , Justin Faysal , was laid out in a casket for a scene early in Slasher 's third episode ( Justin 's death , which took place in Episode 2 , would be filmed later on ) .
