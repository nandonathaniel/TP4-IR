Years later , the superhero team the Avengers discovers Steve Rogers ' body in the North Atlantic . After he revives , they piece together that Rogers has been preserved in a block of ice since 1945 , surviving because of his enhancements from Project : Rebirth . The block began to melt after the Sub-Mariner , enraged that an Inuit tribe is worshipping the frozen figure , throws it into the ocean . Rogers accepts membership in the Avengers , and his experience in individual combat service and his time with the Invaders makes him a valuable asset . He quickly assumes leadership and has typically returned to that position throughout the team 's history .
