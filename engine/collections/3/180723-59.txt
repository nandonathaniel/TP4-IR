In physical cosmology , volumes of cubic gigaparsecs ( Gpc ) are selected to determine the distribution of matter in the visible universe and to determine the number of galaxies and quasars . The Sun is the only star in its cubic parsec , ( pc ) but in globular clusters the stellar density could be from 100 to 1000 per cubic parsec .
