On 15 February 2016 , with a change in routing , the first train dispatched under the OBOR scheme arrived from eastern Zhejiang Province to Tehran . Though this section does not complete the Silk Road -- style overland connection between China and Europe , plans are underway to extend the route past Tehran , through Istanbul , into Europe . The actual route went through Almaty , Bishkek , Samarkand , and Dushanbe .
