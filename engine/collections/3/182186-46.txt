Many of Mercier 's errors were again corrected in a from - the - ground - up re-examination of the sources and an entirely new translation by Walter James Miller and Frederick Paul Walter , published in 1993 by Naval Institute Press in a `` completely restored and annotated edition '' . It was based on Walter 's own 1991 public - domain translation , which is available from a number of sources , notably a recent edition with the title Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Seas ( ISBN 978 - 1 - 904808 - 28 - 2 ) . In 2010 Walter released a fully revised , newly researched translation with the title 20,000 Leagues Under the Seas -- part of an omnibus of five of his Verne translations titled Amazing Journeys : Five Visionary Classics and published by State University of New York Press .
