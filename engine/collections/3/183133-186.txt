Islam has restrictions on food , such as how the meat is prepared . Halal meat is prepared by ritual slaughter that involves cutting the jugular veins of the animal with a sharp knife . This leads to death via bleeding . Meat from animals that die of natural causes or accident is not allowed . Beef is a sought after meat among Muslims , but they strictly avoid pork and alcohol .
