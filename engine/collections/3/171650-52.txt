The 2014 -- 15 season saw the premieres of three critically acclaimed shows that also earned strong ratings : Arrow spin - off The Flash , the freshman comedy - drama Jane the Virgin ( loosely adapted from the Venezuelan telenovela Juana la Virgen ) , and freshman offbeat crime dramedy iZombie ( a loose adaptation based on DC 's Vertigo comic book series of the same name ) . The Flash surpassed The Vampire Dairies as the highest - rated premiere in the network 's history and became the most watched show on the network . Jane the Virgin , meanwhile , earned some of the highest critical praise of any series during the 2014 -- 15 television season , and during its first season , became the first CW series ever to have been nominated for and win a Golden Globe Award ( with lead actress Gina Rodriguez winning the Golden Globe for `` Best Actress in a Comedy or Variety Series '' ) . iZombie , which premiered as a mid-season replacement , earned both strong ratings ( at one point becoming the third highest - rated show on The CW ) and critical acclaim . Overall , the network ended the 2014 -- 15 season posting its highest average total viewership in a single television season since 2007 -- 08 with 2.15 million viewers , a 12 % increase in total viewership year - to - year ; The CW also posted its highest seasonal demographic ratings among males ages 18 -- 49 with a 0.8 share .
