During its first 18 months of rule , the PDPA applied a Soviet - style program of modernizing reforms , many of which were viewed by conservatives as opposing Islam . Decrees setting forth changes in marriage customs and land reform were not received well by a population deeply immersed in tradition and Islam , particularly by the powerful landowners who were harmed economically by the abolition of usury ( although usury is prohibited in Islam ) and the cancellation of farmers ' debts . The new government also enhanced women 's rights , sought a rapid eradication of illiteracy and promoted Afghanistan 's ethnic minorities , although these programs appear to have had an effect only in the urban areas . By mid-1978 , a rebellion started , with rebels attacking the local military garrison in the Nuristan region of eastern Afghanistan and soon civil war spread throughout the country . In September 1979 , Deputy Prime Minister Hafizullah Amin seized power , arresting and killing President Taraki . Over two months of instability overwhelmed Amin 's regime as he moved against his opponents in the PDPA and the growing rebellion .
