The early hypothesis of belief disconfirmation presented in When Prophecy Fails ( 1956 ) reported that faith deepened among the members of an apocalyptic religious cult , despite the failed prophecy of an alien spacecraft soon to land on Earth , to rescue them from earthly corruption . At the determined place and time , the cult assembled ; they believed that only they would survive planetary destruction ; yet the spaceship did not arrive to Earth . The disconfirmed prophecy caused them acute cognitive - dissonance : Had they been victims of a hoax ? Had they vainly donated away their material possessions ? To resolve the dissonance , between apocalyptic , end - of - the - world religious beliefs and earthly , material reality , most of the cult restored their psychological consonance by choosing to hold a less mentally - stressful idea to explain the missed landing . That the aliens had given planet Earth a second chance at existence , which , in turn , empowered them to re-direct their religious cult to environmentalism ; social advocacy to end human damage to planet Earth . Moreover , upon overcoming the disconfirmed belief by changing to global environmentalism , the cult increased in numbers , by successful proselytism .
