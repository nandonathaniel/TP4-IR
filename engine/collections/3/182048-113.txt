The New York Times stated in an editorial , `` The Supreme Court has handed lobbyists a new weapon . A lobbyist can now tell any elected official : if you vote wrong , my company , labor union or interest group will spend unlimited sums explicitly advertising against your re-election . '' Jonathan Alter called it the `` most serious threat to American democracy in a generation '' . The Christian Science Monitor wrote that the Court had declared `` outright that corporate expenditures can not corrupt elected officials , that influence over lawmakers is not corruption , and that appearance of influence will not undermine public faith in our democracy '' .
