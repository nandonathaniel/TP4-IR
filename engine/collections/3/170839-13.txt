During surveys carried out between 1997 and 2001 , a spot was found along the Mariana Trench that had depth similar to that of the Challenger Deep , possibly even deeper . It was discovered while scientists from the Hawaii Institute of Geophysics and Planetology were completing a survey around Guam ; they used a sonar mapping system towed behind the research ship to conduct the survey . This new spot was named the HMRG ( Hawaii Mapping Research Group ) Deep , after the group of scientists who discovered it .
