In 2012 , the National Institutes of Health -- AARP Diet and Health Study analysed the relationship between coffee drinking and mortality . They found that higher coffee consumption was associated with lower risk of death , and that those who drank any coffee lived longer than those who did not . However the authors noted , `` whether this was a causal or associational finding can not be determined from our data . '' A 2014 meta - analysis found that coffee consumption ( 4 cups / day ) was inversely associated with all - cause mortality ( a 16 % lower risk ) , as well as cardiovascular disease mortality specifically ( a 21 % lower risk from drinking 3 cups / day ) , but not with cancer mortality . Additional meta - analysis studies corroborated these findings , showing that higher coffee consumption ( 2 -- 4 cups per day ) was associated with a reduced risk of death by all disease causes .
