Naviti won the challenge , and also received a flint reward , as Malolo already had flint after winning the first reward challenge . For winning the immunity challenge , Naviti had to send one person from Malolo to Ghost Island , where they would be immune from the vote ; Naviti sent Jacob after he declared Malolo was the best tribe in Survivor history . On Ghost Island , Jacob had to break an urn to play a game for an advantage ; if he lost , he would have to forfeit his vote at the next Tribal Council . He subsequently won a game of chance which gave him Sierra 's legacy advantage from Game Changers . He had to will it to someone from Naviti , and he chose Morgan . He also made a fake idol . At Malolo , the tribe had to come up with a new plan , as Jacob was their intended target . Gonzalez rallied votes against Donathan for being the tribe 's weakest link , but at Tribal Council , her paranoia got the better of her as she whispered to her tribemates , asking who they were targeting that night . Although everyone told her they were targeting Donathan , it was revealed that they had lied to her , and Gonzalez was unanimously blindsided , becoming the first person voted out .
