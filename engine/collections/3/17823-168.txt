As the ghostly butler Grady ( Philip Stone ) tells him during their chilling confrontation in the men 's toilet , ' You 're the caretaker , sir . You 've always been the caretaker . ' Perhaps in some earlier incarnation Jack really was around in 1921 , and it 's his present - day self that is the shadow , the phantom photographic copy . But if his picture has been there all along , why has no one noticed it ? After all , it 's right at the center of the central picture on the wall , and the Torrances have had a painfully drawn - out winter of mind - numbing leisure in which to inspect every corner of the place . Is it just that , like Poe 's purloined letter , the thing in plain sight is the last thing you see ? When you do see it , the effect is so unsettling because you realise the unthinkable was there under your nose -- overlooked -- the whole time .
