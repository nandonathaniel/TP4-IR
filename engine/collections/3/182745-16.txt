`` Unlike their counterparts in the United States , most Arts and Crafts practitioners in Britain had strong , slightly incoherent , negative feelings about machinery . They thought of ' the craftsman ' as free , creative , and working with his hands , ' the machine ' as soulless , repetitive , and inhuman . These contrasting images derive in part from John Ruskin 's ( 1819 - 1900 ) The Stones of Venice , an architectural history of Venice that contains a powerful denunciation of modern industrialism to which Arts and Crafts designers returned again and again . Distrust for the machine lay behind the many little workshops that turned their backs on the industrial world around 1900 , using preindustrial techniques to create what they called ' crafts .
