1832 Congress enacts a new protective tariff , the Tariff of 1832 , which offers South Carolina and the South little relief and provokes new controversy between the sections of the country . John C. Calhoun further explains the nullification doctrine in an open letter to South Carolina Governor James Hamilton , Jr. Calhoun says that the Constitution only raised the federal government to the level of the state , not above it . He argues that nullification is not secession and did not require secession to be put into effect . Thomas R. Dew writes Review of the Debate in the Virginia Legislature of 1831 and 1832 , a strong defense of slavery and attack on colonization in Africa by freed slaves . On November 19 , 1832 , South Carolina calls a state convention , which passes an Ordinance of Nullification with an effective date of February 1 , 1833 . The convention declares the tariff void because it threatens the state 's essential interests . The South Carolina legislature acts to enforce the ordinance . President Andrew Jackson , a Southerner and slave owner , calls nullification `` rebellious treason '' and threatens to use force against possible secessionist action in South Carolina caused by the Nullification Crisis . Congress passes the `` Force Bill '' which permits the President to use the Army and Navy to enforce the law . Jackson also urges Congress to modify the tariff , which they soon do .
