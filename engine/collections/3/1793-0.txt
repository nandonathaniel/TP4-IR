Keep Calm and Carry On was a motivational poster produced by the British government in 1939 in preparation for World War II . The poster was intended to raise the morale of the British public , threatened with widely predicted mass air attacks on major cities . Although 2.45 million copies were printed , and although the Blitz did in fact take place , the poster was hardly ever publicly displayed and was little known until a copy was rediscovered in 2000 at Barter Books , a bookshop in Alnwick . It has since been re-issued by a number of private companies , and has been used as the decorative theme for a range of products .
