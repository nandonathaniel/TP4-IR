After an ineffective attack by L 10 on Tyneside on 15 -- 16 June the short summer nights discouraged further raids for some months , and the remaining Army Zeppelins were reassigned to the Eastern and Balkan fronts . The Navy resumed raids on Britain in August , when three largely ineffective raids were carried out . On 10 August the antiaircraft guns had their first success , causing L 12 to come down into the sea off Zeebrugge , and on 17 -- 18 August L 10 became the first Navy airship to reach London . Mistaking the reservoirs of the Lea Valley for the Thames , it dropped its bombs on Walthamstow and Leytonstone . L 10 was destroyed a little over two weeks later : it was struck by lightning and caught fire off Cuxhaven , and the entire crew was killed . Three Army airships set off to bomb London on 7 -- 8 September , of which two succeeded : SL 2 dropped bombs between Southwark and Woolwich : LZ 74 scattered 39 bombs over Cheshunt before heading on to London and dropping a single bomb on Fenchurch Street station .
