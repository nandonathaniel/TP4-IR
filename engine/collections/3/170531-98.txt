So - called Limburg pottery and La Hoguette pottery are styles which stretch into northwestern France and the Netherlands , but it has sometimes been argued that these technologies are the result of pottery technology spreading beyond the original LBK farming population of eastern Belgium and northeastern France , and being made by hunter gatherers . A slightly later - starting Neolithic culture found in central Wallonia is the so - called `` Groupe de Blicquy '' , which may represent an offshoot of the LBK settlers . One notable archaeological site in this region is the Neolithic flint mines of Spiennes .
