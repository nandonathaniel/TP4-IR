During training camp in the summer months , held outside the Don Hutson Center , young Packers fans can bring their bikes and have their favorite players ride them from the locker room to practice at Ray Nitschke Field . This old tradition began around the time of Lambeau Field 's construction in 1957 . Gary Knafelc , a Packers end at the time , said , `` I think it was just that kids wanted us to ride their bikes . I can remember kids saying , ' Hey , ride my bike . ' '' Each new generation of Packer fan delights at the opportunity .
