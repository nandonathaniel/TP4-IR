The world of fashion and scepticism that emerged encouraged the art of satire . All the major poets of the period , Samuel Butler , John Dryden , Alexander Pope and Samuel Johnson , and the Irish poet Jonathan Swift , wrote satirical verse. Their satire was often written in defence of public order and the established church and government . However , writers such as Pope used their gift for satire to create scathing works responding to their detractors or to criticise what they saw as social atrocities perpetrated by the government . Pope 's `` The Dunciad '' is a satirical slaying of two of his literary adversaries ( Lewis Theobald , and Colley Cibber in a later version ) , expressing the view that British society was falling apart morally , culturally , and intellectually .
