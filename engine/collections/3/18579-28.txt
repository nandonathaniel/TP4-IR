A complete new set of stamps was issued in 1882 for the Empire of India that had been proclaimed five years earlier , in 1877 . The designs consisted of the usual Victoria profile , in a variety of frames , inscribed `` INDIA POSTAGE '' . The watermark also changed to a star shape . These stamps were heavily used and are still quite common today .
