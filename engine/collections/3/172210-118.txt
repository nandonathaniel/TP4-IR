African Americans continued to press in the 1950s and 1960s to end disenfranchisement and segregation in the state through the civil rights movement , including legal challenges . In 1954 , the US Supreme Court ruled in Brown v. Board of Education that public schools had to be desegregated , but Alabama was slow to comply . During the 1960s , under Governor George Wallace , Alabama resisted compliance with federal demands for desegregation . The civil rights movement had notable events in Alabama , including the Montgomery Bus Boycott ( 1955 -- 56 ) , Freedom Rides in 1961 , and 1965 Selma to Montgomery marches . These contributed to Congressional passage and enactment of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Voting Rights Act of 1965 by the U.S. Congress .
