In biological taxonomy , a domain ( Latin : regio ) , also superkingdom or empire , is the highest taxonomic rank of organisms in the three - domain system of taxonomy designed by Carl Woese , an American microbiologist and biophysicist . According to the Woese system , introduced in 1990 , the tree of life consists of three domains : Archaea , Bacteria , and Eukarya . The first two are all prokaryotic microorganisms , or single - celled organisms whose cells have no nucleus . All life that has a nucleus and membrane - bound organelles , and multicellular organisms , is included in the Eukarya . Stefan Luketa in 2012 proposed a five `` dominion '' system , adding two more to the above .
