Tom Doherty enjoyed The Eye of the World so much that he declared it would be the biggest fantasy series since Tolkien , and took the unprecedented steps of sending free review copies to every bookstore in the United States to generate interest . The combined hardcover and trade paperback run of the novel sold out of its initial 40,000 - strong print run . Sales then doubled with the publication of the second novel just eight months later generating more interest in the first book .
