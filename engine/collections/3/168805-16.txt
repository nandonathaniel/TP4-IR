The bust of Nefertiti is 48 centimetres ( 19 in ) tall and weighs about 20 kilograms ( 44 lb ) . It is made of a limestone core covered with painted stucco layers . The face is completely symmetrical and almost intact , but the left eye lacks the inlay present in the right . The pupil of the right eye is of inserted quartz with black paint and is fixed with beeswax . The background of the eye - socket is unadorned limestone . Nefertiti wears her characteristic blue crown known as the `` Nefertiti cap crown '' with a golden diadem band looped around like horizontal ribbons and joining at the back , and an Uraeus ( cobra ) over her brow -- which is now broken . She also wears a broad collar with a floral pattern on it . The ears also have suffered some damage . Gardner 's Art Through the Ages suggests that `` With this elegant bust , Thutmose may have been alluding to a heavy flower on its slender sleek stalk by exaggerating the weight of the crowned head and the length of the almost serpentine neck .
