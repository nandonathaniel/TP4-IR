By 2011 , shortly before the release of On Stranger Tides , Terry Rossio was writing a script for a fifth film without his partner Ted Elliott . Rossio 's draft was ultimately rejected . `` My version of Dead Men Tell No Tales was set aside because it featured a female villain , '' recalled Rossio , `` and Johnny Depp was worried that would be redundant to Dark Shadows , which also featured a female villain . '' In January 2013 , Disney hired Jeff Nathanson to work on a script . That September , producer Bruckheimer said , `` We have an outline everyone loves but the script is not done , '' explaining that the release would be postponed beyond summer 2015 .
