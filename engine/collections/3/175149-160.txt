Jack Valenti , former president of the MPAA , later said he regretted not giving the film an NC - 17 rating . In response to the film 's controversy , the MPAA began backing up their ratings on print posters by posting reasons to explain them , beginning in 2000 . The film 's use of profanity gained it a Guinness World Record in their 2001 edition for `` Most Swearing in an Animated Film '' ( 399 profane words , including 146 uses of `` fuck '' ; 128 offensive gestures ; and 221 acts of violence -- in effect , one every six seconds ) .
