State law codifies Oklahoma 's state emblems and honorary positions ; the Oklahoma Senate or House of Representatives may adopt resolutions designating others for special events and to benefit organizations . Currently the State Senate is waiting to vote on a change to the state 's motto . The House passed HCR 1024 , which will change the state motto from `` Labor Omnia Vincit '' to `` Oklahoma - In God We Trust ! '' The author of the resolution stated a constituent researched the Oklahoma Constitution and found no `` official '' vote regarding `` Labor Omnia Vincit '' , therefore opening the door for an entirely new motto .
