Traditionally , scholars favored deriving the name `` Eden '' from the Akkadian edinnu , derived from a Sumerian word edin meaning `` plain '' or `` steppe '' . Eden is now believed to be more closely related to an Aramaic root word meaning `` fruitful , well - watered . '' Another interpretation associates the name `` Eden '' with a Hebrew word for `` pleasure '' ; thus the Douay - Rheims Bible in Genesis 2 : 8 has the wording `` And the Lord God had planted a paradise of pleasure '' ( rather than `` a garden in Eden '' ) . The Hebrew term is translated `` pleasure '' in Sarah 's secret saying in Genesis 18 : 12 .
