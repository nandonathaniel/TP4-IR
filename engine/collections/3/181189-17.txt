The Dolce Campana pedal pianoforte c. 1850 , built by Boardman and Gray , New York , demonstrated yet another creative way of modifying the piano 's sound . A pedal controlled a series of hammers or weights attached to the soundboard that would fall onto an equal number of screws , and created the sound of bells or the harp . The Fazioli concert grand piano model F308 includes a fourth pedal to the left of the traditional three pedals . This pedal acts similarly to the `` half - blow '' pedal on an upright piano , in that it collectively moves the hammers somewhat closer to the strings to reduce the volume without changing the tone quality , as the una - corda does . The F308 is the first modern concert grand to offer such a feature .
