Large amounts of heat are wasted if a boiler is not insulated . Early locomotives used shaped wooden battens fitted lengthways along the boiler barrel , and held in place by metal bands . Improved insulating methods included applying a thick paste containing a porous mineral such as kieselgur , or attaching shaped blocks of insulating compound such as magnesia blocks . In the latter days of steam , `` mattresses '' of stitched asbestos cloth stuffed with asbestos fibre were fixed to the boiler , on separators so as not quite to touch the boiler . However , asbestos is currently banned in most countries for health reasons . The most common modern day material is glass wool , or wrappings of aluminium foil .
