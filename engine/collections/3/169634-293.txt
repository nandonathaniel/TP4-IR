Sharma and Bharadwaj started the show with a traditional Ghoomar dance performance from the famous movie Padmaavat . The judges appreciated their performance and mentioned that it looked like two Deepika Padukone are dancing on the stage . This dance form is very difficult to perform with a pot on the head , and brass plates in hand . The mixed another dance form using elastics giving the feel of dolls dancing with strings ( Kathputli ) . It had some moves of robotics . Both scored a perfect five . Even when Sharma 's plate fell off , she still maintained her composure .
