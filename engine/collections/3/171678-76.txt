Modeled on the Montgomery Bus Boycott , protest actions in Birmingham began in 1962 , when students from local colleges arranged for a year of staggered boycotts . They caused downtown business to decline by as much as 40 percent , which attracted attention from Chamber of Commerce president Sidney Smyer , who commented that the `` racial incidents have given us a black eye that we 'll be a long time trying to forget '' . In response to the boycott , the City Commission of Birmingham punished the black community by withdrawing $45,000 ( $360,000 in 2018 ) from a surplus - food program used primarily by low - income blacks . The result , however , was a black community more motivated to resist .
