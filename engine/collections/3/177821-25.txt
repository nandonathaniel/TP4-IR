Other than voluntary retirement , statute sets a number of mandates for retirement . All brigadier generals must retire after five years in grade or 30 years of service , whichever is later , unless selected or appointed for promotion , or reappointed to grade to serve longer . Otherwise all general and flag officers must retire the month after their 64th birthday . However , the Secretary of Defense can defer a general or flag officer 's retirement until the officer 's 66th birthday and the President can defer it until the officer 's 68th birthday . Because there are a finite number of General officer positions , one officer must retire before another can be promoted . As a result , General and flag officers typically retire well in advance of the statutory age and service limits , so as not to impede the upward career mobility of their juniors .
