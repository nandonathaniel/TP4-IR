A series of stylized dancing bears was drawn by Bob Thomas as part of the back cover for the album History of the Grateful Dead , Volume One ( Bear 's Choice ) ( 1973 ) . Thomas reported that he based the bears on a lead sort from an unknown font . The bear is a reference to Owsley `` Bear '' Stanley , who recorded and produced the album . Bear himself wrote , `` the bears on the album cover are not really ' dancing ' . I do n't know why people think they are ; their positions are quite obviously those of a high - stepping march . ''
