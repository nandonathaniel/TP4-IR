The official Portuguese name of the land , in original Portuguese records , was the `` Land of the Holy Cross '' ( Terra da Santa Cruz ) , but European sailors and merchants commonly called it simply the `` Land of Brazil '' ( Terra do Brasil ) because of the brazilwood trade . The popular appellation eclipsed and eventually supplanted the official Portuguese name . Some early sailors called it the `` Land of Parrots '' .
