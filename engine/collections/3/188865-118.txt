Aggie football fans are called the 12th Man , meaning that they support the 11 players on the field and would be willing , if it were possible , to enter the game if necessary . To further symbolize their `` readiness , desire , and enthusiasm , '' it is traditional for students in attendance to stand throughout the game . The tradition began on January 2 , 1922 , at the Dixie Classic where A&M played Centre College . A&M had so many injuries in the first half of the game that Coach Dana X . Bible feared he would not have enough men to finish the game . He called into the stands for E. King Gill , a reserve who had left football after the regular season to play basketball . Although he did not actually play , his readiness symbolized the willingness of all Aggies to support their team to the point of actually entering the game . A&M won 22 -- 14 , but E. King Gill was the only man left standing on the sidelines for the Aggies . In recent decades , the 12th Man is represented on the field by a walk - on player who wears the No. 12 jersey and participates in kick - offs .
