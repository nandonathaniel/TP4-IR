The government fiscal balance is one of three major sectoral balances in the national economy , the others being the foreign sector and the private sector . The sum of the surpluses or deficits across these three sectors must be zero by definition . For example , if there is a foreign financial surplus ( or capital surplus ) because capital is imported ( net ) to fund the trade deficit , and there is also a private sector financial surplus due to household savings exceeding business investment , then by definition , there must exist a government budget deficit so all three net to zero . The government sector includes federal , state and local governments . For example , the U.S. government budget deficit in 2011 was approximately 10 % GDP ( 8.6 % GDP of which was federal ) , offsetting a capital surplus of 4 % GDP and a private sector surplus of 6 % GDP .
