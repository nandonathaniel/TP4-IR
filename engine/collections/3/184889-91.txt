Similarly , the water quality in the Long Beach portion of San Pedro Bay , which is enclosed by the Federal Breakwater , commonly ranks among the poorest on the entire West Coast during rainy periods . Many Long Beach beaches average a D or F grade on beach water quality during wet periods in the Beach Report Card published by Heal the Bay . However , during dry periods the water often attains A ratings in the same reports . The Los Angeles River discharges directly into the Long Beach side of San Pedro Bay and conveys a large portion of all the urban runoff from the entire Los Angeles metropolitan area directly into the harbor water . This runoff contains most of the debris , garbage , chemical pollutants , and biological pathogens that are washed into storm drains in every upstream city each time it rains . Because the breakwater prevents normal tidal flushing and wave action , these pollutants build up in the harbor . The water enclosed by the breakwater , along most of the city 's beaches , can be subject to red tides due to this stagnation as well . Because of these factors , the water in Long Beach is unsafe for swimming on a few days or weeks each year .
