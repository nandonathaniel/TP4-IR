The largest area inhabited by Swedes , as well as the earliest known original area inhabited by their linguistic ancestors , is in the country of Sweden , situated on the eastern side of the Scandinavian Peninsula and the islands adjacent to it , situated west of the Baltic Sea in northern Europe . The Swedish - speaking people living in near - coastal areas on the north - eastern and eastern side of the Baltic Sea also have a long history of continuous settlement , which in some of these areas possibly started about a millennium ago . These people include the Swedish - speakers in mainland Finland -- speaking Swedish dialect commonly referred as Finland Swedish ( finlandssvenska which is part of East - Swedish dialect group ) and the almost exclusively Swedish - speaking population of the Ã…land Islands speaking in a manner closer to the adjacent dialects in Sweden than to adjacent dialects of Finland Swedish . Estonia also had an important Swedish minority which persisted for about 650 years on the coast and isles . Smaller groups of historical descendants of 18th -- 20th - century Swedish emigrants who still retain varying aspects of Swedish identity to this day can be found in the Americas ( especially Minnesota and Wisconsin , see Swedish Americans ) and in Ukraine .
