Catholic ( from Greek : καθολικός , translit . katholikos , lit . ' universal ' ) was first used to describe the church in the early 2nd century . The first known use of the phrase `` the catholic church '' ( καθολικὴ ἐκκλησία he katholike ekklesia ) occurred in the letter written about 110 AD from Saint Ignatius of Antioch to the Smyrnaeans . In the Catechetical Lectures ( c. 350 ) of Saint Cyril of Jerusalem , the name `` Catholic Church '' was used to distinguish it from other groups that also called themselves `` the church '' . The `` Catholic '' notion was further stressed in the edict De fide Catolica issued 380 by Theodosius I , the last emperor to rule over both the eastern and the western halves of the Roman Empire , when establishing the state church of the Roman Empire .
