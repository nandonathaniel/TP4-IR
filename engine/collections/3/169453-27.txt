There are three types of tears : basal tears , reflexive tears , and psychic tears . Basal tears are produced at a rate of about 1 to 2 microliters a minute , and are made in order to keep the eye lubricated and smooth out irregularities in the cornea . Reflexive tears are tears that are made in response to irritants to the eye , such as when chopping onions or getting poked in the eye . Psychic tears are produced by the lacrimal system and are the tears expelled during emotional states .
