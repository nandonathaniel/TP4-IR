Statewide smoking ban excluding bars , casinos , and designated restaurant smoking rooms : On December 8 , 2006 , after passage by 54 % of voters on November 7 , 2006 , the Nevada Clean Indoor Air Act went into effect , banning smoking statewide in all enclosed workplaces . The act passed by voters initially included all restaurants as well as bars that serve food . The Act permits smoking without limitation in areas within casinos where minors are already prohibited , stand - alone bars that do not serve food , strip clubs and brothels , retail tobacco stores , and private residences ( including those that serve as an office workplace , unless used as a childcare , adult daycare , or healthcare facility ) . Local governments may regulate smoking more stringently than the Act , though no city or county in Nevada has chosen to do so . In 2009 Nevada partially repealed the ban to allow smoking in tobacco - related trade conventions . The ban was further amended in 2011 to allow smoking in taverns that serve alcohol and food as long as patrons under 21 are not allowed in . Smoking is also now allowed in designated areas of family restaurants if the smoking area is physically enclosed and separated from the non-smoking area and minors are prohibited inside .
