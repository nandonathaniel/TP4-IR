In 1856 -- 57 , Karl August von Steinheil and LÃ©on Foucault introduced a process of depositing a layer of silver on glass telescope mirrors . The silver layer was not only much more reflective and longer lasting than the finish on speculum mirrors , it had the advantage of being able to be removed and re-deposited without changing the shape of the glass substrate . Towards the end of the 19th century very large silver on glass mirror reflecting telescopes were built .
