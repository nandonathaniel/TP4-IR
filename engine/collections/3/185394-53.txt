Many familiar voices inspired the animators in their creation of the characters and helped them shape their personalities . This use of familiar voices for key characters was a rarity in Disney 's past films . The staff was shocked to hear that a wise cracking comedian , Phil Harris was going to be in a Kipling film . Disney suggested Harris after meeting him at a party . Harris improvised most of his lines , as he considered the scripted lines `` did n't feel natural '' . After Harris was cast , Disneyland Records president Jimmy Johnson suggested Disney to get Louis Prima as King Louie , as he `` felt that Louis would be great as foil '' . Walt also cast other prominent actors such as George Sanders as Shere Khan and Sebastian Cabot as Bagheera . Additionally , he cast regular Disney voices such as Sterling Holloway as Kaa , J. Pat O'Malley as Colonel Hathi and Buzzie the Vulture and Verna Felton as Hathi 's wife . This was her last film before she died . David Bailey was originally cast as Mowgli , but his voice changed during production , leading Bailey to not fit the `` young innocence of Mowgli 's character '' at which the producers were aiming . Thus director Wolfgang Reitherman cast his son Bruce , who had just voiced Christopher Robin in Winnie the Pooh and the Honey Tree . The animators shot footage of Bruce as a guide for the character 's performance . Child actress Darlene Carr was going around singing in the studio when composers Sherman Brothers asked her to record a demo of `` My Own Home '' . Carr 's performance impressed Disney enough for him to cast her as the role of the human girl .
