Seven unpublished drawings for the book were also displayed at the museum 's exhibit , including fearsome looking baobab trees ready to destroy the prince 's home asteroid , as well as a picture of the story 's narrator , the forlorn pilot , sleeping next to his aircraft . That image was likely omitted to avoid giving the story a ' literalness ' that would distract its readers , according to one of the Morgan Library 's staff . According to Christine Nelson , curator of literary and historical manuscripts at the Morgan , `` ( t ) he image evokes Saint - Exupéry 's own experience of awakening in an isolated , mysterious place . You can almost imagine him wandering without much food and water and conjuring up the character of the Little Prince . '' Another reviewer noted that the author `` chose the best illustrations ... to maintain the ethereal tone he wanted his story to exude . Choosing between ambiguity and literal text and illustrations , Saint - Exupéry chose in every case to obfuscate . '' Not a single drawing of the story 's narrator -- pilot survived the author 's editing process ; `` he was very good at excising what was not essential to his story '' .
