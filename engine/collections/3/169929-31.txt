Charles then attempted to seize the port of Kingston - upon - Hull where arms and equipment previously collected for the Bishops ' Wars had been gathered . In the Siege of Hull , the Parliamentarian garrison defied the King 's authority and drove his forces away from the city . In early August the King moved south , to Lincoln and Leicester , where he secured the contents of the local armouries . On 22 August , he took the decisive step by raising the royal standard in Nottingham , effectively declaring war on Parliament . The Midlands were generally Parliamentarian in sympathy , and few people rallied to the king there , so having again secured the arms and equipment of the local trained bands , Charles moved to Chester and subsequently to Shrewsbury , where large numbers of recruits from Wales and the Welsh border were expected to join him . ( By this point , there was conflict in almost every part of England , as local commanders attempted to seize the main cities , ports and castles for their respective factions ) .
