Civil rights activists became increasingly combative in the 1963 to 1964 period , owing to events such as the thwarting of the Albany campaign , police repression and Ku Klux Klan terrorism in Birmingham , and the assassination of Medgar Evers . Mississippi NAACP Field Director Charles Evers -- Medgar Evers ' brother -- told a public NAACP conference on February 15 , 1964 , that `` non-violence wo n't work in Mississippi ... we made up our minds ... that if a white man shoots at a Negro in Mississippi , we will shoot back . '' The repression of sit - ins in Jacksonville , Florida , provoked a riot that saw black youth throwing Molotov cocktails at police on March 24 , 1964 . Malcolm X gave extensive speeches in this period warning that such militant activity would escalate further if African - Americans ' rights were not fully recognized . In his landmark April 1964 speech `` The Ballot or the Bullet '' , Malcolm presented an ultimatum to white America : `` There 's new strategy coming in . It 'll be Molotov cocktails this month , hand grenades next month , and something else next month . It 'll be ballots , or it 'll be bullets . ''
