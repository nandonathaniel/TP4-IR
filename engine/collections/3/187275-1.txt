3 Doors Down -- 3 Doors Down started out with drummer / vocalist Brad Arnold , bassist Todd Harrell and guitarist Matt Roberts . As the band decided to tour outside of their hometown of Escatawpa , Mississippi and into Foley , Alabama , they came up with their official name as they saw a building with a sign with most of its letters fallen off the sign read `` Doors Down . '' since at the time they started out with 3 band members the name stuck and called themselves 3 Doors Down . 311 -- 311 is an Omaha , Nebraska , police code for indecent exposure . One rainy day , 311 bassist P - Nut and some friends went skinny dipping in a public pool . They were apprehended by police . One of P - Nut 's friends , Jim Watson , was arrested , cuffed ( naked ) , and taken home to his parents . He was issued a citation for a code 311 ( indecent exposure ) . The band found the incident amusing , so they based their name on it . 10cc -- By his own account , Jonathan King chose the name for the band after signing them to his record label UK Records , after having a dream in which he was standing in front of the Hammersmith Odeon in London where the boarding read `` 10cc The Best Band in the World '' . A widely repeated claim , disputed by King , but confirmed in a 1988 interview by Lol Creme and also on the webpage of Graham Gouldman 's current line - up , is that the band name represented a volume of semen that was more than the average amount ejaculated by men ( `` cc '' being an abbreviation of cubic centimetre ) , thus emphasising their potency or prowess . The 1975 -- Lead singer Matthew Healy said in an interview that he came up with the name after discovering an old art journal from a beatnik , with one of the dates listed as `` June 1st , the 1975 '' . Healy said that he thought the placement of `` the '' in a recorded date was intriguing , and decided to use it as the name for the band .
