According to the 2001 National Jewish Population Survey , 4.3 million American Jewish adults have some sort of strong connection to the Jewish community , whether religious or cultural . Jewishness is generally considered an ethnic identity as well as a religious one . Among the 4.3 million American Jews described as `` strongly connected '' to Judaism , over 80 % have some sort of active engagement with Judaism , ranging from attendance at daily prayer services on one end of the spectrum to attending Passover Seders or lighting Hanukkah candles on the other . The survey also discovered that Jews in the Northeast and Midwest are generally more observant than Jews in the South or West . Reflecting a trend also observed among other religious groups , Jews in the Northwestern United States are typically the least observant of tradition .
