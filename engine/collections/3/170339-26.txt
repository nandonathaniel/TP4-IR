Flying back from the Hall of Fame dinner . I was thinking how wonderful it would be if Brian could do a record , and he could do a bunch of things like `` Cool , Cool Water '' , and we 'd get ' em played on all those wave stations , a new age record with Brian Wilson . When I got back to L.A. , Seymour called me and said , in passing , that he was thinking of signing Brian . I said , `` Great ! That 's a brilliant idea . As a matter of fact , I 've been thinking about the same thing . '' And I told Seymour what I thought , about how I wanted to make a record filled with `` Cool , Cool Water '' type of tracks . And Seymour said , `` Why do n't we do half songs and half , '' what I call `` arts and crafts . ''
