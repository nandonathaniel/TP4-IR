Also called learner - centred , a way of teaching that centres on the goals , needs , interests and existing knowledge of the students . Students actively participate in such classrooms and may even be involved in setting learning outcomes . Teachers in student - centred classrooms ask students for input on their goals , needs and interests and on what they know before providing them with study topics or answers to questions ( for example , grammar rules ) . They may also ask students to generate ( help produce ) materials . The teacher is seen more as a facilitator or helper than the dominant figure in the classroom .
