In early 1973 , shortly after assuming the role of United States Attorney for Maryland , George Beall opened an investigation of corruption in Baltimore County , involving public officials , architects , engineering firms , and paving contractors . Beall 's target was the current political leadership in Baltimore County . There were rumors that Agnew might be involved , which Beall initially discounted ; Agnew had not been county executive since December 1966 , and any misdeeds done then would be past the statute of limitations . As part of the investigation , Lester Matz 's engineering firm was served with a subpoena for documents , and through his counsel he sought immunity in exchange for cooperation in the investigation . Matz had been kicking back to Agnew five percent of the value of contracts received through his influence , first county contracts during his term in Towson , and subsequently state contracts while Agnew was governor .
