Interkinesis or interphase II is a period of rest that cells of some species enter during meiosis , between meiosis I and meiosis II . No DNA replication occurs during interkinesis , however it does occur during the interphase I stage of meiosis ( See meiosis I ) . During interkinesis the single spindle of the first meiotic division disassembles and the microtubules reassemble into two new spindles for the second meiotic division . Interkinesis follows telophase I and is where Many plants skip telophase I and interkinesis , going immediately into prophase II . Each chromosome still consists of two chromatids .
