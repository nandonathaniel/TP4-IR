Several receptor groups in the body regulate metabolic breathing . These receptors signal the respiratory center to initiate inhalation or exhalation . Peripheral chemoreceptors are located in the aorta and carotid arteries . They respond to changing blood levels of oxygen , carbon dioxide , and H by signaling the pons and medulla . Irritant and stretch receptors in the lungs can directly cause exhalation . Both sense foreign particles and promote spontaneous coughing . They are also known as mechanoreceptors because they recognize physical changes not chemical changes . Central chemoreceptors in the medulla also recognize chemical variations in H. Specifically , they monitor pH change within the medullary interstitual fluid and cerebral spinal fluid .
