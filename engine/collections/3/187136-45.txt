The Merryman decision created a sensation , but its immediate impact was rather limited , as the president simply ignored the ruling . Indeed , when Lincoln 's dismissal of Chief Justice Taney 's ruling was criticized in a September 1861 editorial by Baltimore newspaper editor Frank Key Howard ( Francis Scott Key 's grandson ) , Howard was himself arrested by order of Lincoln 's Secretary of State Seward and held without trial . Howard described these events in his 1863 book Fourteen Months in American Bastiles , where he noted that he was imprisoned in Fort McHenry , the same fort where the Star Spangled Banner had been waving `` o'er the land of the free '' in his grandfather 's song . Two of the publishers selling his book were then arrested . In all nine newspapers were shut down in Maryland by the federal government , and a dozen newspaper owners and editors like Howard were imprisoned without charges .
