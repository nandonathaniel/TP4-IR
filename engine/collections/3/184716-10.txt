Microbubbles are small `` bubbles '' of mono - lipids that are able to pass through the blood -- brain barrier . They form a lipophilic bubble that can easily move through the barrier . One barrier to this however is that these microbubbles are rather large , which prevents their diffusion into the brain . This is counteracted by a focused ultrasound . The ultrasound increases ) the permeability of the blood -- brain barrier by causing interference in the tight junctions in localized areas . This combined with the microbubbles allows for a very specific area of diffusion for the microbubbles , because they can only diffuse where the ultrasound is disrupting the barrier . The hypothesis and usefulness of these is the possibility of loading a microbubble with an active drug to diffuse through the barrier and target a specific area . There are several important factors in making this a viable solution for drug delivery . The first is that the loaded microbubble must not be substantially greater than the unloaded bubble . This ensures that the diffusion will be similar and the ultrasound disruption will be enough to induce diffusion . A second factor that must be determined is the stability of the loaded micro-bubble . This means is the drug fully retained in the bubble or is there leakage . Lastly , it must be determined how the drug is to be released from the microbubble once it passes through the blood -- brain barrier . Studies have shown the effectiveness of this method for getting drugs to specific sites in the brain in animal models .
