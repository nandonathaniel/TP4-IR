Turkic expansion began in the 6th century , and following the Göktürk empire , Turkic tribes quickly spread westward across all of Central Asia . The Turkic speaking Uyghurs were one of many distinct cultural groups brought together by the trade of the Silk Route at Turfan , which was then ruled by China 's Tang Dynasty . The Uyghurs , primarily pastoral nomads , observed a number of religions including Manichaeism , Buddhism , and Nestorian Christianity . Many of the artefacts from this period were found in the 19th century in this remote desert region .
