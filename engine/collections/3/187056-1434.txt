Term used retrospectively after 1906 for a wide variety of steam battleships built between the 1880s and c. 1905 designed with only a few large guns for long - range fire , relying on an intermediate secondary battery used at shorter ranges for most of their offensive power , and having triple - expansion steam engines . They were rendered obsolete by the revolutionary dreadnought battleships which began to appear in 1906 and which differed from predreadnoughts in having steam turbine propulsion and an `` all - big - gun '' armament layout in which the ship 's primary gun power resided in a primary battery of its largest guns intended for use at long range , with other gun armament limited to small weapons intended for defense against torpedo boats and other small warships .
