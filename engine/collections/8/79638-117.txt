Interesting . While a purist would balk at the idea , it seems , then , that an optimally - palletable `` vodka '' could be made by dilluting nearly - pure ethanol down to 40 % ABV with good water , then perhaps adding trace flavors to smooth out the taste . ( I 'm no chemist ; I do n't know what one might add to `` smooth out '' taste , but I imagine it would be possible . ) It seems like something like this could be created inexpensively and taste better than rot - gut vodka . That is , it would be perfect for the college market . Since , to my knowledge , such a product does not exist even though the inexpensive - but - palletable market certainly does exist , I suspect I 'm missing something . Why does n't such a product exist ? -- BenFrantzDale 21 : 35 , 12 January 2006 ( UTC )
