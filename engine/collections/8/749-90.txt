According to Stevers , the Frijid Pink recording of `` House of the Rising Sun '' was done impromptu when there was time left over at a recording session booked for the group at the Tera Shirma Recording Studios . Stevers later played snippets from that session 's tracks for Paul Cannon , the music director of Detroit 's premier rock radio station , WKNR ; the two knew each other , as Cannon was the father of Stevers 's girlfriend . Stevers recalled , `` we went through the whole thing and ( and Cannon ) did n't say much . Then ' House ( of the Rising Sun ) ' started up and I immediately turned it off because it was n't anything I really wanted him to hear . '' However , Cannon was intrigued and had Stevers play the complete track for him , then advising Stevers , `` Tell Parrot ( Frijid Pink 's label ) to drop God Gave Me You ( the group 's current single ) and go with this one .
