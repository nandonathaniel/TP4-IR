Newton 's laws can be difficult to apply to many kinds of motion because the motion is limited by constraints . For example , a bead on an abacus is constrained to move along its wire and a pendulum bob is constrained to swing at a fixed distance from the pivot . Many such constraints can be incorporated by changing the normal Cartesian coordinates to a set of generalized coordinates that may be fewer in number . Refined mathematical methods have been developed for solving mechanics problems in generalized coordinates . They introduce a generalized momentum , also known as the canonical or conjugate momentum , that extends the concepts of both linear momentum and angular momentum . To distinguish it from generalized momentum , the product of mass and velocity is also referred to as mechanical , kinetic or kinematic momentum . The two main methods are described below .
