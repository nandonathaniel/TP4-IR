A short proof of the irrationality of √ 2 can be obtained from the rational root theorem , that is , if p ( x ) is a monic polynomial with integer coefficients , then any rational root of p ( x ) is necessarily an integer . Applying this to the polynomial p ( x ) = x − 2 , it follows that √ 2 is either an integer or irrational . Because √ 2 is not an integer ( 2 is not a perfect square ) , √ 2 must therefore be irrational . This proof can be generalized to show that any root of any natural number which is not the square of a natural number is irrational .
