`` The Weight '' was performed by Jimmy Fallon and The Muppets in the closing moments of the final episode of Late Night with Jimmy Fallon on February 7 , 2014 . The performance ( which mirrored the arrangement and staging of the Band 's performance of the song with the Staple Singers in The Last Waltz ) featured several notable Muppet characters including Kermit the Frog , Miss Piggy , and Dr. Teeth and The Electric Mayhem , and ended with Fallon walking out of the Late Night studio , down the hall , and into the new studio of The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon .
