In the 1975 season , Cincinnati clinched the NL West with 108 victories , then swept the Pittsburgh Pirates in three games to win the NL pennant . In the World Series , the Boston Red Sox were the opponents . After splitting the first four games , the Reds took Game 5 . After a three - day rain delay , the two teams met in Game 6 , one of the most memorable baseball games ever played and considered by many to be the best World Series game ever . The Reds were ahead 6 -- 3 with 5 outs left , when the Red Sox tied the game on former Red Bernie Carbo 's three - run home run . It was Carbo 's second pinch - hit three - run homer in the series . After a few close - calls either way , Carlton Fisk hit a dramatic 12th inning home run off the foul pole in left field to give the Red Sox a 7 -- 6 win and force a deciding Game 7 . Cincinnati prevailed the next day when Morgan 's RBI single won Game 7 and gave the Reds their first championship in 35 years . The Reds have not lost a World Series game since Carlton Fisk 's home run , a span of 9 straight wins .
