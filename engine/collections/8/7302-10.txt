Boer ( / ˈboʊ. ər , bɔːr , bʊər / ; Afrikaans : ( buːr ) ) is the Dutch and Afrikaans noun for `` farmer '' , or , as a present tense verb , `` to farm '' . In Afrikaans it still is the only unqualified , context - independent translation of `` farmer '' . In South African contexts , it also denotes the descendants of the then Dutch - speaking settlers of the eastern Cape frontier in Southern Africa during the 18th and much of the 19th century . For a long time the Dutch East India Company controlled this area , but it was eventually taken over by the United Kingdom and incorporated into the British Empire .
