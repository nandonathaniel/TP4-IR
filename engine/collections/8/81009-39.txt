Proposals that one type of animal , even humans , could descend from other types of animals , are known to go back to the first pre-Socratic Greek philosophers . Anaximander of Miletus ( c. 610 -- 546 BC ) proposed that the first animals lived in water , during a wet phase of the Earth 's past , and that the first land - dwelling ancestors of mankind must have been born in water , and only spent part of their life on land . He also argued that the first human of the form known today must have been the child of a different type of animal ( probably a fish ) , because man needs prolonged nursing to live . In the late nineteenth century , Anaximander was hailed as the `` first Darwinist '' , but this characterization is no longer commonly agreed . Anaximander 's hypothesis could be considered `` evolution '' in a sense , although not a Darwinian one .
