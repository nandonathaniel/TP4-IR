Christianity was restored among the East Saxons in the late 7th century and it is presumed that either the Anglo - Saxon cathedral was restored or a new building erected as the seat of bishops such as Cedd , Wine and Earconwald , the last of whom was buried in the cathedral in 693 . This building , or a successor , was destroyed by fire in 962 , but rebuilt in the same year .
