The sky of a comet changes dramatically as it nears the Sun . During perihelion , a comet 's ices begin to sublime from its surface , forming tails of gas and dust , and a coma . An observer on a comet nearing the Sun might see the stars slightly obscured by a milky haze , which could create halo effects around the Sun and other bright objects .
