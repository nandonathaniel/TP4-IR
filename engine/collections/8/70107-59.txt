The two widely used forms of modern RAM are static RAM ( SRAM ) and dynamic RAM ( DRAM ) . In SRAM , a bit of data is stored using the state of a six transistor memory cell . This form of RAM is more expensive to produce , but is generally faster and requires less dynamic power than DRAM . In modern computers , SRAM is often used as cache memory for the CPU . DRAM stores a bit of data using a transistor and capacitor pair , which together comprise a DRAM cell . The capacitor holds a high or low charge ( 1 or 0 , respectively ) , and the transistor acts as a switch that lets the control circuitry on the chip read the capacitor 's state of charge or change it . As this form of memory is less expensive to produce than static RAM , it is the predominant form of computer memory used in modern computers .
