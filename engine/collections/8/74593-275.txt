In early May , Jean - Claude Juncker said that the UK leaving the EU was a `` tragedy '' and that it is partly the responsibility of the EU . `` The EU , in many respects has done too much , especially the Commission '' , including `` too much regulation and too many interferences in the lives of our fellow citizens '' . The European Commission has , following the `` Better regulation '' initiative , in place since before Brexit , reduced the number of legislative proposals from 130 to 23 per year .
