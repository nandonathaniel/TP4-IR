On numerous occasions , television specials have been aired for the series in which the usual events of regular episodes are altered , threatened , or replaced . Usually said specials will present Dora with a bigger , more whimsical adventure than usual or with a magical task that must be fulfilled , or perhaps even offer a series of different adventures for Boots and Dora to travel through . They might be presented with an unusual , difficult task ( such as assisting Swiper in his attempts to be erased from Santa Claus 's Naughty List ) that normally is not featured in average episodes , or challenge Dora with a goal that must be achieved ( such as the emancipation of a trapped mermaid ) . Sometimes , the specials have involved the debut of new characters , such as the birth of Dora 's superpowered twin baby siblings and the introduction of the enchanted anthropomorphic stars that accompany Dora on many of her quests .
