Forbes Field , home of the Pittsburgh Pirates from the middle of the 1909 season until the middle of the 1970 season , is the only long - term major league ballpark where a no - hitter was never thrown during its existence . There are several recently built fields where no - hitters have not yet been thrown . Six parks presently in existence for a decade or more have only seen one no - hitter each : Coors Field , the hitter - friendly home of the Colorado Rockies ( Hideo Nomo on September 17 , 1996 ) ; the Orioles ' current home , Oriole Park at Camden Yards , known for being hitter friendly ( Nomo on April 4 , 2001 ) ; Miller Park , the home of the Milwaukee Brewers which is known for being hitter - friendly ( Carlos Zambrano of the `` visiting '' Chicago Cubs on September 14 , 2008 against the `` home '' Astros in a game displaced by Hurricane Ike ) , PNC Park , the current home of the Pirates , which like Forbes Field is known for being hitter - friendly ( Homer Bailey on September 28 , 2012 ) ; Petco Park , home of the San Diego Padres , which initially was known as a pitcher 's park but was modified with shorter fences in 2013 ( Tim Lincecum on July 13 , 2013 ) ; and Minute Maid Park , the home of the Houston Astros which is known for the short Crawford Boxes in left and for its deep outfield in center ( Mike Fiers on August 21 , 2015 ) .
