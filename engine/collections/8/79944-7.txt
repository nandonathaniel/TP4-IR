Despite these proposals , Protozoa emerged as the preferred taxonomic placement for heterotrophic microorganisms such as amoebae and ciliates , and remained so for more than a century . In the course of the 20th century , however , the old `` two kingdom '' system began to weaken , with the growing awareness that fungi did not belong among the plants , and that most of the unicellular protozoa were no more closely related to the animals than they were to the plants . By mid-century , some biologists , such as Herbert Copeland , Robert H. Whittaker and Lynn Margulis , advocated the revival of Haeckel 's Protista or Hogg 's Protoctista as a kingdom - level eukaryotic group , alongside Plants , Animals and Fungi . A variety of multi-kingdom systems were proposed , and Kingdoms Protista and Protoctista became well established in biology texts and curricula .
