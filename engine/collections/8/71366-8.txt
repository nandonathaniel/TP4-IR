During this period a significant factor behind the transfer of peninsular Korean culture to Japan was immigration from Korea . Most peninsular immigrants , generically known as kikajin in Japanese , came during a period of intense regional warfare which racked the Korean peninsula between the late fourth and late seventh centuries . Japanese traditions held that the Yamato kingdom has sent military expeditions to assist Baekje as early as 369 CE , military aid that is said to have enabled the latter to secure control of Naktong against its enemies , Silla and Goguryeo .
