Mineral processing can involve four general types of unit operation : comminution -- particle size reduction ; sizing -- separation of particle sizes by screening or classification ; concentration by taking advantage of physical and surface chemical properties ; and dewatering -- solid / liquid separation . In all of these processes , the most important considerations are the economics of the processes and this is dictated by the grade and recovery of the final product . To do this , the mineralogy of the ore needs to be considered as this dictates the amount of liberation required and the processes that can occur . The smaller the particles processes , the greater the theoretical grade and recovery of the final product , but this however is difficult to do with fine particles as they prevent certain concentration processes from occurring .
