Otoacoustic emissions are due to a wave exiting the cochlea via the oval window , and propagating back through the middle ear to the eardrum , and out the ear canal , where it can be picked up by a microphone . Otoacoustic emissions are important in some types of tests for hearing impairment , since they are present when the cochlea is working well , and less so when it is suffering from loss of OHC activity .
