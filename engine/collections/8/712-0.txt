Capital punishment in Canada dates back to Canada 's earliest history , including its period as a French colony and , after 1763 , its time as a British colony . From 1867 to the elimination of the death penalty for murder on July 14 , 1976 , 1,481 people had been sentenced to death , and 710 had been executed . Of those executed , 697 were men and 13 were women . The only method used in Canada for capital punishment of civilians after the end of the French regime was hanging . The last execution in Canada was the double hanging of Arthur Lucas and Ronald Turpin on December 11 , 1962 , at Toronto 's Don Jail .
