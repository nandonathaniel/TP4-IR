Meanwhile , Lady Dedlock is also a beneficiary under one of the wills . Early in the book , while listening to the reading of an affidavit by the family solicitor , Mr Tulkinghorn , she recognises the handwriting on the copy . The sight affects her so much she almost faints , which Tulkinghorn notices and investigates . He traces the copyist , a pauper known only as `` Nemo , '' in London . Nemo has recently died , and the only person to identify him is a street - sweeper , a poor homeless boy named Jo , who lives in a particularly grim and poverty - stricken part of the city known as Tom - All - Alone 's .
