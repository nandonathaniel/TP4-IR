During May , June , and July , the Northern Hemisphere is exposed to more direct sunlight because the hemisphere faces the Sun . The same is true of the Southern Hemisphere in November , December , and January . It is Earth 's axial tilt that causes the Sun to be higher in the sky during the summer months , which increases the solar flux . However , due to seasonal lag , June , July , and August are the warmest months in the Northern Hemisphere while December , January , and February are the warmest months in the Southern Hemisphere .
