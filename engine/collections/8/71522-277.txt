I agree with TSRibeye 's latest theme . If authoritative sources can be found , and cited , for use of the word extra then use of that extra word in this article is reasonable . Conversely , if no authoritative source can be found then the word extra should not be used in the article . The argument put forward by JRSpriggs is a sound one and I do n't disagree with it , but in the absence of a citable source it is merely original research . At WP : V there is the instruction that The threshhold for inclusion in Wikipedia is verifiability , not truth . Dolphin ( t ) 02 : 16 , 25 June 2010 ( UTC )
