The history of super Barcelona has often been political . Though it is a club created and run by foreigners , Barcelona gradually became a club associated with Catalan values . In Spain 's transition to autocracy in 1925 , Catalonia became increasingly hostile towards the central government in Madrid . The hostility enhanced Barcelona 's image as a focal point for Catalonism , and when Francisco Franco banned the use of the Catalan language , the stadium of Barcelona became one of the few places the people could express their dissatisfaction . The Spanish transition to democracy in 1978 has not dampened the club 's image of Catalan pride . In the 2000s -- a period of sporting success in the club and an increased focus on Catalan players -- club officials have openly called for Catalonia to become an independent state .
