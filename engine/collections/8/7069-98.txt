Jack is annoyed at that revelation , but later comes to relish it and he and Drew go at it in the bathroom . In the next episode , Jack and Drew start seeing each other secretly and Jack , nervous about screwing things up too soon , advises a reluctant Drew to hold off on coming out to Angela for the time being . He even supports the alibi of them being just guy friends by having Karen pose as his wife . However , Karen , reminded of her mother 's unhappiness in her marriage , outs both Jack and Drew in front of Angela , who is surprisingly supportive and arranges a coming out party for Drew , much to Jack 's distress . Jack admits to Drew that he fears missing out on other great men in his life , but when Karen reminds him of his fear of being old and lonely , which is even worse , he decides to give Drew another chance . In `` One Job '' , after two months of dating , Drew breaks up with Jack , admitting he is not ready for a serious commitment at the moment and wants to see other people . Jack is devastated at the breakup , as he realises that he is now ready to settle down with someone .
