Bale scored his first goal of the season on 24 September 2011 , in an away game against Wigan Athletic . The game ended in a 2 -- 1 victory for Tottenham . He added his second and third goals of the season on 30 October with two goals against Queens Park Rangers in a 3 -- 1 home win . He continued his good form with the first goal in a 3 -- 1 victory over Fulham the following week , whilst also setting up Aaron Lennon who made it 2 -- 0 on the stroke of half time . The first goal against Fulham was later ruled by the `` dubious goals committee '' to be an own goal by Chris Baird .
