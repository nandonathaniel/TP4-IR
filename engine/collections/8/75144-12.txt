In 2009 , 29 U.S. states allowed sales of raw milk in some form . In other parts of the world , raw milk can often be bought directly from the farmer . Arizona , Utah , California and Washington allow raw milk sales in retail stores with appropriate warning labeling . As of May 2010 , Massachusetts only allows direct sales from farm to consumer , resulting in `` buying clubs '' where consumers pool transportation resources to obtain raw milk more conveniently . In April 2013 , the State of North Dakota passed a law that authorizes the use of herd shares .
