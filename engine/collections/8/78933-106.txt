Lake Erie is a favorite for divers since there are many shipwrecks , perhaps 1,400 to 8,000 according to one estimate , of which about 270 are `` confirmed shipwreck locations . '' Most wrecks are undiscovered but believed to be well preserved and in good condition and at most only 200 feet ( 61 m ) below the water surface . One report suggests there are more `` wrecks per square mile '' than any other freshwater location , including wrecks from Native American watercraft . There are efforts to identify shipwreck sites and survey the lake floor to map the location of underwater sites , possibly for further study or exploration . While the lake is relatively warmer than the other Great Lakes , there is a thermocline , meaning that as a diver descends , the water temperature drops about 30 degrees Fahrenheit change ( 17 Â° C ) , requiring a wetsuit . One estimate is that Lake Erie has a quarter of all 8,000 estimated shipwrecks in the Great Lakes . They are preserved because the water is cold and salt - free creating `` intact time capsules down there '' . Divers have a policy of not removing or touching anything at the wreck else the `` next person wo n't be able to see it '' ; when artifacts were removed on occasion , it was met by `` outrage '' by the diving community . The cold conditions make diving difficult and `` strenuous '' requiring divers with skill and experience . One charter firm from western New York State takes about 1,500 divers to Lake Erie shipwrecks in a typical season from April through October .
