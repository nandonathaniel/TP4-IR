In January 2017 , San Jose , which has the largest population of Vietnamese people in the United States , banned the Vietnamese flag from being displayed on city flagpoles . This was inspired by a 2016 policy adopted by Westminster , California forbidding the display of the flag on city property . Nearby Milpitas also banned the flag from municipal display on September 5 , 2017 .
