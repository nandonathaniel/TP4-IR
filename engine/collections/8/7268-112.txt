The Londoner production is known to have been the first to have selected non-African actresses to perform as Rafiki , since actresses Josette Bushell - Mingo ( 1999 -- 2001 ) and Sharon D. Clarke ( 2001 -- 2003 ) are English , though their understudies were South African . The American tour companies followed this when Fredi Walker and Fuchsia Walker were chosen as Rafiki in 2001 as leadings for the first American tour and the Los Angeles one , respectively .
