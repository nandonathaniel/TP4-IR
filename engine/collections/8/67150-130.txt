From 1536 , Henry VIII decided to conquer Ireland and bring it under crown control . The Fitzgerald dynasty of Kildare , who had become the effective rulers of Ireland in the 15th century , had become unreliable allies of the Tudor monarchs . They had invited Burgundian troops into Dublin to crown the Yorkist pretender , Lambert Simnel as King of England in 1487 . Again in 1536 , Silken Thomas Fitzgerald went into open rebellion against the crown . Having put down this rebellion , Henry resolved to bring Ireland under English government control so the island would not become a base for future rebellions or foreign invasions of England . In 1541 , he upgraded Ireland from a lordship to a full Kingdom . Henry was proclaimed King of Ireland at a meeting of the Irish Parliament that year . This was the first meeting of the Irish Parliament to be attended by the Gaelic Irish chieftains as well as the Hiberno - Norman aristocracy . With the institutions of government in place , the next step was to extend the control of the English Kingdom of Ireland over all of its claimed territory . This took nearly a century , with various English administrations either negotiating or fighting with the independent Irish and Old English lords . The Spanish Armada in Ireland suffered heavy losses during an extraordinary season of storms in the autumn of 1588 . Among the survivors was Captain Francisco de Cuellar , who gave a remarkable account of his experiences on the run in Ireland .
