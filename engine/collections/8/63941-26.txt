From the 8th century to the 13th century in Muslim lands many crops and plants were planted along Muslim trade routes , farming techniques spread . In addition to changes in economy , population distribution , vegetation cover , agricultural production , population levels , urban growth , the distribution of the labour force , and numerous other aspects of life in the Islamic world were affected according to Andrew Watson . However this is disputed by other scholars , who claim cultivation and consumption of staples such as durum wheat , Asiatic rice , and sorghum as well as cotton were already commonplace centuries before , or that agricultural production declined in areas brought under Muslim rule in the Middle Ages .
