Longest international highway The Pan-American Highway , which connects many countries in the Americas , is nearly 25,000 kilometres ( 15,534 mi ) long as of 2005 . The Pan-American Highway is discontinuous because there is a significant gap in it in southeastern Panama , where the rainfall is immense and the terrain is entirely unsuitable for highway construction . Longest national highway ( point to point ) Trans - Canada Highway has two routes , with the northern Route spanning 7,821 km ( 4,860 mi ) long as of 2006 alone , and over 10,700 km long including the southern portion .
