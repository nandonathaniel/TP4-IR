The New England Patriots won the opening coin toss and elected to defer to the second half . The Patriots kicked to the Eagles who opened with a long time consuming drive of 7 : 05 and resulted in a 25 - yard Jake Elliott field goal , giving the Eagles a 3 -- 0 lead . The drive was controlled by the arm of Eagles quarterback Nick Foles , who went 6 - for - 9 for 61 yards and completed passes to five different receivers , with a few short runs by LeGarrette Blount and Jay Ajayi littered in . Foles also made two critical completions on third down plays , hitting Alshon Jeffery for a 17 - yard gain on third - and - 4 , and later finding Torrey Smith for 15 yards on third - and - 12 . The Patriots responded with a drive of their own , almost with the exact same results ; quarterback Tom Brady going 6 - for - 8 for 60 yards to four different receivers , the longest a 28 - yard pass to Chris Hogan . The drive stalled out on the Eagles 8 - yard line , where they had to settle for Stephen Gostkowski 's 26 - yard field goal , tying the game at 3 -- 3 . The game 's first touchdown was scored by the Eagles on the next drive , taking only three plays : a short pass from Foles to Nelson Agholor , a 36 - yard run up the middle by Blount , and a 34 - yard touchdown pass from Foles to Jeffery to the left side of the field . The ensuing extra point missed as it was wide right , however , leaving the score at 9 -- 3 . On the next Patriots drive , they took the ball to the Philadelphia 11 - yard line , mainly on the strength of a 50 - yard completion from Brady to Danny Amendola , where the quarter ended .
