This would be the first FIFA World Cup held in three countries , the first World Cup held in Canada , the second World Cup held in the United States , and the third World Cup held in Mexico ( making Mexico the first nation to host three World Cups , after the 1970 and 1986 World Cups ) . There are some concerns with Canada 's lack of natural grass in stadiums that could host the games as well as concerns regarding Mexico 's high crime rate .
