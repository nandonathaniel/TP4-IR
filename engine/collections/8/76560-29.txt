After Orin finishes with his masochistic patient , Arthur Denton ( Bill Murray ) , who requested `` a long , slow , root canal '' , Seymour books an appointment with Orin and arms himself with a revolver ; however , he can not bring himself to use it . Orin , who abuses nitrous oxide , puts on a type of venturi mask to receive a constant flow of the gas . Accidentally breaking an intake valve and unable to remove the mask , Orin begs Seymour for help removing it , but Seymour does nothing . When Orin asks Seymour what he ever did to him , Seymour coldly replies `` Nothing , it 's what you did to her . '' Orin dies from asphyxiation and Seymour drags his body back to Audrey II . While dismembering the body to feed to the plant , Seymour is unknowingly witnessed by Mushnik , who flees in fear .
