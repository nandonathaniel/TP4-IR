The Allied counteroffensive , known as the Hundred Days Offensive , began on 8 August 1918 , with the Battle of Amiens . The battle involved over 400 tanks and 120,000 British , Dominion , and French troops , and by the end of its first day a gap 24 kilometres ( 15 mi ) long had been created in the German lines . The defenders displayed a marked collapse in morale , causing Ludendorff to refer to this day as the `` Black Day of the German army '' . After an advance as far as 23 kilometres ( 14 mi ) , German resistance stiffened , and the battle was concluded on 12 August .
