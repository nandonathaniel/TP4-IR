The International Food Study Institute had a brief on a collection of extensive studies that analyzed the causes of poverty , analyzing household data and reviewing empirical research in 20 countries . They found that some of the major causes of poverty were the inability of poor households to invest in property and education , limited access to credit , in some cases these instances produce more poverty via inherited poverty . The systematic exclusion of ethnic minorities , scheduled castes , tribes , women and people with disabilities and health issues . Persistence of poverty is partially attributed to these classes not having access to institutions and markets .
