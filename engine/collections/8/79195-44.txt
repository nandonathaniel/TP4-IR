In 1949 , the club unveiled a modernised crest featuring the same style of cannon below the club 's name , set in blackletter , and above the coat of arms of the Metropolitan Borough of Islington and a scroll inscribed with the club 's newly adopted Latin motto , Victoria Concordia Crescit - `` victory comes from harmony '' -- coined by the club 's programme editor Harry Homer . For the first time , the crest was rendered in colour , which varied slightly over the crest 's lifespan , finally becoming red , gold and green . Because of the numerous revisions of the crest , Arsenal were unable to copyright it . Although the club had managed to register the crest as a trademark , and had fought ( and eventually won ) a long legal battle with a local street trader who sold `` unofficial '' Arsenal merchandise , Arsenal eventually sought a more comprehensive legal protection . Therefore , in 2002 they introduced a new crest featuring more modern curved lines and a simplified style , which was copyrightable . The cannon once again faces east and the club 's name is written in a sans - serif typeface above the cannon . Green was replaced by dark blue . The new crest was criticised by some supporters ; the Arsenal Independent Supporters ' Association claimed that the club had ignored much of Arsenal 's history and tradition with such a radical modern design , and that fans had not been properly consulted on the issue . Until the 1960s , a badge was worn on the playing shirt only for high - profile matches such as FA Cup finals , usually in the form of a monogram of the club 's initials in red on a white background .
