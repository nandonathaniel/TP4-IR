Instead of logically tying the endpoint of the network tunnel to the physical IP address , each tunnel is bound to a permanently associated IP address at the device . The mobile VPN software handles the necessary network authentication and maintains the network sessions in a manner transparent to the application and the user . The Host Identity Protocol ( HIP ) , under study by the Internet Engineering Task Force , is designed to support mobility of hosts by separating the role of IP addresses for host identification from their locator functionality in an IP network . With HIP a mobile host maintains its logical connections established via the host identity identifier while associating with different IP addresses when roaming between access networks .
