Queensland and New South Wales has a 5 days `` cooling off '' period for residential contracts . Victoria has a 3 business day cooling off period on private sales and South Australia has 2 days . This time allows the purchaser to reconsider the purchase and enable them to cancel the contract if they so wish , in which case the purchaser may be legally bound to pay 0.25 % of the purchasing price to the seller ( 0.2 % in Victoria ) . Not all contracts have a cooling off period such as when the property is purchased at auction .
