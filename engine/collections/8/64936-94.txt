Leonardo da Vinci called the mirror the `` master of painters '' . He recommended , `` When you wish to see whether your whole picture accords with what you have portrayed from nature take a mirror and reflect the actual object in it . Compare what is reflected with your painting and carefully consider whether both likenesses of the subject correspond , particularly in regard to the mirror . ''
