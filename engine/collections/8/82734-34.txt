Less heavily armoured soldiers were more vulnerable than knights . For example , enemy crossbowmen were forced to retreat at Cr√©cy when deployed without their protecting pavises . Horses were generally less well protected than the knights themselves ; shooting the French knights ' horses from the side ( where they were less well armoured ) is described by contemporary accounts of the Battle of Poitiers ( 1356 ) , and at Agincourt John Keegan has argued that the main effect of the longbow would have been in injuring the horses of the mounted French knights .
