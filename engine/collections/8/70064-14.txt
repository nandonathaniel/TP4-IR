While records do not exist which describe his childhood or years before his abduction , a description of the social world in which he lived during his formative years may provide some insight . The interrelated societies that lived in southern New England at the time of English settlement attempts at the beginning of the 17th century referred to themselves as Ninnimissinuok , a variation of the Narragansett word Ninnimissinn»ówock , meaning roughly `` people '' and signifying `` familiarity and shared identity . '' Squanto 's band or tribe , the Patuxet , occupied the coastal area west of Cape Cod Bay . Squanto himself told an English trader that the Patuxet once numbered 2,000 . They spoke a dialect of Eastern Algonquian common to peoples as far west as Narragansett Bay . The various Algonquian dialects of Southern New England were sufficiently similar to allow effective communications . The term patuxet refers to the site of Plymouth , Massachusetts and , according to some writers ( who may have misunderstood their source ) , means `` at the little falls . '' Politically it has been generally ( although not universally ) inferred that the Patuxet had been subjugated by the so - called Wampanoags ( Pokanoket ) and made part of the so - called Wampanoag confederacy . Since the Patuxet had been decimated by disease before European settlement ( see below ) , there are no written records of Patuxet life by first - hand observers . In such a case reasonable conclusions about a culture 's organization and beliefs may be made by reference to other tribes in the same area `` which may be expected to share cultural traits . '' In this case the Southern New England tribes were closely related linguistically ( through similar Algonquin languages ) , politically ( by the Pokanoket suzerainty ) , economically ( by trade ) and ethnically .
