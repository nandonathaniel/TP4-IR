Aqua - Lung was the original English name of the first open - circuit , self - contained underwater breathing apparatus ( or `` SCUBA '' ) to reach worldwide popularity and commercial success . This class of equipment is now commonly referred to as a diving regulator or demand valve . The Aqua - Lung was invented in Paris during the winter of 1942 -- 1943 by two Frenchmen : the engineer Ã‰mile Gagnan and Naval Lieutenant ( `` lieutenant de vaisseau '' ) Jacques Cousteau . It allowed Cousteau and Gagnan to film and explore more easily underwater .
