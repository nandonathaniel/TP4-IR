Prokhorov has never been married and is acknowledged as one of the world 's most eligible bachelors . Shortly after purchasing the Nets , he vowed to get married if the Nets had not won the NBA championship within five years . In July 2015 , he rescinded the pledge , saying that NBA Commissioner Adam Silver had `` taken his place '' by marrying his fiancee in May .
