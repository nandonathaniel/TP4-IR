At the Races is the only Sky Sports channel not wholly - owned by Sky , although Sky purchased majority control of it in 2017 . It was founded by the Go Racing consortium , a partnership of Channel 4 , BSkyB and Arena Leisure plc ( owner of Ascot Racecourse , and acting on behalf of a further 27 out of the 59 UK racecourses ) in July 2004 . Following its high - profile collapse ( and Channel 4 removing itself from the consortium ) the station -- now purely a joint venture between BSkyB and Arena Leisure -- focuses on horse racing from the UK , Ireland , North America and Germany , showing many live races and related shows . The station is `` affiliated '' with various betting companies , since gamblers are generally the sport 's main audience , and its pictures , provided by satellite link provider SIS , are also commercially distributed to betting shops across the country .
