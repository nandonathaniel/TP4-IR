McClennan J. described Cross ' experiments as `` unsophisticated '' and in the summation of his decision said that he was not satisfied by either of the two motives presented by the Crown . Regarding the motive submitted by Tedeschi that Caroline had information about Rivkin 's business dealings that Wood was trying to hide , McClennan said `` The exploitation of public rumour and the use of mere innuendo to compensate for inadequate evidence of motive is not consistent with the obligations of a prosecutor to press the Crown case `` to its legitimate strength '' by reliance upon credible evidence `` . McLennan was also troubled that the notion Caroline may have been unconscious when she left the cliff top was introduced by the Crown late in the case . He described Tedeschi 's suggestion , first made in his closing address and mentioned at no other time in evidence , that a `` shot - put '' action was used to despatch Caroline as `` an invention of the prosecutor ... for which there was absolutely no support in evidence '' . McClennan also expressed some doubt as the reliability of evidence concerning the claimed sightings of Wood and Byrne at Watson 's Bay on 7 June 1995 noting that some of these witnesses had come forward years after the event and the initial investigations ; he raised concerns that the Melbourne / Martin first identification of Wood and Byrne was based on a specific photos shown to them by Dally - Watkins rather than from being picked from a selection . Tedeschi was criticised by McClellan for presenting reasoning that was `` dangerous '' and `` entirely without foundation '' . Tedeschi contributed to the alleged miscarriage with his `` 50 killer questions '' which took an `` impermissible course '' in asking the jury to consider rhetorical questions dealing with matters that had not been presented with in evidence . McClennan ruled that he was not persuaded that Sgt Powderly 's evidence regarding the changed landing position of the body was entirely reliable .
