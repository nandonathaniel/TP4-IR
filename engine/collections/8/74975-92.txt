During the 2008 offseason , the Bucs re-signed head coach Gruden and general manager Allen through the 2011 season . They also acquired former players Warrick Dunn , who had spent the last 6 seasons with the Atlanta Falcons , and Brian Griese , who was the starting quarterback for the team in 2005 until a knee injury sidelined him for the remainder of the year . Chris Simms was finally released , having not played in a game since his injury in 2006 . The Bucs got off to a great start in 2008 , with a 9 -- 3 record going into the final month of the season , tied for first place in the division , with a chance at the top seed in the conference . On December 2 , it was announced that defensive coordinator Monte Kiffin would be leaving the team after the season 's end , for the same job at the University of Tennessee , serving under his son Lane Kiffin , who had just been named the new head coach at the school . After the announcement , the Buccaneers would lose their final four games of the season to finish 9 -- 7 for the second consecutive season . Unlike 2007 , it was not enough to secure the division championship , nor a playoff appearance .
