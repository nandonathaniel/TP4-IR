Most treaties on international law asserts that territorial change effects `` automatically '' a change of the nationality concerned unless there be special stipulations in the respective treaties . Which people are affected is often in dispute , but the people who are actually concerned are said to become automatically nationals of the successor State , i.e. they lose the old and immediately acquire the new nationality through the very act of annexation , cession , etc . Mostly , the existence of a rule of international law to that effect is assumed .
