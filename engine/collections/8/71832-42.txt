Round 2 was originally the `` Tabloid Headlines Round '' , in which the panellists identified and commented on the more flippant stories of the week from sufficiently pun - filled tabloid headlines . Another of the original rounds later dropped was the similar `` Mini-Headlines Round '' , where the panel had to identify a story from the four words used in the original tabloid report as effective chapter headings . In 2004 , the headlines were filtered out and replaced with a picture game . An image is slowly revealed to the teams , the object being for one to buzz in before the other and guess how the resulting person or object is relevant to the week 's news . Originally this took the form of the `` Picture - Spin Quiz '' . Regular variants since have included the `` Jigsaw of News '' and the Christmas - themed `` Giblets of News '' , while others have featured wieldy props for the host , such as the `` Wheel of News '' , the `` One - Armed Bandit of News '' and the `` Strengthometer of News '' . A few versions have been more specific to that week 's guest host ; e.g. Dominic West , star of American cop drama The Wire , had the `` Squad Car of News '' . Occasionally the round is themed around one topic . In these instances , it usually becomes a more straightforward Q&A ' fingers - on - buzzers ' round . Another slight variation is a spoof of an existing quiz / gameshow , often done when pertinent to the current guests . For example ; a mock Mastermind game when Magnus Magnusson appeared or the infamous `` Play Your Iraqi Cards Right '' from Bruce Forsyth 's first time as host , which took the format of the presenter 's former game show , as well as referencing a special deck of cards produced by the Americans for the 2003 invasion of Iraq .
