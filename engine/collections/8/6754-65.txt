Tina Pinciotti ( played by Amanda Fuller ) was the younger sister of regular Donna Pinciotti . She first appeared in `` Eric 's Burger Job '' , but made no appearances following that , except for a brief mention in the episode `` Vanstock '' . A similar situation occurred with unseen Valerie Pinciotti . The two are later written out with no explanation , as demonstrated in the season seven premiere , when Kitty refers to Donna as Bob and Midge 's only daughter
