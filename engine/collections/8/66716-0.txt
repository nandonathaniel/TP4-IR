The Palace of Versailles is a royal château in Versailles , in the Île - de-France region of France . When the château was built , Versailles was a country village ; today , however , it is a suburb of Paris , some 20 kilometres southwest of the French capital . The court of Versailles was the centre of political power in France from 1682 , when Louis XIV moved from Paris , until the royal family was forced to return to the capital in October 1789 after the beginning of the French Revolution . Versailles is therefore famous not only as a building , but as well as a symbol of the system of absolute monarchy of the Ancien Régime .
