In 1988 , the earliest known official or large - scale celebration of Pi Day was organized by Larry Shaw at the San Francisco Exploratorium , where Shaw worked as a physicist , with staff and public marching around one of its circular spaces , then consuming fruit pies . The Exploratorium continues to hold Pi Day celebrations .
