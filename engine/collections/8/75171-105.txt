When Frederick III needed the dukes to finance a war against Hungary in 1486 , and at the same time had his son ( later Maximilian I ) elected king , he faced a demand from the united dukes for their participation in an Imperial Court . For the first time , the assembly of the electors and other dukes was now called the Imperial Diet ( German Reichstag ) ( to be joined by the Imperial Free Cities later ) . While Frederick refused , his more conciliatory son finally convened the Diet at Worms in 1495 , after his father 's death in 1493 . Here , the king and the dukes agreed on four bills , commonly referred to as the Reichsreform ( Imperial Reform ) : a set of legal acts to give the disintegrating Empire some structure . For example , this act produced the Imperial Circle Estates and the Reichskammergericht ( Imperial Chamber Court ) , institutions that would -- to a degree -- persist until the end of the Empire in 1806 .
