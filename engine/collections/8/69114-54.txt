The Home and Away opening titles sequence was initially used to introduce the regular characters in the show . The sequences often featured the characters in couple shots or with family and friends , and showed them in familiar settings around Summer Bay such as the beach . The titles for the show 's earlier years featured black brush stroke cutouts around the character shots . 2004 saw Home and Away introduce new picture frame - style opening titles , with characters shown posing in and out of large picture frames in front of beach backgrounds . In January 2007 , the show debuted new opening titles along with a new version of the theme song . The picture - frame style was still used , but this time the titles featured framed pictures of the characters . In 2009 , the opening was reduced to 15 seconds and the characters were removed from the titles for the first time in Home and Away 's history . They were replaced by a large photo collage showing various locations around Summer Bay . The decision to remove the cast and shorten the titles was due to time restrictions . Since then , many viewers in Australia and the UK have wanted the full - length title sequence with the cast to return .
