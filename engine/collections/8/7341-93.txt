Alana Rivera is Raven 's ex-best friend . She finds great pleasure in teasing and bullying Raven . She hangs out with her posse , which includes followers Muffy and Loka . She was first introduced in Season 2 in the episode `` Do n't Have a Cow '' . In `` Run Raven Run '' , we learn that Alana and Raven were best friends until 4th grade when a school play had them both competing for the role of the Tooth Fairy ( which Raven got , while Alana portrayed the tooth decay ) , and would ultimately end their friendship . Alana and Raven almost became friends again when Raven `` teamed up '' with Alana 's posse ( in the episode `` Clothes Minded '' ) , which happens after Chelsea and Eddie do not support Raven 's school `` protest '' . In the episode `` Run , Raven , Run '' , Raven and Alana briefly become friends until Chelsea reveals that Raven put chewing gum in Alana 's hair . This causes her to get her head shaved and covered up . Alana , Muffy , and Loka also spend the night at Raven 's house in the episode `` Shake , Rattle , and Rae '' . In this episode , Raven and Alana almost become friends again , until Alana announces that `` the score is 1 -- 0 '' . She was replaced in season 3 by Bianca ( Erica Rivera ) , because , according to Muffy , she was so bad , she got sent to military school , while Bianca was so bad that she got kicked out of military school .
