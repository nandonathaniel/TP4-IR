A 2005 Bill , H.R. 2389 , to prohibit the Supreme Court 's and most federal courts from considering any legal challenges to the government 's requiring or promoting of the Pledge of Allegiance , died in the Senate after having passed in the House . This action is viewed in general as court stripping by Congress of the constitutional power of the judiciary . Even if a similar bill is enacted , its practical effect may not be clear : proponents of the bill have said that it is a valid exercise of Congress 's power to regulate the jurisdiction of the federal courts under Article III , Section 2 of the Constitution , but opponents say Congress does not have the authority to prevent the Supreme Court from hearing claims based on the Bill of Rights , since this can only be done through Constitutional Amendment . Judges and legal analysts have said that if Congress can remove from the judicial branch the ability to determine if legislation is constitutional , the US separation of powers would be disturbed , or rendered non-functional .
