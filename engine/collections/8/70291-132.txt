The Greek peninsula came under Roman rule during the 146 BC conquest of Greece after the Battle of Corinth . Macedonia became a Roman province while southern Greece came under the surveillance of Macedonia 's prefect ; however , some Greek poleis managed to maintain a partial independence and avoid taxation . The Aegean islands were added to this territory in 133 BC . Athens and other Greek cities revolted in 88 BC , and the peninsula was crushed by the Roman general Sulla . The Roman civil wars devastated the land even further , until Augustus organized the peninsula as the province of Achaea in 27 BC .
