The Indianapolis Motor Speedway opened in 1909 , and the first Indianapolis 500 was held in 1911 . It became a tradition that the Indianapolis 500 was the only race held at the track annually . With the exception of a Labor Day race meet in 1916 , no other races were held at the track through 1993 . As the NASCAR Winston Cup Series began to grow in stature and popularity , speculation began to grow in the 1980s and early 1990s about the possibility of holding a race at Indy .
