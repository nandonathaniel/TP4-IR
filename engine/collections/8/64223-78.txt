Pizzolatto narrowed his search for a suitable director to Cary Joji Fukunaga , whom he knew from Anonymous Content , and Alejandro González Iñárritu . Fukunaga was formally appointed as director after Iñárritu pulled out of the project due to film commitments . In preparation for his work on the series , Fukunaga spent time with a homicide detective of the Louisiana State Police 's Criminal Investigations Division to develop an accurate depiction of a 1990s homicide detective 's work . Fukunaga recruited Adam Arkapaw , director of photography of Top of the Lake , as project cinematographer . Arkapaw came to the director 's attention for his work in Animal Kingdom ( 2010 ) and Snowtown ( 2011 ) , and was hired after the two negotiated a deal at a meeting in San Francisco . Alex DiGerlando , who Fukunaga had worked with on Benh Zeitlin 's Glory at Sea in 2008 , was appointed as the production designer . Fukunaga said in an interview , `` I knew what Alex accomplished in the swamps of Louisiana and given some money , how much more amazing he could be in building sets that would just be used for one or two days and be abandoned again .
