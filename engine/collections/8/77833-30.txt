Biorenewable chemicals are chemicals created by biological organisms that provide feedstocks for the chemical industry . Biorenewable chemicals can provide solar - energy - powered substitutes for the petroleum - based carbon feedstocks that currently supply the chemical industry . The tremendous diversity of enzymes in biological organisms , and the potential for synthetic biology to alter these enzymes to create yet new chemical functionalities , can drive the chemical industry . A major platform for creation of new chemicals is the polyketide biosynthetic pathway , which generates chemicals containing repeated alkyl chain units with potential for a wide variety of functional groups at the different carbon atoms .
