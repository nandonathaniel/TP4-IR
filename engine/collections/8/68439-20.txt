Fletcher Davis of Athens , Texas claimed to have invented the hamburger . According to oral histories , in the 1880s he opened a lunch counter in Athens and served a ' burger ' of fried ground beef patties with mustard and Bermuda onion between two slices of bread , with a pickle on the side . The story is that in 1904 , Davis and his wife Ciddy ran a sandwich stand at the St. Louis World 's Fair . Historian Frank X . Tolbert , noted that Athens resident Clint Murchison said his grandfather dated the hamburger to the 1880s with ' Old Dave ' a.k.a. Fletcher Davis . A photo of `` Old Dave 's Hamburger Stand '' from 1904 was sent to Tolbert as evidence of the claim .
