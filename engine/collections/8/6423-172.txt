In August 2009 , the U.S. Disciplinary Barracks at Fort Leavenworth , Kansas , and the Standish Maximum Correctional Facility in Standish , Michigan , were considered as potential sites for transfers of over 220 prisoners . Kansas public officials , including both of its senators and governor , objected to transferring prisoners to the former . Many in Standish , however , welcomed the move to the latter .
