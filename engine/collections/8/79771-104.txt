Regardless of an alternative protocol , some death - penalty opponents have claimed that execution can be less painful by the administration of a single lethal dose of barbiturate . Supporters of the death penalty , however , state that the single - drug theory is a flawed concept . Terminally ill patients in Oregon who have requested physician - assisted suicide have received lethal doses of barbiturates . The protocol has been highly effective in producing a painless death , but the time to cause death can be prolonged . Some patients have taken days to die , and a few patients have actually survived the process and have regained consciousness up to three days after taking the lethal dose . In a California legal proceeding addressing the issue of the lethal injection cocktail being `` cruel and unusual , '' state authorities said that the time to death following a single injection of a barbiturate could be as much as 45 minutes .
