The occupation proved marginally profitable ; the occupying powers received 900 million gold marks , and much of this merely covered the military costs of occupation . However , the real issue behind the occupation was not German defaults on coal and timber deliveries , but the forcing of Germany `` to acknowledge her defeat in World War I and to accept the Versailles Treaty '' . Poincar√© recognized that if Germany could get away with defying Versailles in regard to the reparations , a precedent would be created and inevitably the Germans would proceed to dismantle the rest of the Versailles treaty .
