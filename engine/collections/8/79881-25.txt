On 6 November 2014 , the low - level circulation centre of Qendresa formed near Kerkennah Islands . As the system was moving north - northeastwards and combining with an upper - level low from Tunisia early on 7 November , the system occluded quickly and intensified dramatically with an eye - like feature , thanks to favourable conditions . Qendresa directly hit Malta when it had lost its fronts with a more well - defined eye , with ten - minute sustained winds at 110.9 km / h ( 68.9 mph ) and the gust at 153.7 km / h ( 95.5 mph ) . The central pressure was presumed to be 978 hPa ( 28.88 inHg ) . Interacting with Sicily , the cyclone turned northeastwards and started to make an anticlockwise loop . On 8 November , Qendresa crossed Syracuse in the morning and then significantly weakened . Turning southeastwards then moving eastwards , Qendressa moved over Crete , before dissipating over the island on November 11 .
