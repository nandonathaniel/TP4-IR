`` You are disturbed over Cuba . You say that this disturbs you because it is ninety - nine miles by sea from the coast of the United States of America . But ... you have placed destructive missile weapons , which you call offensive , in Italy and Turkey , literally next to us ... I therefore make this proposal : We are willing to remove from Cuba the means which you regard as offensive ... Your representatives will make a declaration to the effect that the United States ... will remove its analogous means from Turkey ... and after that , persons entrusted by the United Nations Security Council could inspect on the spot the fulfillment of the pledges made .
