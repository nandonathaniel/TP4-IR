The West Coast occasionally experiences ocean - effect showers , usually in the form of rain at lower elevations south of about the mouth of the Columbia River . These occur whenever an Arctic air mass from western Canada is drawn westward out over the Pacific Ocean , typically by way of the Fraser Valley , returning shoreward around a center of low pressure . Cold air flowing southwest from the Fraser Valley can also pick up moisture over the Strait of Georgia and Strait of Juan de Fuca , then rise over the northeastern slopes of the Olympic Mountains , producing heavy , localized snow between Port Angeles and Sequim , as well as areas in Kitsap County and the Puget Sound region .
