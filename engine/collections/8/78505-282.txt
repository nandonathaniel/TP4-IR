At the low altitudes at which the ISS orbits , there is a variety of space debris , consisting of different objects including entire spent rocket stages , defunct satellites , explosion fragments -- including materials from anti-satellite weapon tests , paint flakes , slag from solid rocket motors , and coolant released by US - A nuclear - powered satellites . These objects , in addition to natural micrometeoroids , are a significant threat . Large objects could destroy the station , but are less of a threat because their orbits can be predicted . Objects too small to be detected by optical and radar instruments , from approximately 1 cm down to microscopic size , number in the trillions . Despite their small size , some of these objects are a threat because of their kinetic energy and direction in relation to the station . Spacesuits of spacewalking crew could puncture , causing exposure to vacuum .
