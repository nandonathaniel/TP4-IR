English jurists , writing of legem terrae in reference to the Magna Carta , stated that this term embraces all laws that are in force for the time being within a jurisdiction . For example , Edward Coke , commenting upon Magna Carta , wrote in 1606 : `` no man be taken or imprisoned but per legem terrae , that is , by the common law , statute law , or custom of England . '' In this context , `` custom '' refers only to local custom , because general custom of England was considered part of the common law .
