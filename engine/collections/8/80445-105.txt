Liquid helium below its lambda point ( called helium II ) exhibits very unusual characteristics . Due to its high thermal conductivity , when it boils , it does not bubble but rather evaporates directly from its surface . Helium - 3 also has a superfluid phase , but only at much lower temperatures ; as a result , less is known about the properties of the isotope .
