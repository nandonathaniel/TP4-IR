In an interview with Billboard , Gomez described as a `` one of those tracks that 's addictive because it 's kind of repetitive in the best way . It 's one of those songs that you ca n't get out of your head . '' In an interview with another publication , Gomez explained what she expected from the record : `` This song is fun and I wanted it to be really high fashion and different and I think we have accomplished that . It 's basically talking about how crazy you are about someone whenever it 's the beginning . It 's the honeymoon stage if you will . '' `` Love You like a Love Song '' was released as the second single from When the Sun Goes Down ( 2011 ) , after the international success of `` Who Says '' , on June 17 , 2011 through digital distribution . The song was serviced to contemporary hit radio airplay on August 16 , 2011 in the United States .
