The cooking vessel typically needs to be made of a suitable stainless steel or iron . The increased magnetic permeability of the material decreases the skin depth , concentrating the current near the surface of the metal , and so the electrical resistance will be further increased . Some energy will be dissipated wastefully by the current flowing through the resistance of the coil . To reduce the skin effect and consequent heat generation in the coil , it is made from litz wire , which is a bundle of many smaller insulated wires in parallel . The coil has many turns , while the bottom of the pot effectively forms a single shorted turn . This forms a transformer that steps down the voltage and steps up the current . The resistance of the pot , as viewed from the primary coil , appears larger . In turn , most of the energy becomes heat in the high - resistance steel , while the driving coil stays cool .
