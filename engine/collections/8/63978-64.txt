It is only as a result of accurately maintaining the composition of the 3 litres alveolar air that , with each breath , some carbon dioxide is discharged into the atmosphere and some oxygen is taken up from the outside air . If more carbon dioxide than usual has been lost by a short period of hyperventilation , breathing will be slowed down or halted until the alveolar partial pressure of carbon dioxide has returned to 5.3 kPa ( 40 mmHg ) . The opposite occurs after breath - holding .
