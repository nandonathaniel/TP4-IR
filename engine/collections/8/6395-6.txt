These visual illusions include balls rolling uphill and people leaning farther than normally possible without falling down . Psychologists at Berkeley state that all of the misperceptions stem from the simple fact that the house is slanted at a 20 degree angle . Professor William Prinzmetal states , `` When the perceiver 's body also is tilted , the distorting impact on vision is greatly magnified - up to two or three times . '' Another point he makes is that distorted orientation causes other senses to fall back while your visual senses become heightened . People standing at impossible angles and water flowing uphill are related to the angle at which the house sits on .
