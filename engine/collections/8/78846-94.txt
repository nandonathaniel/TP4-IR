The city became a diverse ethnoburb of a variety of racial and ethnic groups , esp . Blacks , Latinos and Asians replaced the once majority White ( non-Hispanic ) population in the 1990s . Immigrants often come from Central America , Southeast Asia and the Philippines , the Middle East and Somalia , the Balkans , the Caribbean islands ( esp . Cubans and Puerto Ricans ) and Samoans to reestablish themselves in older post-WWII suburban tracts in Sunnymead .
