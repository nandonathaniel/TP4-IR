Political scientists often caution against overinterpreting special election results , which non-experts often take as a bellwether . The evidence suggests that whilst they have some predictive power ( particularly with margin of victory relative to the districts ' normal performance , rather than the win - loss record ) ; other indicators generally provide stronger evidence , and the often small data set of special elections per election cycle makes it worth extrapolating results cautiously . Seats which have changed hands in `` shock '' by - elections also often revert to the former party in the next ( or a subsequent ) general election .
