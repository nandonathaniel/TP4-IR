From a neurobiological perspective , there are three reasons that could cause a person to have hearing loss : either there is something wrong with the mechanical portion of the process , meaning the conductive portions of the ear ( external and middle ear ) , or there is something wrong with the sensory portion of the process ( inner ear or cochlea and related structures ) or there is something wrong with the neural portion of the process , meaning the nerves or brain .
