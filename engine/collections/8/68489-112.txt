In March 2007 comedian Carol Burnett filed a $6 million lawsuit against 20th Century Fox , claiming that her charwoman cartoon character had been portrayed on the show without her permission . She stated it was a trademark infringement , and that Fox violated her publicity rights . On June 4 , 2007 , United States District Judge Dean D. Pregerson rejected the lawsuit , stating that the parody was protected under the First Amendment , citing Hustler Magazine v. Falwell as a precedent .
