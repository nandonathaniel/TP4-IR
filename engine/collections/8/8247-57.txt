In the summer of 2007 , GM Danny Ainge made a series of moves that returned the Celtics to prominence . On draft night , he traded the No. 5 pick Jeff Green , Wally Szczerbiak and Delonte West to Seattle for perennial all - star Ray Allen and Seattle 's second - round pick which the team used to select LSU 's Glen `` Big Baby '' Davis . Then the Celtics traded Ryan Gomes , Gerald Green , Al Jefferson , Theo Ratliff , and Sebastian Telfair to Minnesota , where Ainge 's former teammate Kevin McHale was the G.M. , and swapped 2009 first round draft picks , for MVP Kevin Garnett . These moves created the `` Boston Three Party '' ( the nickname given to describe the combining of Allen , Garnett , and Pierce by Scott Van Pelt in a `` This Is Sportscenter '' commercial ) , which would revitalize the team and lead them back to glory .
