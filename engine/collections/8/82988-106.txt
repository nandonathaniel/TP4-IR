Near the town of Sharpsburg , Lee deployed his available forces behind Antietam Creek along a low ridge , starting on September 15 . While it was an effective defensive position , it was not an impregnable one . The terrain provided excellent cover for infantrymen , with rail and stone fences , outcroppings of limestone , and little hollows and swales . The creek to their front was only a minor barrier , ranging from 60 to 100 feet ( 18 -- 30 m ) in width , and was fordable in places and crossed by three stone bridges each a mile ( 1.5 km ) apart . It was also a precarious position because the Confederate rear was blocked by the Potomac River and only a single crossing point , Boteler 's Ford at Shepherdstown , was nearby should retreat be necessary . ( The ford at Williamsport , Maryland , was 10 miles ( 16 km ) northwest from Sharpsburg and had been used by Jackson in his march to Harpers Ferry . The disposition of Union forces during the battle made it impractical to consider retreating in that direction . ) And on September 15 , the force under Lee 's immediate command consisted of no more than 18,000 men , only a third the size of the Federal army .
