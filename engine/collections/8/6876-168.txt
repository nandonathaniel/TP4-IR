On June 19 , 1862 , Congress prohibited slavery in all current and future United States territories ( though not in the states ) , and President Lincoln quickly signed the legislation . By this act , they repudiated the 1857 opinion of the Supreme Court of the United States in the Dred Scott Case that Congress was powerless to regulate slavery in U.S. territories . This joint action by Congress and President Lincoln also rejected the notion of popular sovereignty that had been advanced by Stephen A. Douglas as a solution to the slavery controversy , while completing the effort first legislatively proposed by Thomas Jefferson in 1784 to confine slavery within the borders of existing states .
