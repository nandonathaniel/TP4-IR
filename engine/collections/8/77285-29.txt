Manchester United 's 26 - year spell without a league title has been mirrored by Liverpool since 1990 , when the Reds clinched their last league title . Meanwhile , United 's dominance since 1990 has seen them win 13 league titles , 23 domestic cups and seven European trophies . Once again , cup glories such as the 2003 League Cup and 2006 FA Cup allowed Liverpool some retribution against their rivals . Despite their contrasting fortunes , though , only six times since 1972 have neither Liverpool nor United finished in the top two of the league table -- in 1980 -- 81 , 2003 -- 04 , 2004 -- 05 , 2014 -- 15 , 2015 -- 16 and 2016 - 17 -- and even during five of those six campaigns , another piece of silverware was still taken home by one of the two clubs ; Liverpool paraded the European Cup and League Cup in 1981 , while Manchester United lifted the FA Community Shield and FA Cup in the 2004 season and Liverpool claimed the Champions League in 2005 . United brought home the FA Cup again in 2016 and they won a treble of trophies consisting of the Community Shield , League Cup and UEFA Europa League in 2016 - 17 .
