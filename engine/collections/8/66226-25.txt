Other tasks have been developed to try to solve the problems inherent in the false - belief task . In the `` Unexpected contents '' , or `` Smarties '' task , experimenters ask children what they believe to be the contents of a box that looks as though it holds a candy called `` Smarties '' . After the child guesses ( usually ) `` Smarties '' , it is shown that the box in fact contained pencils . The experimenter then re-closes the box and asks the child what she thinks another person , who has not been shown the true contents of the box , will think is inside . The child passes the task if he / she responds that another person will think that `` Smarties '' exist in the box , but fails the task if she responds that another person will think that the box contains pencils . Gopnik & Astington ( 1988 ) found that children pass this test at age four or five years .
