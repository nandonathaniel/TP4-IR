Forgotten man is a phrase with several meanings , some of which are polar opposites . It was first used by William Graham Sumner in an 1883 lecture in Brooklyn entitled The Forgotten Man ( published posthumously in 1918 ) to refer to the person compelled to pay for reformist programs ; however , since Franklin Roosevelt appropriated the phrase in a 1932 speech , it has more often been used to refer to those at the bottom of the economic government whom the state ( in Roosevelt 's view and in the general social humanitarian approach ) needed to help .
