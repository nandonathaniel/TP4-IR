Interferon type I : All type I IFNs bind to a specific cell surface receptor complex known as the IFN - α / β receptor ( IFNAR ) that consists of IFNAR1 and IFNAR2 chains . The type I interferons present in humans are IFN - α , IFN - β , IFN - ε , IFN - κ and IFN - ω . In general , type I interferons are produced when the body recognizes a virus has invaded it . They are produced by fibroblasts and monocytes . However , the production of type I IFN - α is prohibited by another cytokine known as Interleukin - 10 . Once released , type I interferons will activate molecules which prevent the virus from producing and replicating its RNA and DNA . Overall , IFN - α can be used to treat hepatitis B and C infections , while IFN - β can be used to treat multiple sclerosis .
