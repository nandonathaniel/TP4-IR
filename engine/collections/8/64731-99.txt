Eventually , it 's time for the rappers to begin their final challenge : to not only write an entire song ( verses , chorus , hook ) , but to also write a 16 - bar verse and be prepared to perform both of them . They are both given CDs of beats and sent to create . The next day , Serch brings a gift for the two -- close friends of $ hamrock and John Brown are invited to hang out with them for a while . While $ hamrock is excited to see his friend , Black Josh , whom $ hamrock credits for getting him to actually get out and rap in public , John Brown is less - than excited by his guest , Blaise Delacroix II , who is n't even a member of his `` Ghetto Revival '' crew . John Brown also says that he is only focused on the task at hand , and has no time for visitors at the time . Eventually , the guests leave , and it 's only John Brown and $ hamrock left to finish their preparations .
