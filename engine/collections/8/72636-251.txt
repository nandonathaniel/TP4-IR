The government 's fire safety tests were criticised for looking only at the cladding and not the insulation behind it , which had burned rapidly in the Grenfell Tower fire ; testing the insulation is left to councils and landlords . By 6 July , only one of 191 samples tested had passed . It was announced that large - scale tests were to be done on a 9 - metre ( 30 ft ) high wall , simulating a fire breaking out of a window .
