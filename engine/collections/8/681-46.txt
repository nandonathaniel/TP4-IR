Nichols ' second printing is a scarce and handsome edition , the first to include the illustrations by Letchford . In 1896 , two years after their first edition of Burton 's Nights , the Nichols - Smithers duo commissioned Burton 's close friend , Albert Letchford , to paint 65 illustrations for another edition as well as a portrait of Burton , and soon after commissioned for five more . Burton and Letchford had met several years before when the latter was 18 and in Florence beginning his art education . They discussed the possibility of illustrating the Nights . Burton 's suggestion of illustrating the Nights had appealed greatly to Letchford on account of the unlimited scope such a subject would give to an artist who loved the East and had a boundless imagination . Letchford commenced study of Eastern images for his paintings , though only one of the illustrations was painted in Burton 's lifetime .
