Several world records that were once included in the book have been removed for ethical reasons , including concerns for the well being of potential record breakers . For example , following publication of a `` heaviest fish '' record , many fish owners overfed their pets beyond the bounds of what was healthy , and therefore such entries were removed . The Guinness Book also dropped records within their `` eating and drinking records '' section of Human Achievements in 1991 over concerns that potential competitors could harm themselves and expose the publisher to potential litigation . These changes included the removal of all spirit , wine , and beer drinking records , along with other unusual records for consuming such unlikely things as bicycles and trees . Other records , such as sword swallowing and rally driving ( on public roads ) , were closed from further entry as the current holders had performed beyond what are considered safe human tolerance levels .
