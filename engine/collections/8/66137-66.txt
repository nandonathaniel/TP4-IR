Industrial Light & Magic ( ILM ) produced the film 's visual effects . ILM used CGI and digitally altered archive footage to insert Peter Cushing 's likeness over the body of actor Guy Henry . Lucasfilm secured permission from the late actor 's estate to include him in the film . The team reportedly searched through countless hours of Cushing footage in order to find suitable material to build from , then Henry provided the motion capture and voice work with the reference material augmented and mapped over his performance like a digital body mask . Cushing 's family were heavily involved with the creation and had input right down to `` small , subtle adjustments '' . Cushing 's mannerisms , including his manner of speaking and facial tics , were studied by the visual effects artists and applied to the digital Tarkin . A similar process was used in the portrayal of Princess Leia ; Carrie Fisher 's appearance as Leia in the first film was superimposed over Norwegian actress Ingvild Deila 's face and archival audio of Fisher saying `` Hope '' was used to voice the character .
