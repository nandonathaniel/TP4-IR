The advent of single - molecule studies led in the 2010s to the observation that the movement of untethered enzymes increases with increasing substrate concentration and increasing reaction enthalpy . Subsequent observations suggest that this increase in diffusivity is driven by transient displacement of the enzyme 's center of mass , resulting in a `` recoil effect that propels the enzyme '' .
