Because the North Korean NOC failed to enter their only qualified athletes to the Games , its participation remained uncertain . The North Korean spot went to the runners up , Sumire Suto and Francis Boudreau - Audet representing Japan . They needed to accept the spot by 21 December , which did not happen . North Korea could have still requested its quota to be confirmed , in which case the IOC would have deliberated on the matter . `` ( W ) e would of course be flexible if they expressed a desire to come '' , an IOC spokesperson has said . A wild card option remained on the table .
