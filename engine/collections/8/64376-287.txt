The museum in the film Night at the Museum ( 2006 ) is based on a 1993 book that was set at the AMNH ( The Night at the Museum ) . The interior scenes were shot at a sound stage in Vancouver , British Columbia , but exterior shots of the museum 's fa√ßade were done at the actual AMNH . AMNH officials have credited the movie with increasing the number of visitors during the holiday season in 2006 by almost 20 percent . According to museum president Ellen Futter , there were 50,000 more visits over the previous year during the 2006 holiday season . Its sequels , Night at the Museum : Battle of the Smithsonian ( 2009 ) and Night at the Museum : Secret of the Tomb ( 2014 ) , were also partially set in this museum .
