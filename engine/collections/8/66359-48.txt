It was during the Sui and Tang dynasties that China expanded into eastern Central Asia . Chinese foreign policy to the north and west now had to deal with Turkic nomads , who were becoming the most dominant ethnic group in Central Asia . To handle and avoid any threats posed by the Turks , the Sui government repaired fortifications and received their trade and tribute missions . They sent royal princesses off to marry Turkic clan leaders , a total of four of them in 597 , 599 , 614 , and 617 . The Sui stirred trouble and conflict amongst ethnic groups against the Turks .
