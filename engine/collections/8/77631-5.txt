Typically unconscious , transference is when the patient allows past experiences to affect present relationships . In therapy , this may come about if the therapist reminds the patient , either consciously or unconsciously , of someone in their past who may have had an early impact on their life . Subsequently , the patient may suddenly tend to regard the therapist in either a positive or negative manner , depending upon the nature of the past influence .
