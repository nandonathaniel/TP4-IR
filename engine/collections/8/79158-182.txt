Schottenhamel -- Reckoned to be the most important tent at the Oktoberfest , mainly because it is located at the beginning . On the first Saturday of the event , no beer is allowed to be served until the Mayor of Munich ( currently Dieter Reiter ) taps the first keg , at exactly high noon . Only then can the other tents begin to serve beer . The tent is very popular among younger people . A substantial part of the tent is guaranteed to traditional Studentenverbindungen ( a particular form of student fraternities ) and outfitted with their distinctive colors and coats of arms .
