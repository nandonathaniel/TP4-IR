Despite being non-justiciable , the Directive Principles act as a check on the state ; theorised as a yardstick in the hands of the electorate and the opposition to measure the performance of a government at the time of an election . Article 37 , while stating that the Directive Principles are not enforceable in any court of law , declares them to be `` fundamental to the governance of the country '' and imposes an obligation on the State to apply them in matters of legislation . Thus , they serve to emphasise the welfare state model of the Constitution and emphasise the positive duty of the state to promote the welfare of the people by affirming social , economic and political justice , as well as to fight income inequality and ensure individual dignity , as mandated by Article 38 .
