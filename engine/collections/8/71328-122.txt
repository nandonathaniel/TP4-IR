Alaska also used eight Boeing 737 - 200 Combi / QCs to suit the unique needs of flying in the state of Alaska . These aircraft were valued for their ability to be rapidly reconfigured ( hence the moniker QC or `` Quick Change '' ) to match the specific cargo and passenger loads for any given flight . In the all - freight configuration , the 737 - 200 Combis carried up to six cargo containers , known as `` igloos . '' The palletized floor allowed for passenger seating to range from 26 to 72 seats . The 737 - 200s were also gravel - kitted , which allowed them to be used at airports such as Red Dog , which formerly featured a gravel runway . Alaska replaced the 737 - 200s with six reconfigured 737 - 400s between 2006 and 2007 . Five feature a mixed cargo / passenger `` Combi '' arrangement , and one is a `` freighter '' carrying only cargo . Unlike the 737 - 200 Combi , the 737 - 400 Combis feature a fixed seating capacity of 72 seats . The last 737 - 200 Combi ( short for combination ) was retired in 2007 and is now displayed at the Alaska Aviation Museum .
