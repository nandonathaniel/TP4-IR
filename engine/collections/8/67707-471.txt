The Latin verb ferre is irregular , and not a good representative of a normal thematic verb . In most Romance Languages such as French , other verbs now mean `` to carry '' ( e.g. Fr . porter < Lat . portare ) and ferre only survives in compounds such as souffrir `` to suffer '' ( from Latin sub - and ferre ) and conférer `` to confer '' ( from Latin `` con - '' and `` ferre '' ) . However , Sardinian still retains a reflex of ferre in the verb fèrrere .
