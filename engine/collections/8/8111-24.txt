When Columbus took possession of the island in 1492 , he named it Insula Hispana in Latin and La Isla Española in Spanish , with both meaning `` the Spanish island '' . De las Casas shortened the name to `` Española '' , and when d'Anghiera detailed his account of the island in Latin , he rendered its name as Hispaniola . In the oldest documented map of the island , created by Andrés de Morales , Los Haitises is labeled Montes de Haití ( `` Haiti Mountains '' ) , and de las Casas apparently named the whole island Haiti on the basis of that particular region , as d'Anghiera states that the name of one part was given to the whole island .
