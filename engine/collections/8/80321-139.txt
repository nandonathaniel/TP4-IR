Six seasons can be distinguished which do not have fixed calendar - based dates like the meteorological and astronomical seasons . Oceanic regions tend to experience the beginning of the hibernal season up to a month later than continental climates . Conversely , prevernal and vernal seasons begin up to a month earlier near oceanic and coastal areas . For example , prevernal crocus blooms typically appear as early as February in coastal areas of British Columbia , the British Isles , but generally do n't appear until March or April in locations like the Midwest USA or parts of eastern Europe . The actual dates for each season vary by climate region and can shift from one year to the next . Average dates listed here are for mild and cool temperate climate zones in the Northern Hemisphere :
