In articulatory phonetics , the manner of articulation is the configuration and interaction of the articulators ( speech organs such as the tongue , lips , and palate ) when making a speech sound . One parameter of manner is stricture , that is , how closely the speech organs approach one another . Others include those involved in the r - like sounds ( taps and trills ) , and the sibilancy of fricatives .
