Revision 1.0 a was released on January 7 , 2003 . First - generation SATA interfaces , now known as SATA 1.5 Gbit / s , communicate at a rate of 1.5 Gbit / s , and do not support Native Command Queuing ( NCQ ) . Taking 8b / 10b encoding overhead into account , they have an actual uncoded transfer rate of 1.2 Gbit / s ( 150 MB / s ) . The theoretical burst throughput of SATA 1.5 Gbit / s is similar to that of PATA / 133 , but newer SATA devices offer enhancements such as NCQ , which improve performance in a multitasking environment .
