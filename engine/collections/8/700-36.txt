Calvin is the third oldest of Paddy and Branwen O'Keefe's eleven children , a tall , thin , red - haired 14 - year - old high school junior who is not the best in math but has to study to play on the school basketball team , and is one of the popular boys in high school . His mother is a very cranky , tired woman with too many children . Neglected by his own family , Calvin enters the lives of the Murry family , starting in Chapter Two . He also loves Meg Murry . He shows some signs of being able to communicate telepathically , the same power Charles Wallace seems to have , a technique referred to in later books as kything . He also feels as if he has been hiding his true self all his life , and likes the Murry family much more than his own , which is characterized by abuse and dysfunctional dynamics .
