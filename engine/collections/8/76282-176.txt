The U.S. Secret Service is charged with protecting the sitting president and the first family . As part of their protection , presidents , first ladies , their children and other immediate family members , and other prominent persons and locations are assigned Secret Service codenames . The use of such names was originally for security purposes and dates to a time when sensitive electronic communications were not routinely encrypted ; today , the names simply serve for purposes of brevity , clarity , and tradition .
