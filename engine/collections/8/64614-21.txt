The ozone layer can be depleted by free radical catalysts , including nitric oxide ( NO ) , nitrous oxide ( N O ) , hydroxyl ( OH ) , atomic chlorine ( Cl ) , and atomic bromine ( Br ) . While there are natural sources for all of these species , the concentrations of chlorine and bromine increased markedly in recent decades because of the release of large quantities of man - made organohalogen compounds , especially chlorofluorocarbons ( CFCs ) and bromofluorocarbons . These highly stable compounds are capable of surviving the rise to the stratosphere , where Cl and Br radicals are liberated by the action of ultraviolet light . Each radical is then free to initiate and catalyze a chain reaction capable of breaking down over 100,000 ozone molecules . By 2009 , nitrous oxide was the largest ozone - depleting substance ( ODS ) emitted through human activities .
