Salmon populations declined dramatically after the establishment of canneries in 1867 . In 1879 it was reported that 545,450 salmon , with an average weight of 22 pounds ( 10.0 kg ) were caught ( in a recent season ) and mainly canned for export to England . A can weighing 1 pound ( 0.45 kg ) could be sold for 8d or 9d . By 1908 , there was widespread concern about the decline of salmon and sturgeon . In that year , the people of Oregon passed two laws under their newly instituted program of citizens ' initiatives limiting fishing on the Columbia and other rivers . Then in 1948 , another initiative banned the use of seine nets ( devices already used by Native Americans , and refined by later settlers ) altogether .
