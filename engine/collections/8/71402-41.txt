Lurie 's choice to replace Kotite was San Francisco 49ers Defensive Coordinator Ray Rhodes , who successfully lobbied 49ers star Ricky Watters to join the team as a free agent . In 1995 , Rhodes 's first season , the Eagles got off to a slow start by losing 3 out their first 4 games : they subsequently rebounded , finishing with a 10 - 6 record and a playoff spot . In the Wild Card Round , the Eagles played at home and overwhelmed the Detroit Lions 58 - 37 , with 31 of Philadelphia 's points coming in the second quarter alone . Despite this dominating performance , yet again , the Eagles were eliminated in the next round by the Cowboys ( 30 - 11 ) . Ironically , this would be Randall Cunningham 's last game as an Eagle . Cunningham would score the only touchdown of the game and the last Eagles post season touchdown for six years .
