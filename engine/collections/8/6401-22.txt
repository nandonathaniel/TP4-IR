In the spring of 1984 , an arm of the United States Navy asked some of its civilian researchers to assess statistical process control and the work of several prominent quality consultants and to make recommendations as to how to apply their approaches to improve the Navy 's operational effectiveness . The recommendation was to adopt the teachings of W. Edwards Deming . The Navy branded the effort `` Total Quality Management '' in 1985 .
