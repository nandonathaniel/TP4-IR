The first demonstration of the instantaneous transmission of images was by Georges Rignoux and A. Fournier in Paris in 1909 . A matrix of 64 selenium cells , individually wired to a mechanical commutator , served as an electronic retina . In the receiver , a type of Kerr cell modulated the light and a series of variously angled mirrors attached to the edge of a rotating disc scanned the modulated beam onto the display screen . A separate circuit regulated synchronization . The 8x8 pixel resolution in this proof - of - concept demonstration was just sufficient to clearly transmit individual letters of the alphabet . An updated image was transmitted `` several times '' each second .
