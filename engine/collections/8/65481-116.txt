The partner bond in corvids is extremely strong and even lifelong in some species . This monogamous lifestyle , however , can still contain extra-pair copulations . Males and females build large nests together in trees or on ledges . The male will also feed the female during incubation . The nests are constructed of a mass of bulky twigs lined with grass and bark . Corvids can lay between 3 and 10 eggs , typically ranging between 4 and 7 . The eggs are usually greenish in colour with brown blotches . Once hatched , the young remain in the nests for up to 6 -- 10 weeks depending on the species . Corvids provide biparental care .
