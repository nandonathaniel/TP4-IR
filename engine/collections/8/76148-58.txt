Just north of the village on St. Simons Island off Mallery Street is a park of oak trees named St. Simons Park . On the southern edge of the oaks , along a narrow lane , is a low earthen mound where 30 Native Americans are buried . The men , women and children interred there lived in a settlement on the site two centuries before the first European contact .
