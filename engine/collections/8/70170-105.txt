On November 1 , 1983 , a day after the death of George Halas , his oldest daughter , Virginia McCaskey , took over as the majority owner of the team . Her husband , Ed McCaskey , succeeded her father as the Chairman of the Board . Their son Michael became the third president in team history . Mrs. McCaskey holds the honorary title of `` secretary of the board of directors '' , but the 90 - year -- old matriarch has been called the glue that holds the franchise together . Mrs. McCaskey 's reign as the owner of the Bears was not planned , as her father originally earmarked her brother , George `` Mugs '' Halas Jr. as the heir apparent to the franchise . However , he died of a massive heart attack in 1979 . Her impact on the team is well - noted as her own family has dubbed her `` The First Lady of Sports '' , and the Chicago Sun - Times has listed her as one of Chicago 's most powerful women .
