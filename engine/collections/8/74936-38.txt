Cranial nerves are numbered based on their rostral - caudal ( front - back ) position , when viewing the brain . If the brain is carefully removed from the skull the nerves are typically visible in their numeric order , with the exception of the last , CN XII , which appears to emerge rostrally to ( above ) CN XI .
