After the negotiations to amend Article 136 succeeded in March 2011 , the leaders of the EU came to an agreement on a permanent stability fund for the eurozone called the European Stability Mechanism on 11 July 2011 . It was decided that the ESM would have a size of 500 billion euros , by replacing the non-permanent European Financial Stability Fund and the European Financial Stability Mechanism . However , as the European sovereign debt crisis worsened , the leaders decided not to ratify the treaty as they planned several changes in the ESM , thus scrapping the original concept . The subsequent version of the ESM treaty was signed on 2 February 2012 .
