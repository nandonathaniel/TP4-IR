The third barrier is the bacteriostatic effect locally activated when the surface reaches pH values less than 3 - 4 . At this level , the alumina gel is no longer stable and will dissolve , liberating aluminum ions . These ions will accumulate in the thin biofilm . Once the concentration reaches 300 - 500 ppm , it will produce a bacteriostatic effect on bacteria metabolism . In other word , bacteria will stop oxidizing the sulfur from H S to produce acid , and the pH will stop decreasing .
