Fisheye lenses , typical focal lengths are between 8 mm and 10 mm for circular images , and 15 -- 16 mm for full - frame images . Up to 180 Â° and beyond . A circular fisheye lens ( as opposed to a full - frame fisheye ) is an example of a lens where the angle of coverage is less than the angle of view . The image projected onto the film is circular because the diameter of the image projected is narrower than that needed to cover the widest portion of the film .
