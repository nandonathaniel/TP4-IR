The tracks are numbered according to their location in the terminal building . The upper - level tracks are numbered 11 to 42 east to west . Tracks 22 and 31 were removed in the late 1990s to build concourses for Grand Central North . Track 12 was removed to expand the platform between tracks 11 and 13 and track 14 is only used for loading a garbage train . The lower level has 27 tracks , numbered 100 to 126 , east to west ; currently , only tracks 102 -- 112 , and 114 -- 116 are used for passenger service . Odd - numbered tracks are usually on the east side ( right side facing north ) of the platform ; even - numbered tracks on the west .
