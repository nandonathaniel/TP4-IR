Most fossil insect groups found after the Permian -- Triassic boundary differ significantly from those before . Of Paleozoic insect groups , only the Glosselytrodea , Miomoptera , and Protorthoptera have been discovered in deposits from after the extinction . The caloneurodeans , monurans , paleodictyopteroids , protelytropterans , and protodonates became extinct by the end of the Permian . In well - documented Late Triassic deposits , fossils overwhelmingly consist of modern fossil insect groups .
