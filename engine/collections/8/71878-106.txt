As one consequence , workplace democracy ( sometimes referred to as Workers ' self - management ) has become both more common and advocated to a greater extent , in some places distributing all management functions among workers , each of whom takes on a portion of the work . However , these models predate any current political issue , and may occur more naturally than does a command hierarchy . All management embraces to some degree a democratic principle -- in that in the long term , the majority of workers must support management . Otherwise , they leave to find other work or go on strike . Despite the move toward workplace democracy , command - and - control organization structures remain commonplace as de facto organization structure . Indeed , the entrenched nature of command - and - control is evident in the way that recent layoffs have been conducted with management ranks affected far less than employees at the lower levels . In some cases , management has even rewarded itself with bonuses after laying off lower - level workers .
