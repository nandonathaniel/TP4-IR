Many of the Pinky and the Brain episodes occur in the 1990s at Acme Labs , located in some large American city underneath a suspension bridge . Several episodes take place in historical times , with Pinky and the Brain in the laboratory of some scientifically - minded person , including Merlin , H.G. Wells , and Ivan Pavlov . There is very little continuity between episodes outside of the common fixtures of the mice , though some plans for world domination from early episodes are subsequently referred to in later seasons ( for example , Brain 's `` human suit '' used in `` Win Big '' reappears when Brain faces his rival Snowball in `` Snowball '' ) .
