In November 2001 , Major League Baseball 's owners voted 28 -- 2 to contract the league by two teams -- according to various sources , the Expos and the Minnesota Twins , both of which reportedly voted against contraction . Subsequently , the Boston Red Sox were sold to a partnership led by John W. Henry , owner of the Florida Marlins . In order to clear the way for Henry 's group to assume ownership of the Red Sox , Henry sold the Marlins to Loria , and baseball purchased the Expos from Loria . However , the Metropolitan Sports Facilities Commission , operator of the Metrodome , won an injunction requiring the Twins to play there in 2002 . Because MLB was unable to revoke the Twins franchise , it was compelled to keep both the Twins and Expos as part of the regular season schedule . In the collective bargaining agreement signed with the Major League Baseball Players Association ( MLBPA ) in August 2002 , contraction was prohibited until the end of the contract in 2006 . By that time , the Expos had become the Washington Nationals and the Twins had made sufficient progress towards the eventual building of a new baseball - specific stadium that contraction was no longer on the agenda .
