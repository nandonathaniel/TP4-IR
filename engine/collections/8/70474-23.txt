Young saltwater crocodiles are pale yellow in colour with black stripes and spots on their bodies and tails . This colouration lasts for several years until the crocodiles mature into adults . The colour as an adult is much darker greenish - drab , with a few lighter tan or grey areas sometimes apparent . Several colour variations are known and some adults may retain fairly pale skin , whereas others may be so dark as to appear blackish . The ventral surface is white or yellow in colour on saltwater crocodiles of all ages . Stripes are present on the lower sides of their bodies , but do not extend onto their bellies . Their tails are grey with dark bands .
