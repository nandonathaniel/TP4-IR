The New Testament writings about the crucifixion of Jesus do not speak specifically about the shape of that cross , but the early writings that do speak of its shape , from about the year AD 100 on , describe it as shaped like the letter T ( the Greek letter tau ) or as composed of an upright and a transverse beam , sometimes with a small projection in the upright .
