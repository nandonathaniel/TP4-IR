The Greek Fathers accepted the traditional belief in the evil eye , but attributed it to the Devil and envy . In Greek theology , the evil eye or vaskania ( βασκανία ) is considered harmful for the one whose envy inflicts it on others as well as for the sufferer . The Greek Church has an ancient prayer against vaskania from the Megan Hieron Synekdemon ( Μέγαν Ιερόν Συνέκδημον ) book of prayers .
