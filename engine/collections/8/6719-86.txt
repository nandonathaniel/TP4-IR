Osmium has a blue - gray tint and is the densest stable element , approximately twice the density of lead and slightly denser than iridium . Calculations of density from the X-ray diffraction data may produce the most reliable data for these elements , giving a value of 7004225620000000000 ♠ 22.562 ± 0.009 g / cm for iridium versus 7004225870000000000 ♠ 22.587 ± 0.009 g / cm for osmium .
