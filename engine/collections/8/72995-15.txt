Eight of the nine stadiums in the Canadian Football League currently use artificial turf . The only one that does not is BMO Field in Toronto , which initially had an artificial pitch and is shared by the CFL 's Toronto Argonauts ( however , part of the endzones at that stadium are covered with artificial turf ) .
