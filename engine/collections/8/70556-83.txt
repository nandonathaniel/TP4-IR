The IHPVA hour record is 90.60 km ( 56.30 mi ) , set by Sam Whittingham on 19 July 2009 . The equivalent record for an upright bicycle is 54.526 km ( 33.881 mi ) , set by Bradley Wiggins in 2015 . The UCI no longer considers the bike Chris Boardman rode for his 1996 record to be in compliance with its definition of an upright bicycle . Boardman 's Monocoque bike was designed by Mike Burrows , whose Windcheetah recumbent trike ( see above ) also holds the record from Land 's End to John o ' Groats , 861 miles ( 1,386 km ) in 41 h 4 min 22 s with Andy Wilkinson riding .
