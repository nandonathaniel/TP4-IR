Hill was particularly busy in the so - called `` Golden Age '' of live TV drama , appearing in such offerings as The Trial of Sacco and Vanzetti in 1960 , where he portrayed Bartolomeo Vanzetti . `` When I first became an actor , there were two young actors in New York : Marlon Brando and Steven Hill , '' said Martin Landau , who later became Hill 's castmate in the first season of Mission : Impossible . Landau went on to admit , `` A lot of people said that Steven would have been the one , not Marlon . He was legendary . Nuts , volatile , mad , and his work was exciting . ''
