Isolating materials that might be harmful or a threat to the cell Containing waste products Containing water in plant cells Maintaining internal hydrostatic pressure or turgor within the cell Maintaining an acidic internal pH Containing small molecules Exporting unwanted substances from the cell Allows plants to support structures such as leaves and flowers due to the pressure of the central vacuole By increasing in size , allows the germinating plant or its organs ( such as leaves ) to grow very quickly and using up mostly just water . In seeds , stored proteins needed for germination are kept in ' protein bodies ' , which are modified vacuoles .
