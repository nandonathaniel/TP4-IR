During surgeries in and around the eye , such as corneal transplant surgery , the patient often requires injection of a local anesthetic into the eye . In patients who show the photic sneeze reflex , an injection into the eye , such as that undergone in a retrobulbar or peribulbar block , can often elicit a sneeze from the patient . During these procedures , the patient may be sedated prior to the periocular injection . The patient begins to sneeze just as the needle is inserted into the eye , often resulting in the anesthesiologist having to remove the needle before injecting the local anesthetic in order to avoid damaging the patient 's eye .
