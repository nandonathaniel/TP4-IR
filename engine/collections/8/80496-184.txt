Written in the first person , the poem tells of Dante 's journey through the three realms of the dead , lasting from the night before Good Friday to the Wednesday after Easter in the spring of 1300 . The Roman poet Virgil guides him through Hell and Purgatory ; Beatrice , Dante 's ideal woman , guides him through Heaven . Beatrice was a Florentine woman whom he had met in childhood and admired from afar in the mode of the then - fashionable courtly love tradition , which is highlighted in Dante 's earlier work La Vita Nuova .
