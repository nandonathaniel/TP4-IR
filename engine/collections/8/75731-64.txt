Many legislators hold the view that separation of powers means that powers are shared among different branches ; no one branch may act unilaterally on issues ( other than perhaps minor questions ) , but must obtain some form of agreement across branches . That is , it is argued that `` checks and balances '' apply to the Judicial branch as well as to the other branches -- for example , in the regulation of attorneys and judges , and the establishment by Congress of rules for the conduct of federal courts , and by state legislatures for state courts . Although in practice these matters are delegated to the Supreme Court , the Congress holds these powers and delegates them to the Supreme Court only for convenience in light of the Supreme Court 's expertise , but can withdraw that delegation at any time .
