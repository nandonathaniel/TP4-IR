When the city 's Board of Education began building the John Phillip Sousa Junior High , a group of parents from the Anacostia neighborhood petitioned to have the school admit black and white students . When it was constructed , the board declared that only whites could enroll . The parents sued in a case decided in the landmark Supreme Court ruling Bolling v. Sharpe . Partly due to the District 's unique status under the Constitution , the court decided unanimously that all of D.C. 's public schools had to be integrated . In the wake of this and the landmark 1954 Supreme Court case Brown v. Board of Education , the Eisenhower administration decided to make D.C. schools the first to integrate , as an example to the rest of the nation .
