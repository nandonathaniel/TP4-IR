By the time of Byron and Sir Walter Scott , effective copyright laws existed , at least in England , and many authors depended heavily on their income from their large royalties . America remained a zone of piracy until the mid-nineteenth century , a fact of which Charles Dickens and Mark Twain bitterly complained . By the middle of the 19th century , a situation akin to modern publication had emerged , where most bestsellers were written for a popular taste and are now almost entirely forgotten , with odd exceptions such as East Lynne ( remembered only for the line `` Gone , gone , and never called me mother ! '' ) , the wildly popular Uncle Tom 's Cabin , and Sherlock Holmes .
