This stage is also known as Deliberation Day . After the auditions , the judges have to whittle the successful acts down to the semi-finalists . Series 1 had 24 semi-finalists , which increased to 40 semi-finalists for the next four series and again to 45 semi-finalists from series 6 before returning to 40 for series 11 . The performers are called back to discover if they have progressed to the live semi-finals . During series 5 , some acts were asked to perform again as the judges were having difficulty coming to a final decision on whom to send through to the semi-finals . This was the first and only time this had happened in the history of the show .
