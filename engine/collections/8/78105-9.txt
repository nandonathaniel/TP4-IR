The evangelical movement inside and outside the Church of England gained strength in the late 18th and early 19th century . The movement challenge the traditional religious sensibility that emphasized a code of honor for the upper - class , and suitable behaviour for everyone else , together with faithful observances of rituals . John Wesley ( 1703 -- 1791 ) and his followers preached revivalist religion , trying to convert individuals to a personal relationship with Christ through Bible reading , regular prayer , and especially the revival experience . Wesley himself preached 52,000 times , calling on men and women to `` redeem the time '' and save their souls . Wesley always operated inside the Church of England , but at his death , it set up outside institutions that became the Methodist Church . It stood alongside the traditional nonconformist churches , Presbyterians , Congregationalist , Baptists , Unitarians and Quakers . The nonconformist churches , however , were less influenced by revivalism .
