In the later years of Gustafson 's tenure , two - time All - America quarterback George Mira guided the Hurricanes to berths in the 1961 Liberty Bowl and the 1962 Gotham Bowl , where they lost both games . In 1963 , the team struggled to a 3 -- 7 record . Nevertheless , Mira , who set many of the school 's passing records during his four years at Miami , appeared on the cover of Sports Illustrated and finished fifth in the Heisman Trophy voting as a senior . Following the season , Gustafson decided to step down as head coach and Charlie Tate , an assistant at Georgia Tech , was hired to replace him . Gustafson has the Hurricane record for most years as head coach ( 16 ) and most wins as well ( 93 ) .
