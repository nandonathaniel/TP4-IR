Five of the Original Six teams ( excluding the Boston Bruins ) as well as the New Jersey Devils kept their previous styles intact when possible , with the Devils going as far as to issue a press release saying that the team had no plans for an event unveiling the Rbk Edge design , because there was nothing new to see . The Anaheim Ducks and Buffalo Sabres , who both had just redesigned their sweaters the year before the implementation of the Edge sweaters , also left theirs mostly unchanged . But the Sabres made the logo on the front of their sweater smaller and took away the silver outline on their white away sweater , and the Ducks added orange piping to their sweater 's neckline .
