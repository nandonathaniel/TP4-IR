A third gender or third sex is a concept in which individuals are categorized , either by themselves or by society , as neither men nor women . It also describes a social category present in those societies that recognize three or more genders . The concepts of `` third '' , `` fourth '' , and `` some '' gender roles , which differ from that culture 's two main roles of `` man '' and `` woman '' , while found in a number of non-Western cultures , is still somewhat new to mainstream Western culture and can be difficult for some to understand within traditional Western conceptual thought .
