Kuhn ( 1961 ) said the scientist generally has a theory in mind before designing and undertaking experiments so as to make empirical observations , and that the `` route from theory to measurement can almost never be traveled backward '' . This implies that the way in which theory is tested is dictated by the nature of the theory itself , which led Kuhn ( 1961 , p. 166 ) to argue that `` once it has been adopted by a profession ... no theory is recognized to be testable by any quantitative tests that it has not already passed '' .
