Law & Order : Special Victims Unit originally centered almost exclusively on the detectives of the Special Victims Unit in a fictional version of the 16th Precinct of the New York City Police Department . As the series progressed , additional supporting characters were added as allies of the detectives in the New York County Manhattan District Attorney 's office ( known as advisers from the Sex Crimes Bureau ) and the Medical Examiner 's office . Certain episodes will go into detail about detectives ' personal lives and how they may or may not tie into the crimes dealt with during the show . Typical episodes follow the detectives and their colleagues as they investigate and prosecute sexually based offenses , child abuse , and crimes against the elderly . The show starred Christopher Meloni as Detective Elliot Stabler and Mariska Hargitay as Detective Olivia Benson for its first twelve seasons until the former left the cast , unable to come to an agreement on his contract .
