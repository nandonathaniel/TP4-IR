The group established a routine of recording during the week and playing tourist on the weekends . Paul temporarily joined a local country club , where he would spend most mornings . The band would be driven to the studio in the early afternoon where recording would last into the late evening and sometimes early morning . To make up for the departed band members , Paul would play drums and lead guitar parts with Denny playing rhythm guitar and Linda adding keyboards . The first track they recorded at Apapa was `` Mamunia '' , the title for which McCartney appropriated from the name of a hotel in Marrakesh where Wings had stayed in April 1973 .
