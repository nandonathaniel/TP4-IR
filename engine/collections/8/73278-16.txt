In 1775 , a man flags down the nightly mail - coach on its route from London to Dover . The man is Jerry Cruncher , an employee of Tellson 's Bank in London ; he carries a message for Jarvis Lorry , a passenger and one of the bank 's managers . Mr. Lorry sends Jerry back to deliver a cryptic response to the bank : `` Recalled to Life . '' The message refers to Alexandre Manette , a French physician who has been released from the Bastille after an 18 - year imprisonment . Once Mr. Lorry arrives in Dover , he meets with Dr. Manette 's daughter Lucie and her governess , Miss Pross . Lucie has believed her father to be dead , and faints at the news that he is alive ; Mr. Lorry takes her to France to reunite with him .
