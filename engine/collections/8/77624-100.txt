Over time , social strictures regarding racial segregation began to relax in America : white bandleaders began to recruit black musicians and black bandleaders white ones . In the mid-1930s , Benny Goodman hired pianist Teddy Wilson , vibraphonist Lionel Hampton and guitarist Charlie Christian to join small groups . In the 1930s , Kansas City Jazz as exemplified by tenor saxophonist Lester Young marked the transition from big bands to the bebop influence of the 1940s . An early 1940s style known as `` jumping the blues '' or jump blues used small combos , uptempo music and blues chord progressions , drawing on boogie - woogie from the 1930s .
