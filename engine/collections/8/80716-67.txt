In typical implementations , the gear ratio of the transmission and epicyclic system are set to the ratio of the common driving conditions , say highway speed for a car , or city speeds for a bus . When the driver presses on the gas , the associated electronics interpret the pedal position and immediately set the gasoline engine to the RPM that provides the best gas mileage for that setting . As the gear ratio is normally set far from the maximum torque point , this set - up would normally result in very poor acceleration . Unlike gasoline engines , electric motors offer efficient torque across a wide selection of RPM , and are especially effective at low settings where the gasoline engine is inefficient . By varying the electrical load or supply on the motor attached to the sun gear , additional torque can be provided to make up for the low torque output from the engine . As the vehicle accelerates , the power to the motor is reduced and eventually ended , providing the illusion of a CVT .
