Before the Bears hired Jauron in January 1999 , Dave McGinnis ( Arizona 's defensive coordinator , and a former Bears assistant under Ditka and Wannstedt ) backed out of taking the head coaching position . The Bears scheduled a press conference to announce the hiring before McGinnis agreed to contract terms . Soon after Jauron 's hiring , Mrs. McCaskey fired her son Michael as president , replacing him with Ted Phillips and promoting Michael to chairman of the board . Phillips , the current Bears president , became the first man outside of the Halas - McCaskey family to run the team .
