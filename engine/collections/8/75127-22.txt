In the 4th century , Coptic script -- based on the Greek alphabet with additional characters from Egyptian demotic to reflect Egyptian phonology -- is found in documents in several dialects , including Old Bohairic , Fayumic , Achmimic , and Sahidic . At this time Coptic emerged as a fully literary language , including major translations of Greek scriptures , liturgical texts , and patristic works . From the 4th to 7th centuries , original works -- including homilies , saints ' lives , monastic rules , letters , and exhortations -- were composed in Coptic , primarily in the Sahidic dialect . As a writing system , Coptic was used for everyday purposes such as inventories and real estate transactions , as well as for poetry . By the 640s , when Egypt came under Arab rule , Coptic - speaking Christians constituted the majority of the population . At the end of the 7th century , legal texts might still be written in Coptic : in one example , a bilingual Greek - Arabic protocol with a reference to Mohammed precedes a document entirely in Coptic that invokes the Trinity .
