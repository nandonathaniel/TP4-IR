At 0100 on 1 April 2003 , the Marines commenced their deception mission , CIA elements cut the city 's power as the helicopters approached their objective , the AH - 6s led the way , behind them the MH - 6s dropped off Task Force 20 sniper teams at strategic locations around and on the hospital . The DAPs and the AH - 6s covered the MH - 60Ks as they dropped off assault teams on the hospital roof and another by the front door , the ground assault convoy arrived and the assaulters raced inside and onto the second floor where Lynch was located . 13 minutes later , a MH - 60K touched down near the hospital entrance with a team of PJs and SOAR medics on board and transported Lynch to Talil where it rendezvoused with a standby medical flight and then onto Kuwait and finally the United States . The Hospital was devoid of any Fedayeen , although evidence suggested they were using it as a base ; the Ranger blocking teams experienced some sporadic direct fire , the SEALs and the Rangers eventually recovered the remains of eight members of Lynch 's unit that had been killed or died of their wounds . Task Force 20 carried out the first successful US POW rescue mission since World War II .
