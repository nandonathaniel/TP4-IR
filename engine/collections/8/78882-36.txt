Peggy Lee as Darling , the motherly human figure and Jim Dear 's wife . Lee also voiced Si and Am , Aunt 's Sarah 's twin Siamese cats with a knack for mischief and never - ending trouble ; and Peg , a stray female Pekingese whom Lady meets at the pound ( along with the other dog inmates she was put in a cage with ) . The names of Si and Am are a play on the country of Siam and the idea of `` Siamese twins '' , the terminology of the time for conjoined twins . It is implied that Peg had a relationship with Tramp in the past , through the lyrics of the song she sings ( He 's a Tramp ) . Peg was formerly from the `` Dog and Pony Follies '' ( dog and pony show ) ; either the show ended or she was left behind . Peg has a Brooklyn Accent .
