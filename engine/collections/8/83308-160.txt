Industry : Extractive industry and manufacturing dominated the sector , including machinery , chemicals , food processing , metallurgy , and textiles . The sector was wasteful in its use of energy , materials , and labor and was slow to upgrade technology , but the country was a major supplier of high - quality machinery , instruments , electronics , aircraft , airplane engines and arms to other socialist countries . Agriculture : Agriculture was a minor sector , but collectivized farms of large acreage and relatively efficient mode of production enabled the country to be relatively self - sufficient in food supply . The country depended on imports of grains ( mainly for livestock feed ) in years of adverse weather . Meat production was constrained by shortage of feed , but the country still recorded high per capita consumption of meat . Foreign trade : Exports were estimated at US $17.8 billion in 1985 . Exports were machinery ( 55 % ) , fuel and materials ( 14 % ) , and manufactured consumer goods ( 16 % ) . Imports stood at estimated US $17.9 billion in 1985 , including fuel and materials ( 41 % ) , machinery ( 33 % ) , and agricultural and forestry products ( 12 % ) . In 1986 , about 80 % of foreign trade was with other socialist countries . Exchange rate : Official , or commercial , rate was crowns ( Kčs ) 5.4 per US $1 in 1987 . Tourist , or non-commercial , rate was Kčs 10.5 per US $1 . Neither rate reflected purchasing power . The exchange rate on the black market was around Kčs 30 per US $1 , which became the official rate once the currency became convertible in the early 1990s . Fiscal year : Calendar year . Fiscal policy : The state was the exclusive owner of means of production in most cases . Revenue from state enterprises was the primary source of revenues followed by turnover tax . The government spent heavily on social programs , subsidies , and investment . Budget was usually balanced or left small surplus .
