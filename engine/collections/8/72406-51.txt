The Tel Dan Stele , an inscribed stone erected by a king of Damascus in the late 9th / early 8th centuries BCE to commemorate his victory over two enemy kings , contains the phrase ביתדוד ‬ , bytdwd , which most scholars translate as `` House of David '' . Other scholars , such as Anson Rainey have challenged this reading , but it is likely that this is a reference to a dynasty of the Kingdom of Judah which traced its ancestry to a founder named David . The Mesha Stele from Moab , dating from approximately the same period , may also contain the name David in two places , although this is less certain than the mention in the Tel Dan inscription .
