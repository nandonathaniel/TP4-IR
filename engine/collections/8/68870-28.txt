Slippery rail has created severe disruptions of rail service , particularly in major metropolitan areas such as New York or Boston . In November 2006 , it was blamed for roughly one - third of all Metro - North Railroad 's Hudson and Harlem lines ' passenger cars being taken out of service . During the same period on the Long Island Rail Road , nearly 25 % of cars were out of service due to slippery rail .
