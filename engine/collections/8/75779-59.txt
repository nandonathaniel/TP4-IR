Bass player Al Rex , who joined Bill Haley and His Comets in the fall of 1955 , told of performing the song when given the spotlight at live performances . `` I used to do ' Hound Dog . ' Haley would get mad at me if I 'd do that . This was even before Presley did it . Haley did n't like those guys from Philadelphia that wrote the song . '' As Leiber and Stoller were not from Philadelphia ( and Haley recorded other Leiber and Stoller songs ) , Haley was probably referring to Freddie Bell and Bernie Lowe , of Philadelphia 's Teen Records .
