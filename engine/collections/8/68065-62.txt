In 1966 , a small change was made to the design to add the initials of the designer ( FS ) to the obverse , underneath Jefferson 's portrait . In commemoration of that change , two specimen 1966 nickels with the initials were struck and presented to him . Coins struck at any mint between 1965 and 1967 lack mint marks , which were omitted as the Mint replaced the silver circulating coins with copper - nickel . Beginning in 1968 , mint marks were again used , and on the nickel were moved to the lower part of the obverse , to the right of Jefferson 's bust . From 1971 , no nickels were struck for circulation in San Francisco -- the 1971 - S was the first nickel struck in proof only since 1878 .
