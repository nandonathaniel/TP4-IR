In January 2011 , Rudolf Elmer , a former Swiss banker , passed data containing account details of 2,000 prominent people to Assange , who stated that the information will be vetted before being made publicly available at a later date . In May 2010 , WikiLeaks said it had video footage of a massacre of civilians in Afghanistan by the US military which they were preparing to release . In an interview with Chris Anderson on 19 July 2010 , Assange showed a document WikiLeaks had on an Albanian oil - well blowout , and said they also had material from inside British Petroleum , and that they were `` getting enormous quantity of whistle - blower disclosures of a very high calibre '' but added that they had not been able to verify and release the material because they did not have enough volunteer journalists . In December 2010 , Assange 's lawyer , Mark Stephens , told The Andrew Marr Show on BBC Television that WikiLeaks had information it considered to be a `` thermo - nuclear device '' which it would release if the organisation needs to defend itself against the authorities .
