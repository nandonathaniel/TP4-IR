The Shih Tzu may be more prone than other breeds to get a blood disease called immune - mediated hemolytic anemia , which causes their immune system to attack itself and kill off their blood cells . This can be found through blood tests but among the signs are yellowing of the skin / gums , tiredness , loss of appetite , and loss of balance that occurs over two days .
