P훮keh훮 had little understanding of all that and accused M훮ori of holding onto land they did not use efficiently . Competition for land was one important cause of the New Zealand Wars of the 1860s and 1870s , in which the Taranaki and Waikato regions were invaded by colonial troops and M훮ori of these regions had some of their land taken from them . The wars and confiscation left bitterness that remains to this day . After the conclusion of the Land Wars some iwi , especially in the Waikato , such as Ngati Haua sold land freely . However , only the chiefs and their whanau benefited from this income . The 2013 Ngati Haua treaty settlement recognised that many Ngati Haua had not received any benefit from the large payments in the 1870s hence the government was paying compensation .
