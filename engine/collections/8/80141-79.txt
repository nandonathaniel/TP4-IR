Brady was selected with pick # 199 , a compensatory pick , in the sixth round of the 2000 NFL Draft . He and his family had believed that Brady would be drafted in the second or third round ; they watched the draft on television , stunned as six other quarterbacks were drafted before him . Brady was so embarrassed that he briefly left the family home during the sixth round , and cried when recalling the experience for an interview 11 years later . When the Patriots notified him that he would be drafted Brady was grateful that , he later said , he would not `` have to be an insurance salesman '' . According to Michael Holley 's book Patriot Reign , the Patriots were considering Brady and Tim Rattay , both of whom had received positive reviews from then - quarterbacks coach Dick Rehbein . Ultimately , the Patriots front office chose Brady . Considering his subsequent success , many analysts have called Brady the best NFL draft pick of all time .
