During this period , the white - dominated Democratic Party maintained political control of the South . With whites controlling all the seats representing the total population of the South , they had a powerful voting block in Congress . The Republican Party -- the `` party of Lincoln '' and the party to which most blacks had belonged -- shrank to insignificance as black voter registration was suppressed except in remote Unionist areas of Appalachia and the Ozarks . Until 1965 , the `` Solid South '' was a one - party system under the Democrats , and excepting previously - noted historic Unionist strongholds the Democratic Party nomination was tantamount to election for state and local office . In 1901 , President Theodore Roosevelt invited Booker T. Washington to dine at the White House , making him the first African American to attend an official dinner there . `` The invitation was roundly criticized by southern politicians and newspapers . '' Washington persuaded the president to appoint more blacks to federal posts in the South and to try to boost African - American leadership in state Republican organizations . However , this was resisted by both white Democrats and white Republicans as an unwanted federal intrusion into state politics .
