A `` dial - in '' is a time the driver estimates it will take his or her car to cross the finish line , and is generally displayed on one or more windows so the starter can adjust the starting lights on the tree accordingly . The slower car will then get a head start equal to the difference in the two dial - ins , so if both cars perform perfectly , they would cross the finish line dead even . If either car goes faster than its dial - in ( called breaking out ) , it is disqualified regardless of who has the lower elapsed time ; if both cars break out , the one who breaks out by the smallest amount wins . However , if a driver had jump - started ( red light ) or crossed a boundary line , both violations override any break out ( except in some classes with an absolute break out rule such as Junior classes ) . This eliminates any advantage from putting a slower time on the windshield to get a head start . The effect of the bracket racing rules is to place a premium on consistency of performance of the driver and car rather than on raw speed , in that victory goes to the driver able to precisely predict elapsed time , whether it is fast or slow . This in turn makes victory much less dependent on large infusions of money , and more dependent on skill . Therefore , bracket racing is popular with casual weekend racers . Many of these recreational racers will drive their vehicles to the track , race them , and then simply drive them home . As most tracks host only one NHRA national event , and two or three regional events ( smaller tours , car shows , etc . ) annually , on most weekends these tracks host local casual and weekend racers . Organizationally , however , the tracks are run according to the rules of either the NHRA or the IHRA with regional points and a championship on the line . Even street vehicles must pass a safety inspection prior to being allowed to race .
