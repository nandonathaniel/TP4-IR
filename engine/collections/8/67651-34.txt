The NFL selected the sites for Super Bowl 50 and Super Bowl LI at the owners ' spring meetings in Boston on May 21 , 2013 . On October 16 , 2012 , the NFL announced that Reliant Stadium in Houston , which was renamed NRG Stadium in 2014 , was a finalist to host Super Bowl LI . Houston then competed against the runner - up for the site of Super Bowl 50 : Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens , Florida . The South Florida bid for either Super Bowl partially depended on whether the stadium underwent renovations . However , on May 3 , the Florida Legislature refused to approve the funding plan to pay for the renovations , dealing a blow to South Florida 's chances . The NFL ultimately selected Houston as the host city of Super Bowl LI .
