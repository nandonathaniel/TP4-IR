During the 1940s , sections of Old San Juan fell into disrepair , and many renovation plans were suggested . There was even a strong push to develop Old San Juan as a `` small Manhattan '' . Strict remodeling codes were implemented to prevent new constructions from affecting the common colonial Spanish architectural themes of the old city . When a project proposal suggested that the old Carmelite Convent in San Juan be demolished to erect a new hotel , the Institute had the building declared as a historic building , and then asked that it be converted to a hotel in a renewed facility . This was what became the Hotel El Convento in Old San Juan . The paradigm to reconstruct and renovate the old city and revitalize it has been followed by other cities in the Americas , particularly Havana , Lima and Cartagena de Indias .
