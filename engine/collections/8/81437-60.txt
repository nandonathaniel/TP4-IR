The Silk Road derives its name from the lucrative Eurasian silk and horse trade , a major reason for the connection of trade routes into an extensive transcontinental network . The German terms Seidenstraße and Seidenstraßen ( `` the Silk Road ( s ) '' ) were coined by Ferdinand von Richthofen , who made seven expeditions to China from 1868 to 1872 . The term Silk Route is also used . Although the term was coined in the 19th century , it did not gain widespread acceptance in academia or popularity among the public until the 20th century . The first book entitled The Silk Road was by Swedish geographer Sven Hedin in 1938 . The fall of the Soviet Union and ' Iron Curtain ' in 1989 led to a surge of public and academic interest in Silk Road sites and studies in the former Soviet republics of Central Asia .
