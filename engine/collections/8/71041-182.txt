If melee weapons could not be brought into combat , such as during long range defense , Qi recommended waiting `` until the face - the - enemy signal ( is given ) , and then , whether from behind wooden stockades , or from moat banks , or from below abatis ( 拒 馬 ) , ( they ) open up on the enemy , firing by turns ( 更 番 射 賊 ) . Those who are empty reload ; those who are full fire again . While the ones who have fired are loading , those who are full then fire again . In this way , all day long , the firing of guns will not be lacking , and there must be no firing to the point of exhaustion ( of ammo ) and no slipups with guns . '' In 1571 Qi prescribed an ideal infantry regiment of 1080 arquebusiers out of 2700 men , or 40 percent of the infantry force . However it is not known how well this was actually implemented , and there is evidence that Qi was met with stiff resistance to the incorporation of newer gunpowder weapons in northern China while he was stationed there . He writes that `` in the north soldiers are stupid and impatient , to the point that they can not see the strength of the musket , and they insist on holding tight to their fast lances ( a type of fire lance ) , and although when comparing and vying on the practice field the musket can hit the bullseye ten times better than the fast - lance and five times better than the bow and arrow , they refuse to be convinced .
