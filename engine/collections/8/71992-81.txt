Joshua Walsh was responsible for creating True Detective 's artwork . His work for the show consists of over 100 individual `` devil 's nests '' -- twig sculptures created by the killer -- along with wall paintings and miniature sculptures of men made of beer cans , among others . According to DiGerlando , Walsh 's interests in hunting and taxidermy made him `` the perfect dude for the job '' . A blueprint for the devil 's nests was not well established in the script , other than specifications that the structures be able to stand on their own and feature a spiral motif . DiGerlando and Walsh went with a tripod design that showed a spiral when viewed from the base , and contained ladder - like crossing elements that symbolized the killer 's desire to ascend to a dark spiritual plane . Each design had subtle differences from one another . DiGerlando cited the work of Henry Darger and James Charles Castle as strong stylistic influences and sought a primitive look for the sculptures , one that revealed the workings of a man with `` some deep inner urge to express himself '' . To reflect this , Walsh built devil 's nests using mud , secondhand children 's clothing , reeds , roots , and other materials he felt the killer would use .
