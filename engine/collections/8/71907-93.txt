Gregory of Nazianzus would say of the Trinity , `` No sooner do I conceive of the One than I am illumined by the splendour of the Three ; no sooner do I distinguish Three than I am carried back into the One . When I think of any of the Three , I think of Him as the Whole , and my eyes are filled , and the greater part of what I am thinking escapes me . I can not grasp the greatness of that One so as to attribute a greater greatness to the rest . When I contemplate the Three together , I see but one torch , and can not divide or measure out the undivided light . ''
