Both contraception and abortion are usually censured by Rastas , and a common claim in Rasta discourse is that these were inventions of Babylon created in an attempt to decrease the black African birth - rate . Rastas also typically express hostile attitudes to homosexuality , regarding homosexuals as evil and unnatural ; this attitude derives from references to same - sex sexual activity in the Bible . The scholar of religion Fortune Sibanda suggested that there were likely homosexual Rastas who deliberately concealed their sexual orientation because of these attitudes .
