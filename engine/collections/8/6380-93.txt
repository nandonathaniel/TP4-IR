Turn ( n = 1 ) The turn , also cycle , full circle , revolution , and rotation , is complete circular movement or measure ( as to return to the same point ) with circle or ellipse . A turn is abbreviated τ , cyc , rev , or rot depending on the application , but in the acronym rpm ( revolutions per minute ) , just r is used . A turn of n units is obtained by setting k = 1 / 2π in the formula above . The equivalence of 1 turn is 360 ° , 2π rad , 400 grad , and 4 right angles . The symbol τ can also be used as a mathematical constant to represent 2π radians . Used in this way ( k = τ / 2π ) allows for radians to be expressed as a fraction of a turn . For example , half a turn is τ / 2 = π .
