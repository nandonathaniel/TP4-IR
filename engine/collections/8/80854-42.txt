Eric Clapton used a 1964 Gibson SG Standard starting in 1967 while in Cream . This guitar was known as the `` Fool '' guitar , as it was painted by the Dutch artists known collectively as The Fool . In spring 1968 , the SG was loaned to Jackie Lomax , an associate of George Harrison . The `` Fool '' was later sold to Todd Rundgren for $500 before eventually being sold to a private collector for about $500,000 .
