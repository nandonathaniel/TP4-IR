There was no line formed on the battlefield . You can take a handful of corn and scatter ( the kernels ) over the floor , and make just such lines . There were none ... The only approach to a line was where 5 or 6 ( dead ) horses found at equal distances , like skirmishers ( part of Lt. Calhoun 's Company L ) . That was the only approach to a line on the field . There were more than 20 ( troopers ) killed ( in one group ) ; there were ( more often ) four or five at one place , all within a space of 20 to 30 yards ( of each other ) ... I counted 70 dead ( cavalry ) horses and 2 Indian ponies .
