About 560 BC , Ephesus was conquered by the Lydians under king Croesus , who , though a harsh ruler , treated the inhabitants with respect and even became the main contributor to the reconstruction of the temple of Artemis . His signature has been found on the base of one of the columns of the temple ( now on display in the British Museum ) . Croesus made the populations of the different settlements around Ephesus regroup ( synoikismos ) in the vicinity of the Temple of Artemis , enlarging the city .
