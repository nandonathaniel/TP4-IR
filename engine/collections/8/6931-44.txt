On January 23 , 1691 , Spain appointed the first governor of Texas , General Domingo Terán de los Ríos . On his visit to Mission San Francisco in August , he discovered that the priests had established a second mission nearby , but were having little luck converting the natives to Christianity . The Indians regularly stole the mission cattle and horses and showed little respect to the priests . When Terán left Texas later that year , most of the missionaries chose to return with him , leaving only 3 religious people and 9 soldiers at the missions . The group also left behind a smallpox epidemic . The angry Caddo threatened the remaining Spaniards , who soon abandoned the fledgling missions and returned to Coahuila . For the next 20 years , Spain again ignored Texas .
