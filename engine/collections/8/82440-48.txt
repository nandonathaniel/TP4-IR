Several basic offensive tactics come into play with a runner on first base , including the fundamental choice of whether to attempt a steal of second base . The hit and run is sometimes employed with a skillful contact hitter : the runner takes off with the pitch drawing the shortstop or second baseman over to second base , creating a gap in the infield for the batter to poke the ball through . The sacrifice bunt calls for the batter to focus on making contact with the ball so that it rolls a short distance into the infield , allowing the runner to advance into scoring position even at the expense of the batter being thrown out at first -- a batter who succeeds is credited with a sacrifice . ( A batter , particularly one who is a fast runner , may also attempt to bunt for a hit . ) A sacrifice bunt employed with a runner on third base , aimed at bringing that runner home , is known as a squeeze play . With a runner on third and fewer than two outs , a batter may instead concentrate on hitting a fly ball that , even if it is caught , will be deep enough to allow the runner to tag up and score -- a successful batter , in this case , gets credit for a sacrifice fly . The manager will sometimes signal a batter who is ahead in the count ( i.e. , has more balls than strikes ) to take , or not swing at , the next pitch .
