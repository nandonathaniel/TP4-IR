Originally called the Cappella Nuova , or New Chapel , in 1622 this chapel was dedicated to Saint Britius ( San Brizio ) , one of the first bishops of Spoleto and Foligno , who evangelized the people of Orvieto . Legend says that he left them a panel of the Madonna della Tavola , a Madonna enthroned with Child and Angels . This painting is from an anonymous late 13th - century master from Orvieto , who was probably influenced by Cimabue and Coppo di Marcovaldo . The face of the Child is a restoration from the 14th century . This panel stands on the late - Baroque altar of the Gloria , dating from 1715 and made by Bernardino Cametti .
