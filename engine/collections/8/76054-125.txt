The name Hong Kong originally referred to a small inlet between Aberdeen Island and the southern coast of Hong Kong Island . The town of Aberdeen was an initial point of contact between British sailors and local fishermen . The source of the romanised name is not known , but it is generally believed to be an early imprecise phonetic rendering of the spoken Cantonese pronunciation of 香港 ( Cantonese Yale : hēung góng ) , which means `` Fragrant Harbour '' or `` Incense Harbour '' . Fragrance may refer to the sweet taste of the harbour 's fresh water influx from the Pearl River estuary or to the incense from factories lining the coast of northern Kowloon . The incense was stored near Aberdeen Harbour for export before Victoria Harbour was developed . Another theory is that the name originates from the Tanka , early inhabitants of the region ; it is equally probable that a romanisation of the name in their dialect was used ( i.e. hōng , not hēung in Cantonese ) . Regardless of origin , the name was recorded in the Treaty of Nanking to encompass all of Hong Kong Island , and has been used to refer to the territory in its entirety ever since .
