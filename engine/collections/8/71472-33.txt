Hydrates are formed by compressing noble gases in water , where it is believed that the water molecule , a strong dipole , induces a weak dipole in the noble gas atoms , resulting in dipole - dipole interaction . Heavier atoms are more influenced than smaller ones , hence Xe 5.75 H O was reported to have been the most stable hydrate ; it has a melting point of 24 Â° C. The deuterated version of this hydrate has also been produced .
