Buddhist texts were initially passed on orally by monks , but were later written down and composed as manuscripts in various Indo - Aryan languages which were then translated into other local languages as Buddhism spread . They can be categorized in a number of ways . The Western terms `` scripture '' and `` canonical '' are applied to Buddhism in inconsistent ways by Western scholars : for example , one authority refers to `` scriptures and other canonical texts '' , while another says that scriptures can be categorized into canonical , commentarial and pseudo-canonical . Buddhist traditions have generally divided these texts with their own categories and divisions , such as that between Buddhavacana `` word of the Buddha , '' many of which are known as `` Sutras , '' and other texts , such as Shastras ( treatises ) or Abhidharma .
