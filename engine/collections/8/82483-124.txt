There should be a Provisional Government of National Unity recognised by all three powers , and that those Poles who were serving in British Army formations should be free to return to Poland . The provisional western border should be the Oder -- Neisse line , with territories to the east of this excluded from the Soviet Occupation zone and placed under Polish and Soviet administration . Poland would receive former German territories in the north and west , but the final delimitation of the western frontier of Poland should await the peace settlement ; which eventually took place as the Treaty on the Final Settlement With Respect to Germany in 1990 .
