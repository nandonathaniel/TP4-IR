In Calcutta , the Governor - General remained head of the Government of India and now was more commonly called the Viceroy on account of his secondary role as the Crown 's representative to the nominally sovereign princely states ; he was , however , now responsible to the Secretary of State in London and through him to Parliament . A system of `` double government '' had already been in place during the Company 's rule in India from the time of Pitt 's India Act of 1784 . The Governor - General in the capital , Calcutta , and the Governor in a subordinate presidency ( Madras or Bombay ) was each required to consult his advisory council ; executive orders in Calcutta , for example , were issued in the name of `` Governor - General - in - Council '' ( i.e. the Governor - General with the advice of the Council ) . The Company 's system of `` double government '' had its critics , since , from the time of the system 's inception , there had been intermittent feuding between the Governor - General and his Council ; still , the Act of 1858 made no major changes in governance . However , in the years immediately thereafter , which were also the years of post-rebellion reconstruction , Viceroy Lord Canning found the collective decision making of the Council to be too time - consuming for the pressing tasks ahead , so he requested the `` portfolio system '' of an Executive Council in which the business of each government department ( the `` portfolio '' ) was assigned to and became the responsibility of a single council member . Routine departmental decisions were made exclusively by the member , but important decisions required the consent of the Governor - General and , in the absence of such consent , required discussion by the entire Executive Council . This innovation in Indian governance was promulgated in the Indian Councils Act 1861 .
