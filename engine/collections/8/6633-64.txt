On Gemini 3 ( March 1965 ) , astronauts Virgil `` Gus '' Grissom and John W. Young became the first to demonstrate their ability to change their craft 's orbit . On Gemini 5 ( August 1965 ) , astronauts L. Gordon Cooper and Charles `` Pete '' Conrad set a record of almost eight days in space , long enough for a piloted lunar mission . On Gemini 6A ( December 1965 ) , Command Pilot Wally Schirra achieved the first space rendezvous with Gemini 7 , accurately matching his orbit to that of the other craft , station - keeping for three consecutive orbits at distances as close as 1 foot ( 0.30 m ) . Gemini 7 also set a human spaceflight endurance record of fourteen days for Frank Borman and James A. Lovell , which stood until both nations started launching space laboratories in the early 1970s . On Gemini 8 ( March 1966 ) , Command Pilot Neil Armstrong achieved the first docking between two spacecraft , his Gemini craft and an Agena target vehicle . Gemini 11 ( September 1966 ) , commanded by Conrad , achieved the first direct - ascent rendezvous with its Agena target on the first orbit , and used the Agena 's rocket to achieve an apogee of 742 nautical miles ( 1,374 km ) , the crewed Earth orbit record still current as of 2015 . On Gemini 12 ( November 1966 ) , Edwin E. `` Buzz '' Aldrin spent over five hours working comfortably during three ( EVA ) sessions , finally proving that humans could perform productive tasks outside their spacecraft . This proved to be the most difficult goal to achieve .
