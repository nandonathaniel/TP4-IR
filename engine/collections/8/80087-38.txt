Dixon then contacts Mildred , letting her know that he may have found Angela 's killer . They are both soon disheartened after Dixon learns from Abercrombie that the suspect 's DNA and the DNA from the crime scene do not match , also supported by the suspect 's being on active duty in the Middle East when Angela 's rape and murder took place . Aware that a rapist ( of someone other than Angela ) is still on the loose , Mildred and Dixon drive to Idaho where the man lives . On the way , Mildred confesses that she was the one who caused the police station fire to which Dixon replies that he already suspected as much and forgives her . They contemplate on whether or not they should kill the rapist when they find him and resolve to decide once they arrive .
