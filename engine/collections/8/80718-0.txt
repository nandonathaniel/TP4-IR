Dragon Ball Z Kai ( known in Japan as Dragon Ball Kai ) is a revised version of the anime series Dragon Ball Z . It was produced in commemoration of the original series ' 20th and 25th anniversaries . Produced by Toei Animation , the series was broadcast in Japan on Fuji TV from April 5 , 2009 to March 27 , 2011 . It later continued with the final story arc from April 6 , 2014 to June 28 , 2015 . It features remastered high definition picture , sound , and special effects as well as a re-recorded voice track by most of the original cast . As most of the series ' sketches and animation cels had been discarded since the final episode of Dragon Ball Z in 1996 , new frames were produced by digitally tracing over still frames from existing footage and filling them with softer colors . This reduced visible damage to the original animation . Some frames were selectively cropped , while other frames feature new portions added to scenes that were hand drawn to conform to the designated picture ratio . Much of the material from the Dragon Ball Z anime that was not featured in the Dragon Ball manga has been left out in Kai , which reduced the total episode count from 291 to 167 . However , the second part of the series , titled Dragon Ball Z Kai : The Final Chapters by Toei Europe and Funimation , lasted 61 episodes in Japan , which was fewer than the previously planned 69 . This brought the total number of episodes to 159 in Japan . The first Blu - ray and DVD compilation was released in Japan on September 18 , 2009 . Individual volumes and Blu - ray box sets were released monthly . France was the first international country to release all 167 episodes on Blu - ray and DVD , while the bypassed episodes remain unreleased in Japan .
