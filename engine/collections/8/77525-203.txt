From the start , it is clear that Goku is much faster and stronger than King Choppa . He jumps in the air , and on his way down , he blows at the ground to slow himself down and throw off King Choppa 's timing . He then delivers the final blow . Jackie Chun then enters his fight , and although he is completely distracted with thoughts of Goku 's new strength , he defeats his opponent in three blows . The preliminary rounds continue until the first intermission . During the meal , Yamcha and Tien nearly get in a fight , but once again , Jackie Chun stops them . Nam comes up to Goku to greet him . He is fighting in the tournament again , but this time it is only for fun , since his village is in no need of water anymore . Later , in the last match before the finals , Nam is nearly killed by Tien . Goku , Krillin , Yamcha and Jackie Chun all advance to the final round .
