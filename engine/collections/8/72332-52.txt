Actor Kirk Douglas -- who had originated the role of McMurphy in the 1963 -- 64 Broadway stage version of the Ken Kesey novel -- had purchased the film rights to the story , and tried for a decade to bring it to the big screen , but was unable to find a studio willing to make it with him . Eventually , he gave the rights to his son Michael Douglas , who succeeded in getting the film produced -- but the elder Douglas , by then nearly 60 , was considered too old for the McMurphy role , which ultimately went to 38 - year - old Jack Nicholson .
