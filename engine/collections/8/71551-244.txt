Ido has the masculine infix - ul and the feminine infix - in for animate beings . Both are optional and used only if it is necessary to avoid ambiguity : kato `` a cat '' , katulo `` a male cat '' , katino `` a female cat '' . There are third - person singular and plural pronouns for all three genders , masculine , feminine , and neuter , but also gender - free pronouns .
