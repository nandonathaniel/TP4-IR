The Pacific Islands are ruled by a tropical rainforest and tropical savanna climate . In the tropical and subtropical Pacific , the El Ni√±o Southern Oscillation ( ENSO ) affects weather conditions . In the tropical western Pacific , the monsoon and the related wet season during the summer months contrast with dry winds in the winter which blow over the ocean from the Asian landmass . November is the only month in which all the tropical cyclone basins are active .
