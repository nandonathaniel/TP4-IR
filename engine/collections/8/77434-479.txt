The Afghan Army was plagued by inefficiency and endemic corruption . U.S. training efforts were drastically slowed by the problems . U.S. trainers reported missing vehicles , weapons and other military equipment , and outright theft of fuel . Death threats were leveled against U.S. officers who tried to stop Afghan soldiers from stealing . Afghan soldiers often snipped the command wires of IEDs instead of marking them and waiting for U.S. forces to come to detonate them . This allowed insurgents to return and reconnect them . U.S. trainers frequently removed the cell phones of Afghan soldiers hours before a mission for fear that the operation would be compromised . American trainers often spent large amounts of time verifying that Afghan rosters were accurate -- that they are not padded with `` ghosts '' being `` paid '' by Afghan commanders who stole the wages .
