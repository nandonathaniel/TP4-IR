Although a distant planet such as Planet Nine would reflect little light , it would still be radiating the heat from its formation as it cools due to its large mass . At its estimated temperature of 47 K , the peak of its emissions would be at infrared wavelengths . This radiation signature could be detected by Earth - based infrared telescopes , such as ALMA , and a search could be conducted by cosmic microwave background experiments operating at mm wavelengths . Additionally , Jim Green of NASA is optimistic that it could be observed by the James Webb Space Telescope , the successor to the Hubble Space Telescope , that is expected to be launched in 2018 .
