In 1866 , Austria reneged on the agreement and demanded that the Diet determine the Schleswig -- Holstein issue . Bismarck used this as an excuse to start a war with Austria by accusing them of violating the Gastein Convention . Bismarck sent Prussian troops to occupy Holstein . Provoked , Austria called for the aid of other German states , who quickly became involved in the Austro - Prussian War . Thanks to Roon 's reorganization , the Prussian army was nearly equal in numbers to the Austrian army . With the strategic genius of Moltke , the Prussian army fought battles it was able to win . Bismarck had also made a secret alliance with Italy , who desired Austrian - controlled Veneto . Italy 's entry into the war forced the Austrians to divide their forces .
