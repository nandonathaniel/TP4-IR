Crunchy coated peanuts , called kabukim in Hebrew , are a popular snack in Israel . Kabukim are commonly sold by weight at corner stores where fresh nuts and seeds are sold , though they are also available packaged . The coating typically consists of flour , salt , starch , lecithin , and sometimes sesame seeds . The origin of the name is obscure ( it may be derived from kabuk which means nutshell or husk in Turkish ) . An additional variety of crunchy coated peanuts popular in Israel is `` American peanuts '' . The coating of this variety is thinner , but harder to crack .
