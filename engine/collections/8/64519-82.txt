The 18th congress of CPI ( M ) , held in Delhi in 2005 , re-elected Basu to its Politburo , although he had asked to be allowed to retire from it . On 13 September 2006 , Basu entreated the CPI ( M ) to allow his retirement due to his age , but was turned down . General secretary Prakash Karat said that the party wanted Basu to continue until its 2008 congress , at which point it would reconsider . At the 19th congress in early April 2008 , Basu was not included on the Politburo , although he remained a member of the Central Committee and was designated as Special Invitee to the Politburo . In the course of seven decades of work in the Communist party , Basu spent three and a half years in prison and two years underground . After the fall of the Soviet Union and the setbacks to socialism , he provided the leadership along with his colleagues in the Politburo to make a reappraisal of the experience of building socialism and to pinpoint the errors and to correct wrong notions and understandings while remaining true to Marxism -- Leninism . He was a Marxist who was not dogmatic and continued to learn from his vast experience in charting out the course for the Party .
