In elastodynamics , Love waves , named after Augustus Edward Hough Love , are horizontally polarized surface waves . The Love wave is a result of the interference of many shear waves ( S -- waves ) guided by an elastic layer , which is welded to an elastic half space on one side while bordering a vacuum on the other side . In seismology , Love waves ( also known as Q waves ( Quer : German for lateral ) ) are surface seismic waves that cause horizontal shifting of the Earth during an earthquake . Augustus Edward Hough Love predicted the existence of Love waves mathematically in 1911 . They form a distinct class , different from other types of seismic waves , such as P - waves and S - waves ( both body waves ) , or Rayleigh waves ( another type of surface wave ) . Love waves travel with a lower velocity than P - or S - waves , but faster than Rayleigh waves . These waves are observed only when there is a low velocity layer overlying a high velocity layer / sub -- layers .
