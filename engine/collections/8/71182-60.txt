The government and rebels negotiated a peace agreement that established the Bougainville Autonomous District and Province . The autonomous Bougainville elected Joseph Kabui as president in 2005 , who served until his death in 2008 . He was succeeded by his deputy John Tabinaman as acting president while an election to fill the unexpired term was organised . James Tanis won that election in December 2008 and served until the inauguration of John Momis , the winner of the 2010 elections . As part of the current peace settlement , a referendum on independence is planned to be held in Bougainville sometime before mid-2020 . Preparations were underway in 2015 .
