ASIC cards can be issued for a specific airport which will have the airport code designation on them , such as SYD or MEL , or they can be issued with the AUS designation , making it valid nationwide . This is one of the key differences to the SIDA card used in the United States , where each airport issues their own card for use at that particular airport only which can present issues for flight crews operating at different airports .
