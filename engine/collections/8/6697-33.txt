Stimulus enhancement -- Individuals become interested in an object from watching others interact with it . Increased interest in an object may result in object manipulation , which facilitates new object - related behaviors by trial - and - error learning . For example , a young killer whale might become interested in playing with a sea lion pup after watching other whales toss the sea lion pup around . After playing with the pup , the killer whale may develop foraging behaviors appropriate to such prey . In this case , the killer whale did not learn to prey on sea lions by observing other whales do so , but rather the killer whale became intrigued after observing other whales play with the pup . After the killer whale became interested , then its interactions with the sea lion resulted in behaviors that provoked future foraging efforts . Goal emulation -- Individuals are enticed by the end result of an observed behavior and attempt the same outcome but with a different method . For example , Haggerty ( 1909 ) devised an experiment in which a monkey climbed up the side of a cage , stuck its arm into a wooden chute , and pulled a rope in the chute to release food . Another monkey was provided an opportunity to obtain the food after watching a monkey go through this process on four separate occasions . The monkey performed a different method and finally succeeded after trial and error .
