George Allen led the Rams from 1966 to 1970 and introduced many innovations , including the hiring of a young Dick Vermeil as one of the first special teams coaches . Though Allen would enjoy five straight winning seasons and win two divisional titles in his time with the Rams he never won a playoff game with the team , losing in 1967 to Green Bay 28 -- 7 and in 1969 23 -- 20 to Minnesota . Allen would leave after the 1970 season to take the head coaching job for the Washington Redskins .
