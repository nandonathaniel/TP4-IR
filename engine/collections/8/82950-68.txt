In The Fellowship of the Ring , Gandalf deduced that the ring that Bilbo had found in Gollum 's cave was indeed Sauron 's lost Master - ring . He informed Frodo about the true nature of the heirloom Bilbo had left for him , and its terrible potential if Sauron should ever regain it : `` The Enemy still lacks one thing to give him strength and knowledge to beat down all resistance , break the last defences , and cover all the lands in a second darkness . He lacks the One Ring ... So he is seeking it , seeking it , and all his thought is bent on it . ''
