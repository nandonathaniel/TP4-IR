The non-human apes ( the gibbons , mountain and lowland gorillas , orangutan , chimpanzee and bonobo ) tend to walk on the lateral side of the foot , that is with an ' inverted ' foot , which may reflect a basic adaptation to walking on branches . It is often held that their feet lack longitudinal arches , but footprints made by bipedally walking apes , which must directly or indirectly reflect the pressure they exert to support and propel themselves do suggest that they exert lower foot pressure under the medial part of their midfoot .
