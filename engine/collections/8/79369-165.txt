Woods , Jr. , asserts that , despite the widely held conception of the Catholic Church as being anti-science , this conventional wisdom has been the subject of `` drastic revision '' by historians of science over the last 50 years . Woods asserts that the mainstream view now is that the `` Church ( has ) played a positive role in the development of science ... even if this new consensus has not yet managed to trickle down to the general public .

Yet the message has rarely escaped the ivory tower . ''
