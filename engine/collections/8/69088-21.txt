In union possession can also be contested at line - outs ( played after the ball has gone into touch ) and scrums . In the same study it was found that the team with the ball at a scrum regained possession 90 percent of the time , while the team with the ball at a lineout regained possession 80 percent of the time . League does not have a lineout , but does utilise a scrum to restart play . It is uncommon for modern rugby league scrums to be contested , with the side awarded the scrum almost always gaining possession . Possession can also be contested following kicks to restart play from the halfway , 22 metre in both games ( and from the goal line in league ) . Generally league restarts are likely to go for distance unless possession is needed quickly ( usually if a team is behind with very little time left to play ) . Union restarts are more likely to be short to allow players to contest possession in the air .
