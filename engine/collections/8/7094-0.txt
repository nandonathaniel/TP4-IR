The Venus de ' Medici or Medici Venus is a Hellenistic marble sculpture depicting the Greek goddess of love Aphrodite . It is a 1st - century BCE marble copy , perhaps made in Athens , of a bronze original Greek sculpture , following the type of the Aphrodite of Knidos , which would have been made by a sculptor in the immediate Praxitelean tradition , perhaps at the end of the century . It has become one of the navigation points by which the progress of the Western classical tradition is traced , the references to it outline the changes of taste and the process of classical scholarship . It is housed in the Uffizi Gallery , Florence , Italy .
