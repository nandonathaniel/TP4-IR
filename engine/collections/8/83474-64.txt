Kansas City 's suburban development began with a streetcar system in the early decades of the 20th century . The city 's first suburbs were in the neighborhoods of Pendleton Heights and Quality Hill . After World War II , many relatively affluent residents left for suburbs in Johnson County , Kansas , and eastern Jackson County , Missouri . Many also went north of the Missouri River , where Kansas City had incorporated areas between the 1940s and 1970s .
