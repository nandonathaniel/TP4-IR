AIDS was first clinically observed in 1981 in the United States . The initial cases were a cluster of injecting drug users and homosexual men with no known cause of impaired immunity who showed symptoms of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia ( PCP ) , a rare opportunistic infection that was known to occur in people with very compromised immune systems . Soon thereafter , an unexpected number of homosexual men developed a previously rare skin cancer called Kaposi 's sarcoma ( KS ) . Many more cases of PCP and KS emerged , alerting U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) and a CDC task force was formed to monitor the outbreak .
