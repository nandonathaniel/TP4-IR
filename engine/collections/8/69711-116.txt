In December 2013 , Israel , Jordan and the Palestinian Authority signed an agreement for laying a water pipeline to link the Red Sea with the Dead Sea . The pipeline will be 180 km ( 110 mi ) long and is estimated to take up to five years to complete . In January 2015 it was reported that the level of water is now dropping by 1 m ( 3 ft ) a year .
