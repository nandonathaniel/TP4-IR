On 14 April 1931 , the arrival of the Second Spanish Republic caused the club to lose the title Real and went back to being named Madrid Football Club . Football continued during the Second World War , and on 13 June 1943 Madrid beat Barcelona 11 -- 1 in the second leg of a semi-final of the Copa del Generalísimo , the Copa del Rey having been renamed in honour of General Franco . It has been suggested Barcelona players were intimidated by police , including by the director of state security who `` allegedly told the team that some of them were only playing because of the regime 's generosity in permitting them to remain in the country . '' The Barcelona chairman , Enric Piñeyro , was assaulted by Madrid fans . However , none of these allegations have been proven and FIFA and UEFA still consider the result as legitimate . According to Spanish journalist and writer , Juan Carlos Pasamontes , Barcelona player Josep Valle denied that the Spanish security forces came before the match . Instead , at the end of the first half , Barcelona coach Juan José Nogués and all of his players were angry with the hard - style of play Real Madrid was using and with the aggressiveness of the home crowd . When they refused to take the field , the Superior Chief of Police of Madrid appeared , identified himself , and ordered the team to take the field .
