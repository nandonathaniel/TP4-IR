The general geological structure of the Peak District is that of a broad dome , whose western margins have been most intensely faulted and folded . Uplift and erosion have effectively sliced the top off the dome to reveal a concentric outcrop pattern with Coal Measures rocks on the eastern and western margins , Carboniferous Limestone at the core and with rocks of Millstone Grit outcropping between them . The southern edge of the dome is overlain by sandstones of Triassic age though they barely impinge on the National Park .
