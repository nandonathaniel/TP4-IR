Transcription dependent response For example , steroids act directly as transcription factor ( gives slow response , as transcription factor must bind DNA , which needs to be transcribed . Produced mRNA needs to be translated , and the produced protein / peptide can undergo Posttranslational_modification ( PMT ) ) Transcription independent response For example , epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) binds the epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) , which causes dimerization and autophosphorylation of the EGFR , which in turn activates the intracellular signaling pathway .
