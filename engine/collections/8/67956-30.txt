During the 1930s , several advances in school buses were seen that would change its design and production forever . To better adapt automotive chassis design , school bus entry doors were moved from the rear to the front curbside , becoming a door operated by the driver ( to ease loading passengers and improve forward visibility ) . However , school buses retained the rear door , re-purposed as an emergency exit . Following the introduction of the steel - paneled 1927 Luce bus , school bus manufacturing began to transition towards all - steel bus bodies . In 1930 , both Wayne and Superior introduced all - steel school buses , with the latter introducing a body with safety glass windows .
