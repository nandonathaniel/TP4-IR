Texas has no laws regarding possession of any firearm regardless of age , without felony convictions ; all existing restrictions in State law mirror Federal law . A person of any age , except certain Felons , can possess a firearm such as at a firing range . Texas and Federal law only regulate the ownership of all firearms to 18 years of age or older , and regulate the transfer of handguns to 21 years or older by FFL dealers . However , a private citizen may sell , gift , lease etc. a handgun to anyone over 18 who is not Felon or is a Felon that is 5 years removed from Felony infraction of probation or parole end date and is now a law abiding citizen . NFA weapons are also only subject to Federal restrictions ; no State regulations exist . Municipal and county ordinances on possession and carry are generally overridden ( preempted ) due to the wording of the Texas Constitution , which gives the Texas Legislature ( and it alone ) the power to `` regulate the wearing of arms , with a view to prevent crime '' . Penal Code Section 1.08 also prohibits local jurisdictions from enacting or enforcing any law that conflicts with State statute . Local ordinances restricting discharge of a firearm are generally allowed as State law has little or no specification thereof , but such restrictions do not preempt State law concerning justification of use of force and deadly force .
