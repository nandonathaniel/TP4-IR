The Cleric ( voiced by Steve Purcell ) - An anthropomorphic Ludodactylus and the `` spiritual '' leader of the Battlesaurs . The Cleric is the first Battlesaur shown to be aware of their status as toys , but conceals it from the others so that he can rule over them and Mason 's other toys . However , his plans are thwarted when Reptillus sides with Trixie ; he is later shown apparently enjoying his new role as Mason 's plaything .
