Many of these experiments examined the influence of sugar - sweetened soft drinks on weight gain in children and adolescents . In one experiment , adolescents replaced sugar - sweetened soft drinks in their diet with artificially sweetened soft drinks that were sent to their homes over 25 weeks . Compared with children in a control group , children who received the artificially sweetened drinks saw a smaller increase in their BMI ( by − 0.14 kg / m ) , but this effect was only statistically significant among the heaviest children ( who saw a benefit of − 0.75 kg / m ) . In another study , an educational program encouraged schoolchildren to consume fewer soft drinks . During the school year , the prevalence of obesity decreased among children in the program by 0.2 % , compared to a 7.5 % increase among children in the control group . Another study , published in Pediatrics in 2013 , concluded that for children from the age of 2 to 5 , their risk of obesity increased by 43 % if they were regular soft drink consumers as opposed to those who rarely or never consumed them .
