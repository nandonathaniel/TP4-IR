For the record , the rupee was never equal to the dollar . At the time of independence ( in 1947 ) , India 's currency was pegged to pound sterling , and the exchange rate was a shilling and six pence for a rupee -- which worked out to Rs 13.33 to the pound . The dollar - pound exchange rate then was $4.03 to the pound , which in effect gave a rupee - dollar rate in 1947 of around Rs 3.30 . The pound was devalued in 1949 , changing its dollar parity from 4.03 to 2.80 . India was then a part of the sterling area , and the rupee was devalued on the same day by the same percentage , so that the new dollar exchange rate in 1949 became Rs 4.76 -- which is where it stayed till the rupee devaluation of 1966 made it Rs 7.50 to the dollar and the pound moved to Rs 21 .
