The River Thames can first be identified as a discrete drainage line as early as 58 million years ago , in the Thanetian stage of the late Palaeocene epoch . Until around 500,000 years ago , the Thames flowed on its existing course through what is now Oxfordshire , before turning to the north east through Hertfordshire and East Anglia and reaching the North Sea near Ipswich .
