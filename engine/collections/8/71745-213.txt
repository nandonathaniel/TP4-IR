In 1975 , Sebastian von Hoerner proposed a formula for population growth which represented hyperbolic growth with an infinite population in 2025 . The hyperbolic growth of the world population observed until the 1970s was later correlated to a non-linear second order positive feedback between demographic growth and technological development . This feedback can be described as follows : technological advance → increase in the carrying capacity of land for people → demographic growth → more people → more potential inventors → acceleration of technological advance → accelerating growth of the carrying capacity → faster population growth → accelerating growth of the number of potential inventors → faster technological advance → hence , the faster growth of the Earth 's carrying capacity for people , and so on . The transition from hyperbolic growth to slower rates of growth is related to the demographic transition .
