It was seen in Figure 2 that Foucault placed the rotating mirror R as close as possible to lens L so as to maximize the distance between R and the slit S. As R rotates , an enlarged image of slit S sweeps across the face of the distant mirror M. The greater the distance RM , the more quickly that the image sweeps across mirror M and the less light is reflected back . Foucault could not increase the RM distance in his folded optical arrangement beyond about 20 meters without the image of the slit becoming too dim to accurately measure .
