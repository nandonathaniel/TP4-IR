Although Iceland was under the political control of Denmark until a much later date ( 1918 ) , very little influence and borrowing from Danish has occurred in the Icelandic language . Icelandic remained the preferred language among the ruling classes in Iceland . Danish was not used for official communications , most of the royal officials were of Icelandic descent and the language of the church and law courts remained Icelandic .
