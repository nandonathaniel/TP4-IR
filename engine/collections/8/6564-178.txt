Flowers and trees , along with water , rocks and architecture , are the fourth essential element of the Chinese garden . They represent nature in its most vivid form , and contrast with the straight lines of the architecture and the permanence , sharp edges and immobility of the rocks . They change continually with the seasons , and provide both sounds ( the sound of rain on banana leaves or the wind in the bamboo ) and aromas to please the visitor .
