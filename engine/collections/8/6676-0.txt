A winged infusion set -- also known as `` butterfly '' or `` scalp vein '' set -- is a device specialized for venipuncture : i.e. for accessing a superficial vein for either intravenous injection or phlebotomy . It consists , from front to rear , of a hypodermic needle , two bilateral flexible `` wings '' , flexible small - bore transparent tubing ( often 20 -- 35 cm long ) , and lastly a connector ( often female Luer ) . This connector attaches to another device : e.g. syringe , vacuum tube holder / hub , or extension tubing from an infusion pump or gravity - fed infusion / transfusion bag / bottle .
