Both the lyrics and melody of the official anthem have been criticised in some quarters as being dull and unendearing to the Australian people . A National Party senator , Sandy Macdonald , said in 2001 that `` Advance Australia Fair '' is so boring that the nation risks singing itself to sleep , with boring music and words impossible to understand . A parliamentary colleague , Peter Slipper , said that Australia should consider another anthem . One suggested replacement was `` I Am Australian '' , notably in 2011 by former Victorian Premier Jeff Kennett .
