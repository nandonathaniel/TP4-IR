Arkane was influenced by some criticisms of the first Dishonored . Although the difficulty was not considered a major problem , a sizeable number of players had complained the first was too easy , and thus the harder difficulty settings were reworked . The chaos system of Dishonored , considered as merely a binary ersatz meter , was intended to have more depth in the sequel . The altered chaos system , where different individuals grant varying amounts of chaos , was implemented due to how many players used the Heart in the original game . As the Heart would reveal secrets about whomever it was pointed at , players would use it to decide which NPCs to kill and which to leave be or spare . Also intended to yield additional improvements was the upgrade system , which would for the first time level up based on a skill tree . Bonecharms were made into craftable items , with 400,000 possible combinations available . While taking into account the intricacies of how supernatural abilities would be used , designers faced increased difficulty in relation to the play - style where the game is traversed in their absence , noting the accommodation of the play - style in a way that would not cancel out the other as a challenge .
