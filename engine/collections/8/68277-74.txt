In 1950 , CBS asked Ball to take My Favorite Husband to television with co-star Richard Denning . She , however , saw a television show as a great opportunity to work with Desi as it would keep them both in Hollywood , and perhaps save their shaky marriage . Lucy insisted that Desi play her husband , much to the dismay of CBS , which was reluctant because Arnaz was Cuban . Network executives believed that audiences would not believe the marriage between an all - American girl and a Latin man . To prove CBS wrong , the couple developed a vaudeville act , written by Carroll and Pugh , that they took on the road with Arnaz 's orchestra . The act was a hit and convinced CBS executive Harry Ackerman that a Ball - Arnaz pairing would be a worthwhile venture . At the same time , rival networks NBC , ABC , and DuMont were showing interest in a Ball - Arnaz series , which Ackerman used to convince CBS to sign the duo .
