The Raiders won the AFC West in 2000 with a 12 -- 4 record and the best rushing offense in the league . However , they lost the AFC Championship Game to the eventual Super Bowl XXXV champion Baltimore Ravens , 16 -- 3 . After signing veteran Pro Bowl wide receiver Jerry Rice and defensive tackle Trace Armstrong , the team repeated as AFC West champions in 2001 , but were eliminated in the AFC Divisional Game by the eventual Super Bowl XXXVI champion New England Patriots in what became known as the `` Tuck Rule Game '' , in which a potential game - ending fumble recovery by the Raiders was overturned by instant replay .
