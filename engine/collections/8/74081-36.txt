While many holes are designed with a direct line - of - sight from the teeing ground to the green , a hole may bend either to the left or to the right . This is called a `` dogleg '' , in reference to the similarity to a dog 's ankle . The hole is called a `` dogleg left '' if the hole angles leftwards , and a `` dogleg right '' if the hole angles rightwards . A hole 's direction may bend twice , which is called a `` double dogleg '' .
