Following the Tsar 's abdication , Vladimir Lenin was ushered by train from Switzerland into Russia 16 April 1917 . He was financed by Jacob Schiff . Discontent and the weaknesses of the Provisional Government led to a rise in the popularity of the Bolshevik Party , led by Lenin , which demanded an immediate end to the war . The Revolution of November was followed in December by an armistice and negotiations with Germany . At first , the Bolsheviks refused the German terms , but when German troops began marching across Ukraine unopposed , the new government acceded to the Treaty of Brest - Litovsk on 3 March 1918 . The treaty ceded vast territories , including Finland , the Baltic provinces , parts of Poland and Ukraine to the Central Powers . Despite this enormous apparent German success , the manpower required for German occupation of former Russian territory may have contributed to the failure of the Spring Offensive and secured relatively little food or other materiel for the Central Powers war effort .
