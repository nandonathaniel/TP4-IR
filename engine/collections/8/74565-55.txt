Poet Walt Whitman ( 1819 -- 1892 ) , whose major work Leaves of Grass was first published in 1855 , was influenced by transcendentalism . Influenced by Ralph Waldo Emerson and the Transcendentalist movement , itself an offshoot of Romanticism , Whitman 's poetry praises nature and the individual human 's role in it . However , much like Emerson , Whitman does not diminish the role of the mind or the spirit ; rather , he elevates the human form and the human mind , deeming both worthy of poetic praise .
