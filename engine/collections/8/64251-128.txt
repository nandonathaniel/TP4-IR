The aircraft fleet grew from crop spraying aircraft to larger transports and helicopters used to support ground troops and transport personnel . As these operations became more involved in direct combat , a further need for search and rescue and armed escort helicopters was evident . Operations in the 1980s and 1990s were primarily carried out in Colombia , Guatemala , Peru , Bolivia and Belize . Many aircraft have since been passed on to the governments involved , as they became capable of taking over the operations themselves .
