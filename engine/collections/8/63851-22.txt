Flash - based players : These are non-mechanical solid state devices that hold digital audio files on internal flash memory or removable flash media called memory cards . Due to technological advances in flash memory , these originally low - storage devices are now available commercially ranging up to 128 GB . Because they are solid state and do not have moving parts they require less battery power , are less likely to skip during playback , and may be more resilient to hazards such as dropping or fragmentation than hard disk - based players . There are USB flash drives available that include basic MP3 playback capabilities .
