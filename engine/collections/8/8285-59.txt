Though the cast ultimately proved to be one of the film 's greatest strengths , Friedkin had problems with casting choices from the start . He was strongly opposed to the choice of Hackman for the lead , and actually first considered Paul Newman ( out of the budget range ) , then Jackie Gleason , Peter Boyle and a New York columnist , Jimmy Breslin , who had never acted before . However , Gleason , at that time , was considered box - office poison by the studio after his film Gigot had flopped several years before , Boyle declined the role after disapproving of the violent theme of the film , and Breslin refused to get behind the wheel of a car , which was required of Popeye 's character for an integral car chase scene . Steve McQueen was also considered , but he did not want to do another police film after Bullitt and , as with Newman , his fee would have exceeded the movie 's budget . Tough guy Charles Bronson was also considered for the role . Friedkin almost settled for Rod Taylor ( who had actively pursued the role , according to Hackman ) , another choice the studio approved , before he went with Hackman .
