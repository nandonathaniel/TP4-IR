The first uses of the term `` curtilage '' by the Supreme Court appeared in the decisions of two unrelated cases from 1864 . United States v. Stone ( 1864 ) , involved a boundary dispute over Fort Leavenworth , as to `` what lands properly belonged to this military post , and the proper curtilage necessary for the use and enjoyment of it '' .
