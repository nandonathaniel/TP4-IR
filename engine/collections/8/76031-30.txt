Tursiops truncatus has a bigger brain than humans . Numerous investigations of bottlenose dolphin intelligence include tests of mimicry , use of artificial language , object categorization , and self - recognition . This intelligence has driven considerable interaction with humans . Common bottlenose dolphins are popular in aquarium shows and television programs such as Flipper . They have also been trained for military uses such as locating sea mines or detecting and marking enemy divers , as for example in the U.S. Navy Marine Mammal Program . In some areas , they cooperate with local fishermen by driving fish toward the fishermen and eating the fish that escape the fishermen 's nets .
