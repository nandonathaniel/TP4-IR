Poe 's sequel to `` The Murders in the Rue Morgue '' was `` The Mystery of Marie Rogêt '' , first serialized in December 1842 and January 1843 . Though subtitled `` A Sequel to ' The Murders in the Rue Morgue ' '' , `` The Mystery of Marie Rogêt '' shares very few common elements with `` The Murders in the Rue Morgue '' beyond the inclusion of C. Auguste Dupin and the Paris setting . Dupin reappeared in `` The Purloined Letter '' , which Poe called `` perhaps the best of my tales of ratiocination '' in a letter to James Russell Lowell in July 1844 .
