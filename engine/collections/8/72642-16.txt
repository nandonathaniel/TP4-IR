Balki is very close to his mother , whom he calls `` Mamma '' . He sends her half of his paycheck and frequently writes her letters . She was an unseen character until she appeared in the season 7 episode ( Citizenship ) , but Balki spoke of her often in the series . In `` Citizenship '' , Balki 's mother ( also played by Pinchot ) came to the United States to see Balki become an American citizen ( though due to a mistranslation on Larry 's part , Balki 's mother originally thought she was coming to see Balki get his driver 's license ) . When Balki 's mother learned that Balki was becoming an American citizen , she was hurt because she had hoped that Balki would return to Mypos . Balki 's mother gave Balki a `` chicken foot '' with a missing toe , which meant that unless he did what his mother wished , Balki was no longer her son . Balki returned to Mypos , and Larry followed him to convince Balki 's mother to let Balki return to the United States . Balki did so and became an American citizen . Balki has also mentioned Uncle Stavros many times in the series .
