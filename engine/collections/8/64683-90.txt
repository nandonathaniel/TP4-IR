The modern continental successor languages German and Dutch have preserved a few vestiges of these forms , which are sometimes termed gerundium . Frisian preserves the original distinction , e.g. West Frisian freegje ( `` ask '' ) - te freegjen English has no vestige of the West Germanic gerund . Traditional grammar uses the term gerund for the - ing form of a verb when it is used as a noun ( for example , the verb reading in the sentence `` I enjoy reading . '' ) .
