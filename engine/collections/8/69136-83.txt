When John Adams went to London in 1785 as the first representative of the United States , he found it impossible to secure a treaty for unrestricted commerce . Demands were made for favors and there was no assurance that individual states would agree to a treaty . Adams stated it was necessary for the States to confer the power of passing navigation laws to Congress , or that the States themselves pass retaliatory acts against Great Britain . Congress had already requested and failed to get power over navigation laws . Meanwhile , each State acted individually against Great Britain to little effect . When other New England states closed their ports to British shipping , Connecticut hastened to profit by opening its ports .
