Map database formats are almost uniformly proprietary , with no industry standards for satellite navigation maps , although some companies are trying to address this with SDAL and Navigation Data Standard ( NDS ) . Map data vendors such as Tele Atlas and Navteq create the base map in a GDF ( Geographic Data Files ) format , but each electronics manufacturer compiles it in an optimized , usually proprietary manner . GDF is not a CD standard for car navigation systems . GDF is used and converted onto the CD - ROM in the internal format of the navigation system . CDF ( CARiN Database Format ) is a proprietary navigation map format created by Philips .
