Blood sugar regulation is the process by which the levels of blood sugar , primarily glucose , are maintained by the body within a narrow range . This tight regulation is referred to as glucose homeostasis . Insulin , which lowers blood sugar , and glucagon , which raises it , are the most well known of the hormones involved , but more recent discoveries of other glucoregulatory hormones have expanded the understanding of this process .
