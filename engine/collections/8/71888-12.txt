One of the most significant activities that RCFP undertakes is promoting freedom of information in the United States through publishing its Open Government Guide , which reviews the open records and open meetings laws in each of the fifty states . The guide includes expert commentary by attorneys in each state who are familiar with the provisions of their state 's code as well as court rulings and informal practices that combine to affect the climate in each state for the public 's ability to obtain copies of public documents and attend government meetings .
