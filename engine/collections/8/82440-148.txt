In Japan , where baseball is inarguably the leading spectator team sport , combined revenue for the twelve teams in Nippon Professional Baseball ( NPB ) , the body that oversees both the Central and Pacific Leagues , was estimated at $1 billion in 2007 . Total NPB attendance for the year was approximately 20 million . While in the preceding two decades , MLB attendance grew by 50 percent and revenue nearly tripled , the comparable NPB figures were stagnant . There are concerns that MLB 's growing interest in acquiring star Japanese players will hurt the game in their home country . In Cuba , where baseball is by every reckoning the national sport , the national team overshadows the city and provincial teams that play in the top - level domestic leagues . Revenue figures are not released for the country 's amateur system . Similarly , according to one official pronouncement , the sport 's governing authority `` has never taken into account attendance ... because its greatest interest has always been the development of athletes '' .
