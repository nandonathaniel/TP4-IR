Controversies have erupted after six candidates for the opposition coalition , Pakatan Harapan , were disqualified from running under suspicious circumstances on Nomination Day ( Saturday 28 April 2018 ) . The most prominent disqualification was that of PKR vice-president Chua Tian Chang , who the local returning officer prevented from defending his Batu parliamentary seat due to an earlier court conviction , despite a High Court judgement which made clear he was eligible to continue as an MP . A subsequent High Court appeal was thrown out , under the claim that they did not have jurisdiction over election - related matters . Chua and his party are consequently endorsing independent candidate , 22 - year - old P. Prabakaran , for the seat .
