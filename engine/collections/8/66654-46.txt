One traditional and specialized form of qualitative research is called cognitive testing or pilot testing which is used in the development of quantitative survey items . Survey items are piloted on study participants to test the reliability and validity of the items . This approach is similar to psychological testing using an intelligence test like the WAIS ( Wechsler Adult Intelligence Survey ) in which the interviewer records `` qualitative '' ( i.e. , clinical observations ) throughout the testing process . Qualitative research is often useful in a sociological lens . Although often ignored , qualitative research is of great value to sociological studies that can shed light on the intricacies in the functionality of society and human interaction .
