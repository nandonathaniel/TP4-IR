It might be supposed from the phraseology of this provision that the right to keep and bear arms was only guaranteed to the militia ; but this would be an interpretation not warranted by the intent . The militia , as has been elsewhere explained , consists of those persons who , under the law , are liable to the performance of military duty , and are officered and enrolled for service when called upon . But the law may make provision for the enrolment of all who are fit to perform military duty , or of a small number only , or it may wholly omit to make any provision at all ; and if the right were limited to those enrolled , the purpose of this guaranty might be defeated altogether by the action or neglect to act of the government it was meant to hold in check . The meaning of the provision undoubtedly is , that the people , from whom the militia must be taken , shall have the right to keep and bear arms ; and they need no permission or regulation of law for the purpose .
