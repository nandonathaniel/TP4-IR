On January 28 , 1671 , the original city ( see Panam√° Viejo ) was destroyed by a fire when privateer Henry Morgan sacked and set fire to it . The city was formally reestablished two years later on January 21 , 1673 , on a peninsula located 8 km ( 5 miles ) from the original settlement . The site of the previously devastated city is still in ruins and is now a popular tourist attraction .
