In jaguars , the melanism allele is dominant . Consequently , black jaguars may produce either black or spotted cubs , but a pair of spotted jaguars can only produce spotted cubs . Individuals with two copies of the allele are darker ( the black background colour is more dense ) than ones with just one copy , whose background colour may appear to be dark charcoal rather than black .
