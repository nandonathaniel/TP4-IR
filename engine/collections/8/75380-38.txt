Naryanapala 's son Rajyapala ruled for at least 12 years , and constructed several public utilities and lofty temples . His son Gopala II lost Bengal after a few years of rule , and then ruled only Bihar . The next king , Vigrahapala II , had to bear the invasions from the Chandelas and the Kalachuris . During his reign , the Pala empire disintegrated into smaller kingdoms like Gauda , Radha , Anga and Vanga . Kantideva of Harikela ( eastern and southern Bengal ) also assumed the title Maharajadhiraja , and established a separate kingdom , later ruled by the Chandra dynasty . The Gauda state ( West and North Bengal ) was ruled by the Kamboja Pala dynasty . The rulers of this dynasty also bore names ending in the suffix - pala ( e.g. Rajyapala , Narayanapala and Nayapala ) . However , their origin is uncertain , and the most plausible view is that they originated from a Pala official who usurped a major part of the Pala kingdom along with its capital .
