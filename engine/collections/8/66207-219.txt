The United States of America is a federal coalition that consists of component states . Proponents of the current system argue the collective opinion of even a small state merits attention at the federal level greater than that given to a small , though numerically equivalent , portion of a very populous state . The system also allows each state the freedom , within constitutional bounds , to design its own laws on voting and enfranchisement without an undue incentive to maximize the number of votes cast .
