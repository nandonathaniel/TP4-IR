Metanoia , a transliteration of the Greek μετάνοια , can be defined as `` a transformative change of heart ; especially : a spiritual conversion . '' The term suggests repudiation , change of mind , repentance , and atonement ; but `` conversion '' and `` reformation '' may best approximate its connotation . In The King James Version of the Bible , its verbal cognate metanoeo / μετανοέω is translated as repent .
