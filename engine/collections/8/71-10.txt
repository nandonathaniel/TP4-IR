India has shown a steady average nationwide annual increase in the kilograms produced per hectare for some agricultural items , over the last 60 years . These gains have come mainly from India 's green revolution , improving road and power generation infrastructure , knowledge of gains and reforms . Despite these recent accomplishments , agriculture has the potential for major productivity and total output gains , because crop yields in India are still just 30 % to 60 % of the best sustainable crop yields achievable in the farms of developed and other developing countries . Additionally , losses after harvest due to poor infrastructure and unorganized retail cause India to experience some of the highest food losses in the world. . A new step to bring eFarming is being introduced by myKheti that serves fresh fruits and vegetables direct from Khet / Farm without storage . Because of a vast digital revolution in India , myKheti brings agriculture in a digital front through eFarming where anyone can be an online farmer and can get fresh vegetables and fruits direct from Khet / Farm .
