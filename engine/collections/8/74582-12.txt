DOMS was first described in 1902 by Theodore Hough , who concluded that this kind of soreness is `` fundamentally the result of ruptures within the muscle '' . According to this `` muscle damage '' theory of DOMS , these ruptures are microscopic lesions at the Z - line of the muscle sarcomere . The soreness has been attributed to the increased tension force and muscle lengthening from eccentric exercise . This may cause the actin and myosin cross-bridges to separate prior to relaxation , ultimately causing greater tension on the remaining active motor units . This increases the risk of broadening , smearing , and damage to the sarcomere . When microtrauma occurs to these structures , nociceptors ( pain receptors ) within muscle connective tissues are stimulated and cause the sensation of pain .
