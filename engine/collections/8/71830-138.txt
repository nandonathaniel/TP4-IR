Washington went into quarters at Morristown during the winter of 1779 -- 1780 , which represented the worst suffering for the army during the war . The temperatures fell to 16 below zero , the New York Harbor was frozen over , and snow and ice covered the ground for weeks , with the troops again lacking provisions for a time as at Valley Forge . In late 1779 , Clinton moved his forces south to Charleston for an offensive against the patriots led by Benjamin Lincoln . After his success there , Clinton returned victorious to New York , leaving Cornwallis in the south . Congress replaced Lincoln with Gates , despite Washington 's recommendation of Greene . Gates failed in South Carolina and was then replaced by Greene . The British at the time seemed to have the South almost in their grasp . Despite this news , Washington was encouraged to learn in mid-1780 that Lafayette had returned from France with additional naval assets and forces .
