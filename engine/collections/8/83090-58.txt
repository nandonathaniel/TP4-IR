The prisoners , now numbering only 7,000 , were held in the stone quarries near Syracuse , as there was no other room for them . Demosthenes and Nicias were executed , against the orders of Gylippus . The rest spent ten weeks in horrible conditions in their makeshift prison , until all but the Athenians , Italians , and Sicilians were sold as slaves . The remaining Athenians were left to die slowly of disease and starvation in the quarry . In the end some of the very last survivors managed to escape and eventually trickled to Athens , bringing first - hand news of the disaster . The specific fate of Nicias and Demosthenes is not clearly recorded in any extant source , but since they are no longer heard of , it is assumed they were executed , possibly after torture .
