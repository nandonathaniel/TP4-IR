Peter D. Mitchell proposed the chemiosmotic hypothesis in 1961 . The theory suggests essentially that most adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) synthesis in respiring cells comes from the electrochemical gradient across the inner membranes of mitochondria by using the energy of NADH and FADH formed from the breaking down of energy - rich molecules such as glucose . Mitchell won the Nobel Prize in 1976 for his chemiosmotic theory .
