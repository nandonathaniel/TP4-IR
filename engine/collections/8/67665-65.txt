The fried garnish for dal goes by many names , including chaunk , tadka and tarka . The ingredients in the chaunk for each variety of dal vary by region and individual tastes . The raw spices ( more commonly cumin seeds , mustard seeds , asafoetida , and sometimes fenugreek seeds and dried red chili pepper ) are first fried for a few seconds in the hot oil on medium / low heat . This is generally followed by ginger , garlic , and onion , which are generally fried for 10 minutes . After the onion turns golden brown , ground spices ( turmeric , coriander , red chili powder , garam masala , etc . ) are added . The chaunk is then poured over the cooked dal .
