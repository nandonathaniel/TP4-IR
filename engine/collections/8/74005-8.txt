Some confusion surrounds the British spelling of licence , which is derived from the Latin licentia , and the associated variations thereof . Licence is the only acceptable spelling of the document ( noun ) , but verbal forms of the word are spelled with an `` s '' . Licensed is used for the state of holding a licence , licensing is the correct form for the process of issuing or obtaining a licence , and licensee for a person holding a licence ( although ' driving licence holder ' is the term generally used in this context ) . In the American orthography , all variants are of the c and subsequent s form .
