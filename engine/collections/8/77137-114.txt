El Capitán ( voiced by Jim Cummings ) - El Capitán is a former captain who is insanely greedy for gold . He appeared in parts 1 , 2 , and 5 of the five - part pilot episode . Hints are given that he is in fact a 400 - year - old Spanish galleon captain who is kept alive solely by gold fever and his `` sheer willpower '' . Furthermore , he is even more of a greedy miser than Scrooge McDuck or even Flintheart Glomgold can ever be -- he sinks his own raised treasure ship by accident to retrieve a single golden coin .
