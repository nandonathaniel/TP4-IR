It seems likely this play was written after 1598 , since Francis Meres did not mention it in his Palladis Tamia . Although twelve plays are listed in Palladis Tamia , it was an incomplete inventory of Shakespeare 's plays to that date ( 1598 ) . The new Globe Theatre opened some time in the summer of 1599 , and tradition has it that the new playhouse 's motto was Totus mundus agit histrionem -- `` all the Globe 's a stage '' -- an echo of Jaques ' famous line `` All the world 's a stage '' ( II. 7 ) . This evidence posits September 1598 and September 1599 as the time frame within which the play was likely written .
