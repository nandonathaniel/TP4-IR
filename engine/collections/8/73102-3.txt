The scale was made a standard for ship 's log entries on Royal Navy vessels in the late 1830s and was adapted to non-naval use from the 1850s , with scale numbers corresponding to cup anemometer rotations . In 1916 , to accommodate the growth of steam power , the descriptions were changed to how the sea , not the sails , behaved and extended to land observations . Rotations to scale numbers were standardized only in 1923 . George Simpson , CBE ( later Sir George Simpson ) , director of the UK Meteorological Office , was responsible for this and for the addition of the land - based descriptors . The measure was slightly altered some decades later to improve its utility for meteorologists . Today , many countries have abandoned the scale and use the metric system based units , m / s or km / h , instead , but the severe weather warnings given to the public are still approximately the same as when using the Beaufort scale .
