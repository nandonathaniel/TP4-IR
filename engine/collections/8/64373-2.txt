Collective farming and communal farming are various types of `` agricultural production in which multiple farmers run their holdings as a joint enterprise . '' That type of collective is often an agricultural cooperative in which member - owners jointly engage in farming activities . The process by which farmland is aggregated ( or forcefully taken ) is called collectivization . In some countries ( including the Soviet Union , the Eastern Bloc countries , China , and Vietnam ) , there have been state - run and cooperative - run variants . For example , the Soviet Union had both kolkhozy ( cooperative - run type ) and sovkhozy ( state - run type ) , often denoted in English as collective farms and state farms , respectively .
