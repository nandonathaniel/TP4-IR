During the last scene , when Gerda and Hans are standing by Vejle Fjord , mountains are present in the background . Denmark has no mountains . The scenes were shot at the Mount Mannen in Norway and at the Isle of Sheppey in England . This historical inaccuracy was a conscious choice by the director , who later apologized to Danish people for his mistake .
