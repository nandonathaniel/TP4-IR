As a result , The Court continued to enforce a Federal laissez - faire approach , overturning many of President Franklin D. Roosevelt 's New Deal programs , which were designed to combat the Great Depression , by 5 -- 4 margins . Most notably , the National Industrial Recovery Act was overturned in Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United States ( 1935 ) , and the Agricultural Adjustment Act was struck down in United States v. Butler ( 1936 ) . In response , President Roosevelt proposed the Judiciary Reorganization Bill ( called the `` court - packing bill '' by its opponents ) , which would have increased the size of the Supreme Court and permitted the appointment of additional ( presumably pro-New Deal ) Justices . The bill , however , had many opponents , including Roosevelt 's own Vice President John Nance Garner , and was defeated in Congress .
