Acetabular anteversion . This parameter is calculated on a lateral radiograph as the angle between the transverse plane and a line going through the ( anterior and posterior ) margins of the acetabular cup . Acetabular anteversion is normally between 5 and 25 Â° . An anteversion below or above this range increases the risk of dislocation . There is an intra-individual variability in this method because the pelvis may be tilted in various degrees in relation to the transverse plane .
