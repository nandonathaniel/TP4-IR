Given the ancient origin of most vertebrate organs , researchers have looked for model systems , where organs have evolved more recently , and ideally have evolved multiple times independently . An outstanding model for this kind of research is the placenta , which has evolved more than 100 times independently in vertebrates , has evolved relatively recently in some lineages , and exists in intermediate forms in extant taxa . Studies on the evolution of the placenta have identified a variety of genetic and physiological processes that contribute to the origin and evolution of organs , these include the re-purposing of existing animal tissues , the acquiring of new functional properties to these tissues , and the novel interaction of distinct tissue types .
