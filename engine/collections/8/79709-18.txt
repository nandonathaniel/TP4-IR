The band immediately started to search for a replacement vocalist and found Howard Jones of Blood Has Been Shed . Jones disliked the band 's sound when he first heard it . He commented , `` I was like , ' Meh . ' I come from hardcore and dirtier metal , and Killswitch sounded so clean . But the more I listened to it , I realized there 's some really good songs here '' . After hearing about Leach 's vocal problems , Jones contacted the band and was accepted as the replacement . Philip Labonte of All That Remains tried out for lead vocals but lost to Jones , who had to quickly memorize seven songs for his debut at the 2002 Hellfest .
