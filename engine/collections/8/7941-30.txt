Structurally and thematically , the song is unusual in many respects . While the recorded version is 4 : 03 long , it is composed of only two verses , each with chorus . The piece is also more instrument - driven than most songs of the period , and with a much looser rhyme scheme . Its unusually allusive and referential lyrics are much more complex than most lyrics of the time ( for example , the chorus focuses on Chaucer 's `` The Miller 's Tale '' ) . Thus , this piece can be considered an early example of progressive rock .
