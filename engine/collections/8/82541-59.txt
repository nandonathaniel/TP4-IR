In 1967 , Gygax co-founded the International Federation of Wargamers ( IFW ) with Bill Speer and Scott Duncan . The IFW grew rapidly , especially by assimilating several pre-existing wargaming clubs , and aimed to promote interest in wargames of all periods . It provided a forum for wargamers , via its newsletters and societies , which enabled them to form local groups and share rules . In 1967 , Gygax organized a 20 - person gaming meet in the basement of his home ; this event would later be referred to as `` Gen Con 0 '' . In 1968 , Gygax rented Lake Geneva 's vine - covered Horticultural Hall for US $50 to hold the first Lake Geneva Convention , also known as the Gen Con gaming convention for short . Gen Con is now one of North America 's largest annual hobby - game gatherings . Gygax met Dave Arneson , the future co-creator of D&D , at the second Gen Con in August 1969 .
