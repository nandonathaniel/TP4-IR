Arab traders moved inland from the Indian Ocean coast of East Africa in the 1830s . They were followed in the 1860s by British explorers searching for the source of the Nile . British Anglican missionaries arrived in the kingdom of Buganda in 1877 ( a situation which gave rise to the death of the Uganda Martyrs ) and were followed by French Catholic missionaries in 1879 . The British government chartered the Imperial British East Africa Company ( IBEAC ) to negotiate trade agreements in the region beginning in 1888 . From 1886 , there were a series of religious wars in Buganda , initially between Muslims and Christians and then , from 1890 , between ba - Ingleza Protestants and ba - Fransa Catholics . Because of civil unrest and financial burdens , IBEAC claimed that it was unable to `` maintain their occupation '' in the region . British commercial interests were ardent to protect the trade route of the Nile , which prompted the British government to annex Buganda and adjoining territories to create the Uganda Protectorate in 1894 .
