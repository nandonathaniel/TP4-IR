Since the 1960s , there has been rising enthusiasm for historical reenactment . While the earliest groups had little claim for historical accuracy , the seriousness and accuracy of reenactors has increased . The largest such groups include The Vikings and Regia Anglorum , though many smaller groups exist in Europe , North America , New Zealand , and Australia . Many reenactor groups participate in live - steel combat , and a few have Viking - style ships or boats .
