This extension of Operation Enduring Freedom was titled OEF - HOA . Unlike other operations contained in Operation Enduring Freedom , OEF - HOA does not have a specific organization as a target . OEF - HOA instead focuses its efforts to disrupt and detect militant activities in the region and to work with willing governments to prevent the reemergence of militant cells and activities .
