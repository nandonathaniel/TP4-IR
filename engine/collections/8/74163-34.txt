Purchases of the needed properties were made through the company Hines Interests , which in at least some cases did not disclose the fact that Apple was the ultimate buyer ; Philip Mahoney , a partner with a local commercial real estate brokerage , noted that this is common practice in attempts to arrange the purchase of contiguous land made up of multiple parcels with separate owners , in order to keep costs from skyrocketing and not reveal the company 's plans to competitors . Among the sellers of the properties were SummerHill Homes ( a plot of 8 acres or 3.2 hectares ) and Hewlett - Packard ( three buildings of their campus in Cupertino ) , among others .
