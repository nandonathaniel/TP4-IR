Beginning in the late 1990s , a revival of interest in the ranch style house occurred in United States . The renewed interest in the design is mainly focused on existing houses and neighborhoods , not new construction . Younger house buyers find that ranch houses are affordable entry level homes in many markets , and the single story living of the house attracts older buyers looking for a house they can navigate easily as they age . The houses ' uniquely American heritage , being an indigenous design , has furthered interest as well . The houses ' simplicity and unpretentious nature , in marked contrast to the more dramatic and formal nature of neo-eclectic houses , makes them appealing for some buyers . The more distinctive ranch houses , such as modernist Palmer and Krisel , Joseph Eichler and Cliff May designs , as well as custom houses with a full complement of the style 's features , are in particular demand in many markets . Many neighborhoods featuring ranch - style houses are now well - established , with large trees and often with owner modifications that give these sometimes repetitive styles individual character . As these houses were mainly built in the time frame of 1945 to 1970 , they are modern in their infrastructure ; their heating / cooling systems , wiring , plumbing , windows , doors , and other systems can all be easily repaired and upgraded .
