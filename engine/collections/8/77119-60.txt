The future Queen Victoria spent childhood holidays on the island and became fond of it . When queen she made Osborne House her winter home , and so the island became a fashionable holiday resort , including for Alfred , Lord Tennyson , Julia Margaret Cameron , and Charles Dickens ( who wrote much of David Copperfield there ) , as well as the French painter Berthe Morisot and members of European royalty . Until then , the island had been rural , with most people employed in farming , fishing or boat - building . The boom in tourism , spurred by growing wealth and leisure time , and by Victoria 's example , led to significant urban development of the island 's coastal resorts .
