The first appearance of the term ' affirmative action ' was in the National Labor Relations Act , better known as the Wagner Act , of 1935 . Proposed and championed by U.S. Senator Robert F. Wagner of New York , the Wagner Act was in line with President Roosevelt 's goal of providing economic security to workers and other low - income groups . During this time period it was not uncommon for employers to blacklist or fire employees associated with unions . The Wagner Act allowed workers to unionize without fear of being discriminated against , and empowered a National Labor Relations Board to review potential cases of worker discrimination . In the event of discrimination , employees were to be restored to an appropriate status in the company through ' affirmative action ' . While the Wagner Act protected workers and unions it did not protect minorities , who , exempting the Congress of Industrial Organizations , were often barred from union ranks . This original coining of the term therefore has little to do with affirmative action policy as it is seen today , but helped set the stage for all policy meant to compensate or address an individual 's unjust treatment .
