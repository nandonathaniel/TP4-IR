In the Early Palaeozoic the Armorican terrane , which today form large parts of France , was part of either Peri-Gondwana or core Gondwana ; the Rheic Ocean closed in front of it and the Palaeo - Tethys Ocean opened behind it . Precambrian rocks from the Iberian Peninsula suggest it too probably formed part of core Gondwana before its detachment as an orocline in the Variscan orogeny close to the Carboniferous -- Permian boundary .
