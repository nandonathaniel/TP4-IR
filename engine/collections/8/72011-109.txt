In late December 2014 , NASA 's MAVEN spacecraft detected evidence of widespread auroras in Mars 's northern hemisphere and descended to approximately 20 -- 30 degrees North latitude of Mars 's equator . The particles causing the aurora penetrated into the Martian atmosphere , creating auroras below 100 km above the surface , Earth 's auroras range from 100 km to 500 km above the surface . Magnetic fields in the solar wind drape over Mars , into the atmosphere , and the charged particles follow the solar wind magnetic field lines into the atmosphere , causing auroras to occur outside the magnetic umbrellas .
