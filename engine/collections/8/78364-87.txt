When an Original Vampire dies , all of the vampires from his or her bloodline die as well . This is demonstrated when Damon , Stefan , Elena and Matt kill Finn , resulting in the deaths of Sage and Troy , ( Finn had sired Sage and Sage had sired Troy , thus creating a blood line ) . Thus , if all Original Vampires were to be killed , the entire vampire species would be rendered extinct , since all the vampires in the world are descended from the Original Vampires . However , in season 3 of the Originals , Klaus and his sireline are unlinked , meaning that if Klaus were to die , his sireline would continue to live on . It is unknown if any new Vampires that Klaus sired would be linked to him , or if they would also be unlinked , it is also unknown if Klaus ' sireline can be relinked to him again .
