The Agricultural Adjustment Act provided incentives to cut farm production in order to raise farming prices . The National Recovery Administration ( NRA ) made a number of sweeping changes to the American economy . It forced businesses to work with government to set price codes through the NRA to fight deflationary `` cut - throat competition '' by the setting of minimum prices and wages , labor standards , and competitive conditions in all industries . It encouraged unions that would raise wages , to increase the purchasing power of the working class . The NRA was deemed unconstitutional by the Supreme Court of the United States in 1935 .
