The first known intentional death from the Golden Gate Bridge occurred when the bridge was just a little over three months past its opening . In August 1937 , 47 - year - old World War I veteran Harold Wobber was employed as a bargeman and took a bus to the bridge . After he got off the bus , Wobber started down the pedestrian walkway of the 1.6 - mile span . On the way , he started talking to a college professor from Connecticut , on vacation in the San Francisco area . During the stroll , Wobber took off his coat and vest , threw them to the man , and declared , `` This is where I get off . I 'm going to jump . '' The vacationing professor grabbed the man 's belt , but Wobber was able to get free and jumped over the four foot high rail to his death in the San Francisco Bay . After his death , newspapers reported Wobber was `` a victim of shell shock '' who had been undergoing mental health treatment .
