The Furious Five defeated Tsin , but Po was suspicious and discovered they existed . Po , Tsin , and Mr. Ping armed themselves with the weevil 's only weakness , copper bowls . The weevils took over the Valley of Peace and infected Tsin . Po and Mr. Ping freed everyone , and all the weevils were subjected to the Zhu Chao Powder .
