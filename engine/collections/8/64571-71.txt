As a consequence , a notion of connectedness can be formulated independently of the topology on a space . To wit , there is a category of connective spaces consisting of sets with collections of connected subsets satisfying connectivity axioms ; their morphisms are those functions which map connected sets to connected sets ( Muscat & Buhagiar 2006 ) . Topological spaces and graphs are special cases of connective spaces ; indeed , the finite connective spaces are precisely the finite graphs .
