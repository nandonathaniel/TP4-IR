Despite these changes , the team regressed even further , as they were hampered by setbacks and injuries . On March 23 , 2010 , the Pistons were eliminated from playoff contention with a loss to the Indiana Pacers . The Pistons finished with a 27 -- 55 record . It was their worst record since 1994 . Another 50 - loss season , this time finishing at 30 -- 52 , led to the firing of Kuester at the end of the 2010 -- 11 season .
