Generally more expensive than ferrous metals , non-ferrous metals are used because of desirable properties such as low weight ( e.g. aluminium ) , higher conductivity ( e.g. copper ) , non-magnetic property or resistance to corrosion ( e.g. zinc ) . Some non-ferrous materials are also used in the iron and steel industries . For example , bauxite is used as flux for blast furnaces , while others such as wolframite , pyrolusite and chromite are used in making ferrous alloys .
