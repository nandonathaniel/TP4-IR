Climatology does serve to characterize the general properties of an average season and can be used as one of many other tools for making forecasts . Most storms form in warm waters several hundred miles north of the equator near the Intertropical convergence zone from tropical waves . The Coriolis force is usually too weak to initiate sufficient rotation near the equator . Storms frequently form in the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico , the Caribbean Sea , and the tropical Atlantic Ocean as far east as the Cape Verde Islands , the origin of strong and long - lasting Cape Verde - type hurricanes . Systems may also strengthen over the Gulf Stream off the coast of the eastern United States , wherever water temperatures exceed 26.5 ° C ( 79.7 ° F ) .
