On 12 December 1985 , Arrow Air Flight 1285 , carrying troops of the US Army 's 101st Airborne Division , stalls and crashes just seconds after taking off from Gander International Airport in Canada , killing all 256 people on board . The cause of the crash remains disputed : the Canadian Aviation Safety Board ( CASB ) concluded that ice on the wings , combined with miscalculated weight , was the cause , but a minority report claims an on - board explosion .
