Out of 437 applicants , the other three chosen for the cast of the TV show were Michael Nesmith , Peter Tork and Micky Dolenz . Nesmith had been working as a musician since early 1963 and had been recording and releasing music under various names , including Michael Blessing and `` Mike & John & Bill '' and had studied drama in college . Of the final four , Nesmith was the only one who actually saw the ad in Daily Variety and The Hollywood Reporter . Tork , the last to be chosen , had been working the Greenwich Village scene as a musician , and had shared the stage with Pete Seeger ; he learned of The Monkees from Stephen Stills , whom Rafelson and Schneider had rejected as a songwriter . Dolenz was an actor ( his father was veteran character actor George Dolenz ) who had starred in the TV series Circus Boy as a child , using the stage name Mickey Braddock , and he had also played guitar and sung in a band called the Missing Links before the Monkees , which had recorded and released a very minor single , `` Do n't Do It '' . By that time he was using his real name ; he found out about The Monkees through his agent .
