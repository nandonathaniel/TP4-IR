Within the Heathen community of the United States , gender roles are based upon perceived ideals and norms found in Early Medieval Northwestern Europe , in particular as they are presented in Old Norse sources . Among male American Heathens there is a trend toward hypermasculinized behaviour , while a gendered division of labor -- in which men are viewed as providers and women seen as being responsible for home and children -- is also widespread among Heathens in the U.S. Due to its focus on traditional attitudes to sex and gender -- values perceived as socially conservative in Western nations -- it has been argued that American Heathenry 's ethical system is far closer to traditional Christian morals than the ethical systems espoused in many other Western Pagan religions such as Wicca .
