In May 2000 , the situation on the ground had deteriorated to such an extent that British Paratroopers were deployed in Operation Palliser to evacuate foreign nationals and establish order . They stabilized the situation , and were the catalyst for a ceasefire that helped end the war . The British forces , under the command of Brigadier David Richards , expanded their original mandate , which was limited to evacuating commonwealth citizens , and now aimed to save UNAMSIL from the brink of collapse . At the time of the British intervention in May 2000 , half of the country remained under the RUF 's control . The 1,200 man British ground force -- supported by air and sea power -- shifted the balance of power in favor of the government and the rebel forces were easily repelled from the areas beyond Freetown .
