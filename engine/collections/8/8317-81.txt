In 1989 , film and stage director Ingmar Bergman staged and published a shortened reworking of the play , now entitled Nora , which entirely omitted the characters of the servants and the children , focusing more on the power struggle between Nora and Torvald . It was widely viewed as downplaying the feminist themes of Ibsen 's original . The first staging of it in New York was reviewed by the Times as heightening the play 's melodramatic aspects . The Los Angeles Times stated that `` Nora shores up A Doll 's House in some areas but weakens it in others . ''
