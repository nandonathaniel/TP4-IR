Robert Plutchik agreed with Ekman 's biologically driven perspective but developed the `` wheel of emotions '' , suggesting eight primary emotions grouped on a positive or negative basis : joy versus sadness ; anger versus fear ; trust versus disgust ; and surprise versus anticipation . Some basic emotions can be modified to form complex emotions . The complex emotions could arise from cultural conditioning or association combined with the basic emotions . Alternatively , similar to the way primary colors combine , primary emotions could blend to form the full spectrum of human emotional experience . For example , interpersonal anger and disgust could blend to form contempt . Relationships exist between basic emotions , resulting in positive or negative influences .
