He wrote two hymns on the Ten Commandments , `` Dies sind die heilgen Zehn Gebot '' and `` Mensch , willst du leben seliglich '' . His `` Gelobet seist du , Jesu Christ '' ( `` Praise be to You , Jesus Christ '' ) became the main hymn for Christmas . He wrote for Pentecost `` Nun bitten wir den Heiligen Geist '' , and adopted for Easter `` Christ ist erstanden '' ( Christ is risen ) , based on Victimae paschali laudes . `` Mit Fried und Freud ich fahr dahin '' , a paraphrase of Nunc dimittis , was intended for Purification , but became also a funeral hymn . He paraphrased the Te Deum as `` Herr Gott , dich loben wir '' with a simplified form of the melody . It became known as the German Te Deum .
