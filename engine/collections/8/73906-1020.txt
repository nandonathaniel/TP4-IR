Commander Vachir is the chief of security at Chorh - Gom Prison , and the leader of the Anvil of Heaven , a one thousand - strong army of elite battle rhinos . He was placed in charge of the prison at the recommendation of Master Flying Rhino . Vachir has a ruby horn - shaped cap in place of his nose horn , as a decorative prosthetic . Before Tai Lung 's incarceration , the Anvil of Heaven opposed tyranny and injustice throughout China , and were notorious for their fearlessness and terrifying fighting skills . Vachir was charged with the construction of Chorh - Gom Prison , and he oversaw Tai Lung 's imprisonment for twenty years . Overconfident of the prison 's security , Vachir greatly underestimated Tai Lung 's potential and failed to stop him from escaping and was caught in an explosion along with many of his troops and is seen falling off a cliff . Although his horn - shaped cap was seen amongst the ruins , it is unknown if Commander Vachir survived or not .
