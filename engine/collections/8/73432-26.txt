Just before Christmas 1945 , Vito is severely wounded in an assassination attempt by drug kingpin Virgil Sollozzo , throwing Michael into the middle of the Mafia world he had for so long avoided . Michael reaffirms his loyalty at his father 's bedside , then calls Sonny and prevents Sollozzo 's second attempt on Vito 's life . Captain McCluskey , a corrupt NYPD officer on Sollozzo 's payroll , breaks Michael 's jaw . Sonny then orders Bruno Tattaglia , son and underboss of Sollozzo 's ally Philip Tattaglia , to be murdered . Sollozzo proposes that Michael to be sent to broker a truce but Sonny believing its a trick refuses and demands that the other Mafia families hand over Sollozzo to the Corleone family or else face war . Michael suggests they agree to Sollozzo 's meeting but insists its a public place with people where he will murder Sollozzo and McCluskey . Corleone consigliere Tom Hagen warns Sonny that killing McCluskey would violate a long - standing Mafia rule not to kill members of law enforcement and the backlash from rival Mafia families and law enforcement would be severe . Michael successfully argues that McCluskey is fair game because he is a corrupt cop mixed up in the drug trade and serving as Sollozzo 's bodyguard . Sonny agrees and approves the hit .
