As the decomposition of N O into oxygen and nitrogen gas is exothermic and thus contributes to a higher temperature in the combustion engine , the decomposition increases engine efficiency and performance , which is directly related to the difference in temperature between the unburned fuel mixture and the hot combustion gasses produced in the cylinders .
