These statistics compare 2005 with 2000 when No Child Left Behind did n't even take effect until 2003 . They point out that the increase in scores between 2000 and 2005 was roughly the same as the increase between 2003 and 2005 , which calls into question how any increase can be attributed to No Child Left Behind . They also argue that some of the subgroups are cherry - picked -- that in other subgroups scores remained the same or fell . Also , the makers of the standardized tests have been blamed for making the tests easier so that it is easier for schools to sufficiently improve .
