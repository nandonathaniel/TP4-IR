The royal family dominates the political system . The family 's vast numbers allow it to control most of the kingdom 's important posts and to have an involvement and presence at all levels of government . The number of princes is estimated to be at least 7,000 , with most power and influence being wielded by the 200 or so male descendants of Ibn Saud . The key ministries are generally reserved for the royal family , as are the thirteen regional governorships .
