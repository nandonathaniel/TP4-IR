Fab and F ( ab ' ) 2 antibody fragments are used in assay systems where the presence of the Fc region may cause problems . In tissues such as lymph nodes or spleen , or in peripheral blood preparations , cells with Fc receptors ( macrophages , monocytes , B lymphocytes , and natural killer cells ) are present which can bind the Fc region of intact antibodies , causing background staining in areas that do not contain the target antigen . Use of F ( ab ' ) 2 or Fab fragments ensures that the antibodies are binding to the antigen and not Fc receptors . These fragments may also be desirable for staining cell preparations in the presence of plasma , because they are not able to bind complement , which could lyse the cells . F ( ab ' ) 2 , and to a greater extent Fab , fragments allow more exact localization of the target antigen , i.e. , in staining tissue for electron microscopy . The divalency of the F ( ab ' ) 2 fragment enables it to cross-link antigens , allowing use for precipitation assays , cellular aggregation via surface antigens , or rosetting assays .
