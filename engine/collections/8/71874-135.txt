Consensual sexual intercourse over the 3 - year age difference ( where the minor is 13 to 15 years old ) would subject the older party to a charge of Sexual Assault , 2nd Degree , in violation of C.G.S. ยง 53a - 71 ( a ) ( 1 ) . Any juvenile offender 14 years old or older has the case automatically transferred to the regular criminal docket of the Superior Court by operation of law , and thus stands before the court to be tried as an adult . See C.G.S. ยง 46b - 127 ( a ) . A guilty verdict would result in conviction of a Class B felony sex offense , with a mandatory minimum of 9 months and maximum 20 years imprisonment . It would not matter if the older person did not know of the age difference , or if the younger person lied about age . However , if the offender is 17 years old or younger , has a clean record , and such sexual activity was consensual , Youthful Offender status ( a pre-trial diversionary program that seals the court record and results in a dismissal of charges ) may be granted . See C.G.S. ยง 54 - 76b to o .
