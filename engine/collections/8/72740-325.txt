Ren√© Descartes believed that the total `` quantity of motion '' ( Latin : quantitas motus ) in the universe is conserved , where the quantity of motion is understood as the product of size and speed . This should not be read as a statement of the modern law of momentum , since he had no concept of mass as distinct from weight and size , and more importantly he believed that it is speed rather than velocity that is conserved . So for Descartes if a moving object were to bounce off a surface , changing its direction but not its speed , there would be no change in its quantity of motion . Galileo , in his Two New Sciences , used the Italian word impeto to similarly describe Descarte 's quantity of motion .
