Medical hand - washing is for a minimum of 15 seconds , using generous amounts of soap and water or gel to lather and rub each part of the hands . Hands should be rubbed together with digits interlocking . If there is debris under fingernails , a bristle brush may be used to remove it . Since germs may remain in the water on the hands , it is important to rinse well and wipe dry with a clean towel . After drying , the paper towel should be used to turn off the water ( and open any exit door if necessary ) . This avoids re-contaminating the hands from those surfaces .
