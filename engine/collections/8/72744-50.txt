Laura Miller of Salon.com finds Katniss too virtuous and without motivation , negatively contrasting Katniss to Bella of Twilight , saying , `` In some ways , Katniss is more passive than Bella , allowed to have all kinds of goodies but only if she demonstrates her virtue by not really wanting them in the first place , '' and , `` For all her irritating flaws , Bella , at least , has the courage of her desire . For what , besides a well - earned vengeance , does Katniss Everdeen truly hunger ? '' However , Miller did think that she was `` in many respects an improvement on ... Bella '' . However , The Daily Telegraph 's David Gritten labelled her `` a great role model for girls '' who `` has love interests , but does n't mope passively over boys '' .
