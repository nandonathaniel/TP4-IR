Water balloons are thin , small rubber balloons filled with a liquid , usually water , instead of a gas , and intended to be easily broken . They are usually used by children , who throw them at each other , trying to get each other wet , as a game , competition , or practical joke . By forcing water out the open end of a water balloon , it is possible to use it as a makeshift water gun .
