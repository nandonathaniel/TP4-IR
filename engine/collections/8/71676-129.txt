Alchemy ( the operation of the Sun ) : Alchemy is not merely the changing of lead into gold . It is an investigation into the spiritual constitution , or life , of matter and material existence through an application of the mysteries of birth , death , and resurrection . The various stages of chemical distillation and fermentation , among other processes , are aspects of these mysteries that , when applied , quicken nature 's processes in order to bring a natural body to perfection . This perfection is the accomplishment of the magnum opus ( Latin for `` Great Work '' ) .
