Manessier 's Continuation ( also called the Third Continuation , because that is its place in the manuscripts that do not include Gerbert ) added 10,000 lines and , at last , an ending . Manessier wrapped up many of the loose ends from the previous authors , and includes several episodes from other works , including the `` Joie de la Cour '' adventure from Chr√©tien 's Erec and Enide and Calogrenant 's death as told in the Queste del Saint Graal section of the Lancelot - Grail cycle . The tale ends with the Fisher King 's death and Perceval 's ascension to his throne . After seven peaceful years , Perceval goes off to live as a hermit in the woods , where he dies shortly after . Manessier supposes he took the Grail , the Lance , and the silver plate with him to Heaven .
