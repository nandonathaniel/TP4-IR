Markov processes are stochastic processes , traditionally in discrete or continuous time , that have the Markov property , which means the next value of the Markov process depends on the current value , but it is conditionally independent of the previous values of the stochastic process . In other words , the behavior of the process in the future is stochastically independent of its behavior in the past , given the current state of the process .
