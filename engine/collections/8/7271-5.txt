Originally , the full name was `` hashed brown potatoes '' ( or `` hashed browned potatoes '' ) , of which the first known mention is by American food author Maria Parloa ( 1843 -- 1909 ) in 1888 . The name was gradually shortened to ' hash brown potatoes ' . Bite sized Hash Browns are small cylindrical dumplings , known as Tater Tots in the U.S. and Potato Gems in Australia , and are sold commercially at diners and in frozen food aisles in packets .
