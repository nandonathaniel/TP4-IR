In 1989 the Voyager 2 spacecraft observed cryovolcanoes ( ice volcanoes ) on Triton , a moon of Neptune , and in 2005 the Cassini -- Huygens probe photographed fountains of frozen particles erupting from Enceladus , a moon of Saturn . The ejecta may be composed of water , liquid nitrogen , ammonia , dust , or methane compounds . Cassini -- Huygens also found evidence of a methane - spewing cryovolcano on the Saturnian moon Titan , which is believed to be a significant source of the methane found in its atmosphere . It is theorized that cryovolcanism may also be present on the Kuiper Belt Object Quaoar .
