Traditional stories handed down by the ancient Romans themselves explain the earliest history of their city in terms of legend and myth . The most familiar of these myths , and perhaps the most famous of all Roman myths , is the story of Romulus and Remus , the twins who were suckled by a she - wolf . They decided to build a city , but after an argument , Romulus killed his brother and the city took his name . According to the Roman annalists , this happened on 21 April 753 BC . This legend had to be reconciled with a dual tradition , set earlier in time , that had the Trojan refugee Aeneas escape to Italy and found the line of Romans through his son Iulus , the namesake of the Julio - Claudian dynasty . This was accomplished by the Roman poet Virgil in the first century BC .
