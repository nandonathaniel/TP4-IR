Ingrid Bergman as Ilsa Lund . Bergman 's official website calls Ilsa her `` most famous and enduring role '' . The Swedish actress 's Hollywood debut in Intermezzo had been well received , but her subsequent films were not major successes until Casablanca . Film critic Roger Ebert called her `` luminous '' , and commented on the chemistry between her and Bogart : `` she paints his face with her eyes '' . Other actresses considered for the role of Ilsa included Ann Sheridan , Hedy Lamarr , Luise Rainer and Mich√®le Morgan . Producer Hal Wallis obtained the services of Bergman , who was contracted to David O. Selznick , by lending Olivia de Havilland in exchange .
