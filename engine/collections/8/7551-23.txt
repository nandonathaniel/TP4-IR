Fish , like many other organisms , have been greatly affected by extinction events throughout natural history . The Ordovician -- Silurian extinction events led to the loss of many species . The late Devonian extinction led to the extinction of the ostracoderms and placoderms by the end of the Devonian , as well as other fish . The spiny sharks became extinct at the Permian -- Triassic extinction event ; the conodonts became extinct at the Triassic -- Jurassic extinction event . The Cretaceous -- Paleogene extinction event , and the present day Holocene extinction , have also affected fish variety and fish stocks .
