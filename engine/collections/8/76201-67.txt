Siblicide can also be seen in humans in the form of twins in the mother 's womb . One twin may grow to be an average weight , while the other is underweight . This is a result of one twin taking more nutrients from the mother than the other twin . In cases of identical twins , they may even have Twin to Twin Transfusion Syndrome ( TTTS ) . This means that the twins share the same placenta and blood and nutrients can then move between twins . The twins may also be suffering from Intrauterine Growth Restriction ( IUGR ) , meaning that there is not enough room for both of the twins to grow . All of these factors can limit the growth of one of the twins while promoting the growth of the other . While one of the twins may not die because of these factors , it is entirely possible that their health will be compromised and lead to complications after their birth .
