Bolshevik leaders had effectively reestablished a polity with roughly the same extent as that empire by 1921 , however with an internationalist ideology : Lenin in particular asserted the right to limited self - determination for national minorities within the new territory . Beginning in 1923 , the policy of `` Indigenization '' ( korenizatsiia ) was intended to support non-Russians develop their national cultures within a socialist framework . Never formally revoked , it stopped being implemented after 1932 . After World War II , the Soviet Union installed socialist regimes modeled on those it had installed in 1919 -- 20 in the old Tsarist Empire in areas its forces occupied in Eastern Europe . The Soviet Union and the People 's Republic of China supported post -- World War II communist movements in foreign nations and colonies to advance their own interests , but were not always successful .
