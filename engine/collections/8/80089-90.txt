The process by which the show is written has changed as the show progressed . In the first season , Burnie Burns would typically write an episode script on a Sunday afternoon before the episode was to be released on Friday . Scripts were written with minimal planning as the storyline grew beyond the 6 to 8 episodes originally expected . Church 's death , as well as the revelation of Tex as a female character , both of which drove most of the season 1 plot , were conceived shortly before their respective episodes began production .
