In 2013 : The State Fair opened a brand new attraction -- a 500 - foot observation tower called `` Top o ' Texas Tower '' -- as part of a renovation of part of the Midway called `` Summer Adventures at Fair Park . '' The `` Tower '' now operates only 24 days a year , despite a construction cost of over $11,000,000 . The State Fair also operated Summer Adventures in Fair Park , a beach - themed amusement park from May to August 2013 . Despite a $30,000,000 investment in Summer Adventures , the event was shuttered after just one season . Jim Schutze of the Dallas Observer wrote , `` The sudden collapse of a $30 million venture has to be some kind of red flag , some indication that it 's time to re-examine the whole thing . '' A new Big Tex statue was unveiled the day before the fair opened .
