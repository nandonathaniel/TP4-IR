Daft Punk continued to wear the robot costumes in their live performances at the 2008 , 2014 and 2017 Grammy Awards , with variations in clothing . During the 2014 ceremony , they also accepted their awards on stage in the outfits , with Pharrell and Paul Williams speaking on the duo 's behalf . At the time , the decision to stay in costume drew criticism from viewers on Twitter , including future White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer . In both their appearance at the 2017 Grammy Awards and in the Weeknd 's `` I Feel It Coming '' music video , the duo wore long black capes and chrome - plated gloves along with their customary helmets .
