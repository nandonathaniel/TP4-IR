Some reviewers compared Philosopher 's Stone to the stories of Roald Dahl , who died in 1990 . Many writers since the 1970s had been hailed as his successor , but none had attained anything near his popularity with children and , in a poll conducted shortly after the launch of Philosopher 's Stone , seven of the ten most popular children 's books were by Dahl , including the one in top place . The only other really popular children 's author of the late 1990s was an American , R.L. Stine . Some of the story elements in Philosopher 's Stone resembled parts of Dahl 's stories ; for example , the hero of James and the Giant Peach lost his parents and had to live with a pair of unpleasant aunts‍ -- ‌one fat and one thin rather like Mr. and Mrs. Dursley , who treated Harry as a servant . However Harry Potter was a distinctive creation , able to take on the responsibilities of an adult while remaining a child inside .
