A number of dominant players of their eras have failed to achieve the Career Grand Slam because of their inability to win a particular major . Sam Snead and Phil Mickelson ( through 2017 ) failed to win a U.S. Open ; Arnold Palmer , Tom Watson , and Jordan Spieth ( through 2017 ) failed to win a PGA Championship ; Lee Trevino and Rory McIlroy ( through 2018 ) failed to win The Masters ; Byron Nelson and Raymond Floyd failed to win the Open Championship , at which the former competed only once . These shortcomings have been attributed to various factors : a particular major is ill - suited to a player 's game ( this was cited especially with regard to Trevino and The Masters ) ; the player lacked the ability to fully adapt to that major ; the player simply experienced bad luck ( Mickelson finished second a record six times at the U.S. Open ) ; or war had led to the cancellation of a major during the player 's prime .
