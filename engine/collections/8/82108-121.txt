On 1 December 1830 , King Louis - Philippe named the Duc de Rovigo as head of military staff in Algeria . De Rogivo took control of Bône and initiated colonisation of the land . He was recalled in 1833 due to the overtly violent nature of the repression . Wishing to avoid a conflict with Morocco , Louis - Philippe sent an extraordinary mission to the Sultan , mixed with displays of military might , sending war ships to the bay of Tangiers . An ambassador was sent to the Sultan Moulay Abderrahmane in February 1832 , headed by the Count of Mornay and including the painter Eugène Delacroix . The Sultan , however , refused French demands to evacuate Tlemcen .
