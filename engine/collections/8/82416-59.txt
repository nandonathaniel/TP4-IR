On 19 July 2014 , Russia announced that they launched their Foton - M4 satellite into low earth orbit ( 575 kilometers ) with 1 male and 4 female geckos ( possibly gold dust day geckos ) as the payload . This was an effort to study the effects of microgravity on reproductive habits of reptiles . On 24 July 2014 , it was announced that Russia had lost control of the Foton - M4 satellite , leaving only two months to restore contact before the geckos ' food supply was exhausted . Control of the satellite was subsequently restored on 28 July 2014 . On 1 September 2014 Russia confirmed the death of all five geckos , stating that their mummified bodies seem to indicate they froze to death . Russia is said to have appointed an emergency commission to investigate the animals ' deaths .
