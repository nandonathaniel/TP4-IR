This was different in quality from the repressions of Jews which had occurred in ancient times . Ancient repressions were politically motivated and Jews were treated the same as members of other ethnic groups . With the rise of the Churches , the main motive for attacks on Jews changed from politics to religion and the religious motive for such attacks was specifically derived from Christian views about Jews and Judaism . During the Middle Ages , Jewish people who lived under Muslim rule generally experienced tolerance and integration , but there were occasional outbreaks of violence like Almohad 's persecutions .
