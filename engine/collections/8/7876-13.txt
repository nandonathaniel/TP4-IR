Vitamin K is a group of structurally similar , fat - soluble vitamins that the human body requires for complete synthesis of certain proteins that are prerequisites for blood coagulation ( K from Koagulation , Danish for `` coagulation '' ) and which the body also needs for controlling binding of calcium in bones and other tissues . The vitamin K - related modification of the proteins allows them to bind calcium ions , which they can not do otherwise . Without vitamin K , blood coagulation is seriously impaired , and uncontrolled bleeding occurs . Preliminary clinical research indicates that deficiency of vitamin K may weaken bones , potentially leading to osteoporosis , and may promote calcification of arteries and other soft tissues .
