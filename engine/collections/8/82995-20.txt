In the 1939 cartoon Dangerous Dan McFoo , a new voice actor , Arthur Q. Bryan , was hired to provide the voice of the hero dog character . It was in this cartoon that the popular `` milk - sop '' voice of Elmer Fudd was created . Elmer Fudd has since been the chief antagonistic force in the majority of the Bugs Bunny cartoons , initiating one of the most famous rivalries in the history of American cinema . Barrier notes , `` Elmer Fudd was not a modified version of his fellow Warner Bros. character Egghead '' and that `` the two characters were always distinct . That was evidenced ... by Elmer 's being identified in a Warner publicity sheet for Cinderella Meets Fella ( filed with the Library of Congress as a copyright description ) as ' Egghead 's brother .
