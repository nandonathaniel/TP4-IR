The Guantanamo Bay detention camp is a United States military prison located within Guantanamo Bay Naval Base , also referred to as Guantánamo or GTMO ( / ˈɡɪtmoʊ / ) , which is on the coast of Guantánamo Bay in Cuba . Since the inmates have been detained indefinitely without trial and several detainees have alleged torture , the operations of this camp are considered to be a major breach of human rights by Amnesty International .
