During November 2011 , the Google+ social networking site was integrated directly with YouTube and the Chrome web browser , allowing YouTube videos to be viewed from within the Google+ interface . In December 2011 , YouTube launched a new version of the site interface , with the video channels displayed in a central column on the home page , similar to the news feeds of social networking sites . At the same time , a new version of the YouTube logo was introduced with a darker shade of red , which was the first change in design since October 2006 .
