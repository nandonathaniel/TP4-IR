The dower grew out of the Germanic practice of bride price ( Old English weotuma ) , which was given over to a bride 's family well in advance for arranging the marriage , but during the early Middle Ages , was given directly to the bride instead . However , in popular parlance , the term may be used for a life interest in property settled by a husband on his wife at any time , not just at the wedding . The verb to dower is sometimes used .
