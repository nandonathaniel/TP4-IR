After 1747 , some Virginians began to attend institutions at Princeton and Philadelphia . Generations began to move west into the Piedmont and Blue Ridge areas . It is in this region of Virginia that two future Presbyterian colleges trace their origins to lower level institutions founded in this time period . First , what would become Hampden -- Sydney College was founded in 1775 , immediately prior to the American Revolution . Likewise , Augusta Academy was a classical school that would evolve into Washington and Lee University ( though would not grant its first bachelor 's degree until 1785 ) .
