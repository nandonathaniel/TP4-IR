Holden 's second full - scale car factory , located in Fishermans Bend ( Port Melbourne ) , was completed in 1936 , with construction beginning in 1939 on a new plant in Pagewood , New South Wales . However , World War II delayed car production with efforts shifted to the construction of vehicle bodies , field guns , aircraft and engines . Before the war ended , the Australian Government took steps to encourage an Australian automotive industry . Both GM and Ford provided studies to the Australian Government outlining the production of the first Australian - designed car . Ford 's proposal was the government 's first choice , but required substantial financial assistance . GM 's study was ultimately chosen because of its low level of government intervention . After the war , Holden returned to producing vehicle bodies , this time for Buick , Chevrolet , Pontiac and Vauxhall . The Oldsmobile Ace was also produced from 1946 to 1948 .
