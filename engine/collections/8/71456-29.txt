Closed - loop engine control systems are necessary for effective operation of three - way catalytic converters because of the continuous balancing required for effective NO reduction and HC oxidation . The control system must prevent the NO reduction catalyst from becoming fully oxidized , yet replenish the oxygen storage material so that its function as an oxidation catalyst is maintained .
