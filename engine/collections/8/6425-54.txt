D.J. is typically the daughter who acts the most practical , often giving advice to her younger sisters , Michelle and Stephanie . Although she sometimes bickers with them , she cares for them deeply . As D.J. entered into middle school , she started to deal with more serious issues like puberty and dating . She has her first serious relationship with Steve Hale ( who was first introduced in the season five episode `` Sisters in Crime '' ) , who later becomes a real fixture in her life ( and a regular character beginning in season six ) when their characters return from a summer abroad in Spain . Their relationship lasts until they break up in the season seven episode `` Love on the Rocks , '' when they realize that the passion in their relationship is gone , but they agree to remain friends . D.J. has on - and - off relationships ( during the show 's final season ) with guitarist Viper ( a member of Jesse 's new band Hot Daddy and the Monkey Puppets ) and rich kid Nelson , but both relationships do not last ( the two end up vying for D.J. 's affections in the season eight episode `` D.J. 's Choice , '' only for D.J. to reject them both after their fighting gets to be too much for her to bear ) . In the series finale `` Michelle Rides Again , '' Steve shows up at the Tanner house to take D.J. to her senior prom and they share a kiss . Her best friend throughout the show was next - door neighbor Kimmy Gibbler , who was the complete opposite of D.J. in every way . In season eight , D.J. gets accepted to University of California , Berkeley and it is implied she will go to college there after graduating high school ( after she was rejected from her first choice , Stanford University ) .
