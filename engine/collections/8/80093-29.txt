The song 's melody was inspired by the timeless figure of Elvis Presley , with Hammond imagining it as being sung by Presley at the opening of the Olympics . It appeared on the album 1988 Summer Olympics Album : One Moment in Time , produced in conjunction with NBC Sports ' coverage of the Seoul games and which , in addition to Whitney Houston who sang it live at the main ceremony , also featured artists such as : The Four Tops , The Bee Gees , Eric Carmen , Taylor Dayne and the film composer John Williams . The track is an anthem for believing in yourself against all odds as Houston asks for `` One moment in time / when I 'm racing with destiny / Then , in that one moment of time , I will feel eternity .
