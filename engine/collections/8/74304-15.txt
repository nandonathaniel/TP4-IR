The remainder of the story describes their river journey and the incidents that occur . The book 's original purpose as a guidebook is apparent as J. , the narrator , describes passing landmarks and villages such as Hampton Court Palace , Hampton Church , Magna Carta Island and Monkey Island , and muses on historical associations of these places . However , he frequently digresses into humorous anecdotes that range from the unreliability of barometers for weather forecasting to the difficulties encountered when learning to play the Scottish bagpipes . The most frequent topics of J. 's anecdotes are river pastimes such as fishing and boating and the difficulties they present to the inexperienced and unwary and to the three men on previous boating trips .
