At the start of November 2016 , Reed said that the film 's production would transition from `` the writing phase '' to `` official prep '' that month , beginning with visual development . Reed reiterated his excitement for introducing the Wasp and `` really designing her look , the way she moves , the power set , and figuring out , sort of , who Hope van Dyne is as a hero '' . He also talked about sharing characters with other MCU films , stating his disappointment in the Giant - Man introduction happening in Civil War , rather than an Ant - Man film . Reed added that he spends `` a lot of time '' talking with the other writers and directors of MCU films , and that he and the writers on this film wished to maintain `` our little Ant - Man corner of the universe . Because it 's a whole different vibe tonally '' .
