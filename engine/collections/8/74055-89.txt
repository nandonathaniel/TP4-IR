From 1939 to 1964 , CBS Television occupied a large portion of the terminal building , particularly above the main waiting room . The space contained two production studios ( 41 and 42 ) , two `` program control '' facilities ( 43 and 44 ) , network master control , and facilities for local station WCBS - TV . In 1958 , the first major videotape operations facility in the world opened in a former rehearsal room on the seventh floor of the main terminal building . The facility used fourteen Ampex VR - 1000 videotape recorders . The CBS Evening News began its broadcasts there with Douglas Edwards . Many historic news events were broadcast from this location , such as John Glenn 's Mercury - Atlas 6 space mission . Edward R. Murrow 's `` See It Now '' originated from Grand Central , including his famous broadcasts on Senator Joseph McCarthy . The Murrow broadcasts were recreated in George Clooney 's movie Good Night , and Good Luck , although the CBS News and corporate offices were not actually in the same building as the film implies . The long - running panel show `` What 's My Line ? '' was first broadcast from the GCT studios , as were `` The Goldbergs '' and `` Mama '' . The facility 's operations were later moved to the CBS Broadcast Center .
