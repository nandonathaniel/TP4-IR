Great Britain and the United States were rivals for influence in the newly independent sovereign nations . As a result of the successful revolutions which established so many new independent nations , United States President James Monroe and the Secretary of State John Quincy Adams drafted the Monroe Doctrine . It stated that the United States would not tolerate any European interference in the Western Hemisphere . This measure ostensibly was taken in order to safeguard the newfound liberties of these new countries , but it was also taken as a precautionary measure against the intrusion of European states . Since the United States was a newly founded nation , it lacked the capacity to prevent other European powers from interfering , for that the United States looked for Britain 's help and support to execute the Monroe Doctrine into action .
