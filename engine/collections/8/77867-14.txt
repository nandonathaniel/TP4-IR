Alternate set - ups may use a multi -- outlet distillation receiver flask ( referred to as a `` cow '' or `` pig '' ) to connect three or four receiving flasks to the condenser . By turning the cow or pig , the distillates can be channeled into any chosen receiver . Because the receiver does not have to be removed and replaced during the distillation process , this type of apparatus is useful when distilling under an inert atmosphere for air - sensitive chemicals or at reduced pressure . A Perkin triangle is an alternative apparatus often used in these situations because it allows isolation of the receiver from the rest of the system , but does require removing and reattaching a single receiver for each fraction .
