The area and populations of the regions vary widely ; for example , the Capital Region , which encompasses the Copenhagen metropolitan area with the exception of the subtracted province East Zeeland but includes the Baltic Sea island of Bornholm , has a population three times larger than that of North Denmark Region , which covers the more sparsely populated area of northern Jutland . Under the county system certain densely populated municipalities , such as Copenhagen Municipality and Frederiksberg , had been given a status equivalent to that of counties , making them first - level administrative divisions . These sui generis municipalities were incorporated into the new regions under the 2007 reforms .
