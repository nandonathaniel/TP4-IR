Early Hebrew views were more concerned with the fate of the nation of Israel as a whole , rather than with individual immortality . A stronger belief in an afterlife for each person developed during the Second Temple period but was contested by various Jewish sects . Pharisees believed that in death , people rest in their graves until they are physically resurrected with the coming of the Messiah , and within that resurrected body the soul would exist eternally . Maimonides also included the concept of resurrection in his Thirteen Principles of Faith .
