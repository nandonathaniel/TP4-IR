Understanding traits of individual organisms helps explain patterns and processes at other levels of organization including populations , communities , and ecosystems . Several areas of ecology of evolution that focus on such traits are life history theory , ecophysiology , metabolic theory of ecology , and Ethology . Examples of such traits include features of an organisms life cycle such as age to maturity , life span , or metabolic costs of reproduction . Other traits may be related to structure , such as the spines of a cactus or dorsal spines of a bluegill sunfish , or behaviors such as courtship displays or pair bonding . Other traits include emergent properties that are the result at least in part of interactions with the surrounding environment such as growth rate , resource uptake rate , winter , and deciduous vs. drought deciduous trees and shrubs .
