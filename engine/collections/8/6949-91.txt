Towards the end of the campaign , Messi scored in a 1 -- 0 away win over Atlético Madrid on 17 May , securing the La Liga title . Among his 43 league goals that season was a hat - trick scored in 11 minutes against Rayo Vallecano on 8 March , the fastest of his senior career ; it was his 32nd hat - trick overall for Barcelona , allowing him to overtake Telmo Zarra as the player with the most hat - tricks ever in Spanish football . Additionally , as the season 's top assist provider with 18 assists , he surpassed Luís Figo as the player with the most assists in La Liga ; he made his record 106th assist in a fixture against Levante on 15 February , in which he also scored a hat - trick . Messi then scored twice as Barcelona defeated Athletic Bilbao 3 -- 1 in the Copa del Rey final on 30 May , achieving the sixth double in their history . His opening goal was hailed as one of the greatest in his career ; he collected the ball near the halfway line and beat four opposing players , before feinting the goalkeeper to score in a tight space by the near post . The goal was later named one of the three final nominees for the 2015 FIFA Puskás Award .
