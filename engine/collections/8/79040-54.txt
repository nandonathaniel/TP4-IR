As a young man , he rose through the ranks of the Roman army , serving in some of the most contested parts of the Empire 's frontier . In 76 -- 77 , Trajan 's father was Governor of Syria ( Legatus pro praetore Syriae ) , where Trajan himself remained as Tribunus legionis . From there , after his father 's replacement , he seems to have been transferred to an unspecified Rhine province , and Pliny implies that he engaged in active combat duty during both commissions . In about 86 , Trajan 's cousin P. Aelius Afer died , leaving his young children Hadrian and Paulina orphans . Trajan and a colleague of his , Publius Acilius Attianus , became co-guardians of the two children .
