Breeders would choose potential exhibition ducks from among newly hatched ducklings in March and April , and they would be given a great deal of extra attention . They would be fed a carefully controlled diet to get them to the maximum weight , and would be allowed out for a few hours each day to keep them in as good a physical condition as possible . Before the show , their legs and feet would be washed , their bills trimmed with a knife and sandpapered smooth , and their feathers brushed with linseed oil . While most breeders would give the ducks a healthy meal before the show to calm them , some breeders would force - feed the ducks with sausage or worms , to get them to as heavy a weight as possible . Exhibition standards judged an Aylesbury duck primarily on size , shape and colour . This encouraged the breeding of larger ducks , with pronounced exaggerated keels , and loose baggy skin . By the beginning of the 20th century the Aylesbury duck had diverged into two separate strains , one bred for appearance and one for meat .
