Despite these experiments , Lavoisier 's antiphlogistic approach remained unaccepted by many other chemists . Lavoisier labored to provide definitive proof of the composition of water , attempting to use this in support of his theory . Working with Jean - Baptiste Meusnier , Lavoisier passed water through a red - hot iron gun barrel , allowing the oxygen to form an oxide with the iron and the hydrogen to emerge from the end of the pipe . He submitted his findings of the composition of water to the Acad√©mie des Sciences in April 1784 , reporting his figures to eight decimal places . Opposition responded to this further experimentation by stating that Lavoisier continued to draw the incorrect conclusions , and that his experiment demonstrated the displacement of phlogiston from iron by the combination of water with the metal . Lavoisier developed a new apparatus which utilized a pneumatic trough , a set of balances , a thermometer , and a barometer , all calibrated carefully . Thirty savants were invited to witness the decomposition and synthesis of water using this apparatus , convincing many who attended of the correctness of Lavoisier 's theories . This demonstration established water as a compound of oxygen and hydrogen with great certainty for those who viewed it . The dissemination of the experiment , however , proved subpar , as it lacked the details to properly display the amount of precision taken in the measurements . The paper ended with a hasty statement that the experiment was `` more than sufficient to lay hold of the certainty of the proposition '' of the composition of water and stated that the methods used in the experiment would unite chemistry with the other physical sciences and advance discoveries .
