Nine - tenths of the current area is artificial island that did not exist at the time of the interstate compact . New Jersey contended that the new extensions were part of New Jersey , since they were outside New York 's border and were in fact within New Jersey 's border . In 1956 , after the 1954 closing of the U.S. immigration station , the then Mayor of Jersey City , Bernard J. Berry , commandeered a U.S. Coast Guard cutter and led a contingent of New Jersey officials on an expedition to claim the island . In 1997 , the state filed suit to establish its jurisdiction , leading New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani to remark dramatically that his father , an Italian who immigrated through Ellis Island , never intended to go to New Jersey . The border was redrawn using information based on studies using geographic information science .
