According to the late well - known Meranaw scholar Dr. Mamitua Saber , Marawi got its charter in 1940 . The granting of a charter to the old Dansalan municipality was jointly conceived by the Philippine Commonwealth President Manuel L. Quezon and Assemblyman , later Senator , Tomas L. Cabili . The changing of the official name from Dansalan to Marawi was through Congressional amendment of the Charter in 1956 sponsored by Sen. Domocao Alonto ( nl ) . This is embodied by Republic Act No. 1552 dated June 16 , 1956 .
