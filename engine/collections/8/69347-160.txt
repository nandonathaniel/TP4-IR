The war began under the pretext that Maria Theresa was ineligible to succeed to the Habsburg thrones of her father , Charles VI , because Salic law precluded royal inheritance by a woman . In practice , this was an excuse put forward by the Kingdoms of France and Prussia , joined by the Electorate of Bavaria , to challenge Habsburg power . Maria Theresa was supported by the Kingdom of Great Britain and the Dutch Republic , the traditional enemies of France , as well as the Kingdom of Sardinia and the Electorate of Saxony .
