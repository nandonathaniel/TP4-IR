The Brooklyn Bridge is a hybrid cable - stayed / suspension bridge in New York City and is one of the oldest bridges in the United States . Started in 1869 and completed fourteen ( 14 ) years later in 1883 , it connects the boroughs of Manhattan and Brooklyn by spanning the East River . It has a main span of 1,595.5 feet ( 486.3 m ) and was the first steel - wire suspension bridge constructed . It was originally called the New York and Brooklyn Bridge and the East River Bridge , but it was later dubbed the Brooklyn Bridge , a name coming from an earlier January 25 , 1867 , letter to the editor of the Brooklyn Daily Eagle and formally so named by the city government in 1915 . Since opening , it has become an icon of New York City and was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1964 and a National Historic Civil Engineering Landmark in 1972 .
