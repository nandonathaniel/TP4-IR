Although action potentials are generated locally on patches of excitable membrane , the resulting currents can trigger action potentials on neighboring stretches of membrane , precipitating a domino - like propagation . In contrast to passive spread of electric potentials ( electrotonic potential ) , action potentials are generated anew along excitable stretches of membrane and propagate without decay . Myelinated sections of axons are not excitable and do not produce action potentials and the signal is propagated passively as electrotonic potential . Regularly spaced unmyelinated patches , called the nodes of Ranvier , generate action potentials to boost the signal . Known as saltatory conduction , this type of signal propagation provides a favorable tradeoff of signal velocity and axon diameter . Depolarization of axon terminals , in general , triggers the release of neurotransmitter into the synaptic cleft . In addition , backpropagating action potentials have been recorded in the dendrites of pyramidal neurons , which are ubiquitous in the neocortex . These are thought to have a role in spike - timing - dependent plasticity .
