For example , when President William McKinley advocated annexation of the Republic of Hawaii in 1898 , he said that `` We need Hawaii as much and a good deal more than we did California . It is manifest destiny . '' On the other hand , former President Grover Cleveland , a Democrat who had blocked the annexation of Hawaii during his administration , wrote that McKinley 's annexation of the territory was a `` perversion of our national destiny '' . Historians continued that debate ; some have interpreted American acquisition of other Pacific island groups in the 1890s as an extension of manifest destiny across the Pacific Ocean . Others have regarded it as the antithesis of manifest destiny and merely imperialism .
