For example , some programming languages use a common stack to store both data local to a called procedure and the linking information that allows the procedure to return to its caller . This means that the program moves data into and out of the same stack that contains critical return addresses for the procedure calls . If data is moved to the wrong location on the stack , or an oversized data item is moved to a stack location that is not large enough to contain it , return information for procedure calls may be corrupted , causing the program to fail .
