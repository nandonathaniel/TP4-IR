Note : If N is a null leaf and we do not want to represent null leaves as actual node objects , we can modify the algorithm by first calling delete_case1 ( ) on its parent ( the node that we delete , n in the code above ) and deleting it afterwards . We do this if the parent is black ( red is trivial ) , so it behaves in the same way as a null leaf ( and is sometimes called a ' phantom ' leaf ) . And we can safely delete it at the end as n will remain a leaf after all operations , as shown above . In addition , the sibling tests in cases 2 and 3 require updating as it is no longer true that the sibling will have children represented as objects .
