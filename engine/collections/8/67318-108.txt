Victim 's conscious actions R v. Blaue is a criminal law application of the `` thin skull rule '' in criminal law . The defendant visited the home of a Jehovah 's Witness and demanded sex . When she refused , he stabbed her four times . At hospital , she refused a blood transfusion which would have saved her life . There was no suggestion that the doctors had acted improperly . Blaue was convicted of manslaughter by an unlawful act , namely wounding with intent . `` But for '' his actions , she would not have been faced with the choice about treatment and those who use violence on others must take their victims as they find them ( albeit that he had known her religion and so her refusal was foreseeable ) .
