Christian groups and congregations first organized themselves loosely . In Paul 's time , although certain decisions by Elders and Apostles were binding , as in the Council of Jerusalem , there were no precisely delineated functions yet for bishops , elders , and deacons . A Church hierarchy , however , seems to have developed by the late 1st century and early 2nd century ( see Pastoral Epistles , c 90 -- 140 ) . These structures were certainly formalized well before the end of the Early Christian period , which concluded with the legalization of Christianity by Constantine 's Edict of Milan in 313 and the holding of the First Council of Nicea in 325 , when the title of Metropolitan bishop first appears .
