Extremophile archaea , particularly those resistant either to heat or to extremes of acidity and alkalinity , are a source of enzymes that function under these harsh conditions . These enzymes have found many uses . For example , thermostable DNA polymerases , such as the Pfu DNA polymerase from Pyrococcus furiosus , revolutionized molecular biology by allowing the polymerase chain reaction to be used in research as a simple and rapid technique for cloning DNA . In industry , amylases , galactosidases and pullulanases in other species of Pyrococcus that function at over 100 ° C ( 212 ° F ) allow food processing at high temperatures , such as the production of low lactose milk and whey . Enzymes from these thermophilic archaea also tend to be very stable in organic solvents , allowing their use in environmentally friendly processes in green chemistry that synthesize organic compounds . This stability makes them easier to use in structural biology . Consequently , the counterparts of bacterial or eukaryotic enzymes from extremophile archaea are often used in structural studies .
