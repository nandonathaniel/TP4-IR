The Four Seasons is the best known of Vivaldi 's works . Unusual for the time , Vivaldi published the concerti with accompanying poems ( possibly written by Vivaldi himself ) that elucidated what it was about those seasons that his music was intended to evoke . It provides one of the earliest and most - detailed examples of what was later called program music -- music with a narrative element .
