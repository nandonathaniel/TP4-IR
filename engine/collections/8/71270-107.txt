Interpersonal everyday problem solving is dependent upon the individual personal motivational and contextual components . One such component is the emotional valence of `` real - world '' problems and it can either impede or aid problem - solving performance . Researchers have focused on the role of emotions in problem solving ( D'Zurilla & Goldfried , 1971 ; D'Zurilla & Nezu , 1982 ) , demonstrating that poor emotional control can disrupt focus on the target task and impede problem resolution and likely lead to negative outcomes such as fatigue , depression , and inertia ( Rath , Langenbahn , Simon , Sherr , & Diller , 2004 ) . In conceptualization , human problem solving consists of two related processes : problem orientation , the motivational / attitudinal / affective approach to problematic situations and problem - solving skills . Studies conclude people 's strategies cohere with their goals ( Hoppmann & Blanchard - Fields , 2010 , Berg et al. , 1998 ) and they are stemmed from the natural process of comparing oneself with others ( Sonstegard and Bitter , 1998 ) .
