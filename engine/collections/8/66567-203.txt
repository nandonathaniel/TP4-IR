Public opinion in South Africa split along racial and ethnic lines . The British elements strongly supported the war , and formed by far the largest military component . Likewise the Indian element ( led by Mahatma Gandhi ) generally supported the war effort . Afrikaners were split , with some like Botha and Smuts taking a prominent leadership role in the British war effort . This position was rejected by many rural Afrikaners who supported the Maritz Rebellion . The trade union movement was divided . Many urban blacks supported the war expecting it would raise their status in society . Others said it was not relevant to the struggle for their rights . The Coloured element was generally supportive and many served in a Coloured Corps in East Africa and France , also hoping to better themselves after the war .
