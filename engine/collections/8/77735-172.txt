It was fortunate for de Gaulle that the Germans had forcibly removed members of the Vichy government and taken them to Germany a few days earlier on 20 August ; it allowed him to enter Paris as a liberator in the midst of the general euphoria , but there were serious concerns that communist elements of the resistance , which had done so much to clear the way for the military , would try to seize the opportunity to proclaim their own ' Peoples ' Government ' in the capital . De Gaulle made contact with Leclerc and demanded the presence of the 2nd Armoured Division to accompany him on a massed parade down the Champs Elysees , `` as much for prestige as for security '' . This was in spite of the fact that Leclerc 's unit was fighting as part of the American 1st Army and were under strict orders to continue their next objective without obeying orders from anyone else . In the event , the American General Omar Bradley decided that Leclerc 's division would be indispensable for the maintenance of order and the liquidation of the last pockets of resistance in the French capital . Earlier , on 21 August , de Gaulle had appointed his military advisor General Marie - Pierre Koenig as Governor of Paris .
