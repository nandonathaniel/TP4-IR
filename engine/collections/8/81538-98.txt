In the attempt to satisfy Austria at the time , Britain gave their electoral vote in Hanover for the candidacy of Maria Theresa 's son , Joseph II , as the Holy Roman Emperor , much to the dismay of Frederick and Prussia . Not only that , Britain would soon join the Austro - Russian alliance , but complications arose . Britain 's basic framework for the alliance itself was to protect Hanover 's interests against France . At the same time , Kaunitz kept approaching the French in the hope of establishing just such an alliance with Austria . Not only that , France had no intention to ally with Russia , who , years earlier , had meddled in France 's affairs during Austria 's succession war . France also saw the dismemberment of Prussia as threatening to the stability of Central Europe .
