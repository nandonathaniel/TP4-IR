Adders are not usually aggressive , tending to be rather timid and biting only when cornered or alarmed . People are generally bitten only after stepping on them or attempting to pick them up . They will usually disappear into the undergrowth at a hint of any danger , but will return once all is quiet , often to the same spot . Occasionally , individual snakes will reveal their presence with a loud and sustained hissing , hoping to warn off potential aggressors . Often , these turn out to be pregnant females . When the adder is threatened , the front part of the body is drawn into an S - shape to prepare for a strike .
