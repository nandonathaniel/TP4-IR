On February 23 , 2018 , according to a published report by ESPN , an FBI wiretap revealed that head coach Sean Miller talked with Christian Dawkins ( another key figure in the scandal ) to discuss paying their top prospect , Deandre Ayton , $100,000 to commit to Arizona , with the monetary situation being dealt with directly with him . While Miller would not coach their next game that day against Oregon , Arizona allowed Ayton to play . Coach Sean Miller subsequently denied the allegation and the University of Arizona announced he will remain the coach of Arizona Wildcats men 's basketball team , with Ayton also allowed to continue playing with the team for the rest of the season . However , as a consequence of the report involving Ayton , both of Arizona 's remaining committed recruits from the class of 2018 , Shareef O'Neal and Brandon Williams , announced they had decommitted .
