On August 22 , 2013 , Yahoo News reported that Marc Maiffret , a chief technology officer of the cybersecurity firm BeyondTrust , is prompting hackers to help raise a $10,000 reward for Khalil Shreateh . On August 20 , Maiffret stated that he had already raised $9,000 in his efforts , including the $2,000 he himself contributed . He and other hackers alike have denounced Facebook for refusing Shreateh compensation . Maiffret said : `` He is sitting there in Palestine doing this research on a five - year - old laptop that looks like it is half broken . It 's something that might help him out in a big way . '' Facebook representatives have since responded , `` We will not change our practice of refusing to pay rewards to researchers who have tested vulnerabilities against real users . '' Facebook representatives also claimed they 'd paid out over $1 million to individuals who have discovered bugs in the past .
