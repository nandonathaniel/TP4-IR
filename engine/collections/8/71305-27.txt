In addition the length of each day , which is determined by the season , has a significant impact on the climate . The 24 - hour days found near the poles in summer result in a large daily - average solar flux reaching the top of the atmosphere in these regions . On the June solstice 36 % more solar radiation reaches the top of the atmosphere over the course of the day at the North Pole than at the Equator ( Serreze and Barry , 2005 ) . However , in the six months from the September equinox to March equinox the North Pole receives no sunlight . Images from the NOAA 's North Pole Web Cam illustrate Arctic daylight , darkness and the changing of the seasons .
