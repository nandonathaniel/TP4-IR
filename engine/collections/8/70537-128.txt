The preamble to the constitution explicitly stated that it is the nation 's will to protect `` all Spaniards and the peoples of Spain in the exercise of human rights , their cultures and traditions , languages and institutions '' . This is a significant recognition not only in that it differed drastically from the restrictive linguistic policies during the Franco era , but also because part of the distinctiveness of the `` historical nationalities '' lies on their own regional languages . The nation is thus openly multilingual , in which Castilian -- that is , Spanish -- is the official language in all territories , but the `` other Spanish languages '' can also be official in their respective communities , in accordance with their Statutes of Autonomy .
