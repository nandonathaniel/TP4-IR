Many residential PV systems are connected to the grid wherever available , especially in developed countries with large markets . In these grid - connected PV systems , use of energy storage is optional . In certain applications such as satellites , lighthouses , or in developing countries , batteries or additional power generators are often added as back - ups . Such stand - alone power systems permit operations at night and at other times of limited sunlight .
