After leaving Southampton on 10 April 1912 , Titanic called at Cherbourg in France and Queenstown ( now Cobh ) in Ireland before heading west to New York . On 14 April , four days into the crossing and about 375 miles ( 600 km ) south of Newfoundland , she hit an iceberg at 11 : 40 p.m. ship 's time . The collision caused the hull plates to buckle inwards along her starboard ( right ) side and opened five of her sixteen watertight compartments to the sea ; she could only survive four flooding . Meanwhile , passengers and some crew members were evacuated in lifeboats , many of which were launched only partially loaded . A disproportionate number of men were left aboard because of a `` women and children first '' protocol for loading lifeboats . At 2 : 20 a.m. , she broke apart and foundered with well over one thousand people still aboard . Just under two hours after Titanic sank , the Cunard liner RMS Carpathia arrived and brought aboard an estimated 705 survivors .
