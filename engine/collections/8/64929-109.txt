About a kilometer from the camp , the Army advisers and the 8th Airborne came upon the bodies of the lost Special Forces patrol , all dead , including the camp commander . As the 8th Airborne moved up the mountain , the lead elements were taking small arms fire . Before long , it was obvious that the PAVN troops had filtered down on all sides . By noon of 4 August , the 8th Airborne with its advisers were in a fight that lasted several days . When the unit finally overwhelmed the PAVN forces because of superior firepower in air and artillery , it reached the top of the mountain and found a fully operational PAVN Headquarters , complete with hospital facilities and anti-aircraft emplacements . During the three - day battle , the 8th Airborne Battalion alone withstood six separate ground attacks and casualties among all the South Vietnamese units were heavy .
