On May 28 , 2015 , the Bulls fired Tom Thibodeau to seek a `` change in approach '' . The Bulls named Fred Hoiberg as their head coach on June 2 , 2015 . The Bulls had only 1 draft pick in the 2015 NBA draft , and selected center Bobby Portis from the University of Arkansas . Bulls forward Mike Dunleavy Jr. was ruled out for at least the first four months of the season after completing back surgery . With Dunleavy out indefinitely , the Bulls promoted Doug McDermott to the starting lineup in his place at small forward . Before the season started , coach Fred Hoiberg made an incredibly controversial move by putting Nikola MirotiÄ‡ as his starting power forward to pair with center Pau Gasol , meaning Joakim Noah , a long - time Bulls veteran and a fan - favorite was to come off the bench . Hoiberg told the media that the move was suggested by Noah himself but Noah denied having made any suggestions to Hoiberg , which sparked a distrust between the two before the season even began .
