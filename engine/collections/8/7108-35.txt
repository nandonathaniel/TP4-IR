The Post Office Department was enlarged during the tenure of President Andrew Jackson . As the Post Office expanded , difficulties were experienced due to a lack of employees and transportation . The Post Office 's employees at that time were still subject to the so - called `` spoils '' system , where faithful political supporters of the executive branch were appointed to positions in the post office and other government corporations as a reward for their patronage . These appointees rarely had prior experience in postal service and mail delivery . This system of political patronage was replaced in 1883 , after passage of the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act .
