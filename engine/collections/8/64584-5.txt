The MAVNI program has several notable recruiting successes ; for example , the program enlisted Saral Shrestha , the U.S. Army Soldier of the Year for 2012 , and Augustus Maiyo , the winner of the 2012 Marine Corps Marathon . It also enlisted world class athletes like Paul Chelimo , the 2016 Olympic silver medalist at 5000 meters and many others . MAVNI recruits of the Army have a lower attrition rate than other recruits , and many hold higher educational credentials than other enlistees . Around 30 % of MAVNI recruits were assigned to Special Operations units due to their language abilities , which facilitate operations in foreign speaking lands . Several MAVNI recruits have written about their experiences in the program .
