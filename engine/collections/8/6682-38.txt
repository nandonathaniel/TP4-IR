Maass argued in 2015 that the expansionist theme is a myth that goes against the `` relative consensus among experts that the primary U.S. objective was the repeal of British maritime restrictions . He argues that consensus among scholars is that The United States went to war `` because six years of economic sanctions had failed to bring Britain to the negotiating table , and threatening the Royal Navy 's Canadian supply base was their last hope . '' However , he also notes that many historians continue to publish in support of expansionism as a cause , and that even those opposed to the idea continue to include caveats regarding `` possible expansionism underlying US motives '' . Maass agrees that theoretically expansionism might have tempted Americans , but finds that `` leaders feared the domestic political consequences of doing so . Notably , what limited expansionism there was focused on sparsely populated western lands rather than the more populous eastern settlements ( of Canada ) . ''
