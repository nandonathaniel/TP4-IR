There are no other significant documents from this period of pre-Hispanic Philippine society and culture until the Doctrina Christiana of the late 16th century , written at the start of the Spanish period in both native Baybayin script and Spanish . Other artifacts with Kawi script and baybayin were found , such as an Ivory seal from Butuan dated to the early 11th century and the Calatagan pot with baybayin inscription , dated to the 13th century .
