In March 2009 , the print and web editions of The Onion 's The A.V. Club called Cowboy Bebop `` rightly a huge hit '' , and listed it as a gateway series to understanding the medium of anime as a whole . Suskind said : `` It was unlike anything the genre had seen before . It even approached its music differently . The show kicked off with a wormhole of a theme song , and the soundtrack moves so seamlessly through genres , from rock to country to pop to jazz to funk , it 's shocking to learn that one set of musicians is behind it all '' . In an interview , producer Sean Akins also states that the series `` created a whole new world '' . `` It 's hard for me to quantify the impact that I think it has had . It changed anime . I think people began to think about what shows would be cool . I think it redefined cool within animation , not only in Japan but in the States '' .
