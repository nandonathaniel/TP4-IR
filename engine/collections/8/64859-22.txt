Situations exemplifying the `` tragedy of the commons '' include the overfishing and destruction of the Grand Banks , the destruction of salmon runs on rivers that have been dammed -- most prominently in modern times on the Columbia River in the Northwest United States , and historically in North Atlantic rivers -- the devastation of the sturgeon fishery -- in modern Russia , but historically in the United States as well -- and , in terms of water supply , the limited water available in arid regions ( e.g. , the area of the Aral Sea ) and the Los Angeles water system supply , especially at Mono Lake and Owens Lake .
