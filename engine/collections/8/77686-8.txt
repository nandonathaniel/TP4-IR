The system of firing an odd number of rounds is said to have been originated by Samuel Pepys , Secretary to the Navy in the Restoration , as a way of economizing on the use of powder , the rule until that time having been that all guns had to be fired . Odd numbers were chosen , as even numbers indicated a death . With the increase in quality of naval gunpowder by the use of potassium nitrate , honours rendered at sea were increased to the shore salute. 21 guns became the highest national honor .
