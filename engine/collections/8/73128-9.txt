United States Navy decommissioning : One possible origin is from the U.S. Navy 's Allowance Type ( AT ) coding system used for logistics . The allowance type code is a single digit that identifies the reason that materiel is being carried in stock . Throughout the life - cycle of a warship , many pieces of equipment are upgraded or replaced , requiring onboard spare parts to be disposed of , and the code is AT - 6 for parts designated for disposal . Following World War II , there were a great number of warships being decommissioned , sold , scrapped , or deactivated and placed in reserve ( commonly referred to as `` mothballed '' ) . During this process , labor workers would bring up spare parts from the storerooms and the supply clerk would tell them the AT code . Anything to be disposed of was referred to as AT - 6 -- which sounds like `` 86 '' .
