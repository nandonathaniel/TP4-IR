Supreme Court Justice Peter Vivian Daniel disagreed with this position and considered natural born citizen as every person born of citizen parents within the United States . In 1857 , in a concurring opinion in Dred Scott v. Sandford , he quoted an English - language translation of Emerich de Vattel 's 1758 treatise The Law of Nations ( Le Droit des gens ) , stating that `` The natives , or natural - born citizens , are those born in the country of parents who are citizens '' .
