The enlisted men of the 54th were recruited on the promise of pay and allowances equal to their white counterparts . This was supposed to amount to subsistence and $13 a month . Instead , they were informed upon arriving in South Carolina , the Department of the South would pay them only $7 per month ( $10 with $3 withheld for clothing , while white soldiers did not pay for clothing at all . ) Colonel Shaw and many others immediately began protesting the measure . Although the state of Massachusetts offered to make up the difference in pay , on principle , a regiment - wide boycott of the pay tables on paydays became the norm .
