After Genghis Khan 's death , the empire was subdivided into four kingdoms or Khanates . These eventually became quasi-independent after the Toluid Civil War ( 1260 -- 1264 ) , which broke out in a battle for power following Möngke Khan 's death in 1259 . One of the khanates , the `` Great Khaanate '' , consisting of the Mongol homeland and China , became known as the Yuan dynasty under Kublai Khan , the grandson of Genghis Khan . He set up his capital in present - day Beijing . After more than a century of power , the Yuan was replaced by the Ming dynasty in 1368 , and the Mongol court fled to the north . As the Ming armies pursued the Mongols into their homeland , they successfully sacked and destroyed the Mongol capital Karakorum among a few other cities . Some of these attacks were repelled by the Mongols under Ayushridar and his general Köke Temür .
