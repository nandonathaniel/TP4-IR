In digital QAM , each component wave is composed of samples of constant amplitude , each occupying a uniform time slot , and the amplitude is quantized , restricted to one of a finite number of levels , representing one or more binary digits ( bits ) of a digital bit stream . In analog QAM , the amplitude of each component sine wave is varied continuously in time by an analog signal .
