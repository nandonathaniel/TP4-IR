Mississippian peoples in the Midwest were mostly farmers who followed the rich , flat floodplains of Midwestern rivers . They brought with them a well - developed agricultural complex based on three major crops -- maize , beans , and squash . Maize , or corn , was the primary crop of Mississippian farmers . They gathered a wide variety of seeds , nuts , and berries , and fished and hunted for fowl to supplement their diets . With such an intensive form of agriculture , this culture supported large populations .
