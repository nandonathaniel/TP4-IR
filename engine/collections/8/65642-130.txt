Frankfurt School psychoanalyst and humanistic philosopher Erich Fromm drew a similar distinction between negative and positive freedom in his 1941 work , The Fear of Freedom , that predates Berlin 's essay by more than a decade . Fromm sees the distinction between the two types of freedom emerging alongside humanity 's evolution away from the instinctual activity that characterizes lower animal forms . This aspect of freedom , he argues , `` is here used not in its positive sense of ' freedom to ' but in its negative sense of ' freedom from ' , namely freedom from instinctual determination of his actions . '' For Fromm , then , negative freedom marks the beginning of humanity as a species conscious of its own existence free from base instinct .
