If the standard deviation is unknown then Student 's t distribution is used as the critical value . This value is dependent on the confidence level ( C ) for the test and degrees of freedom . The degrees of freedom is found by subtracting one from the number of observations , n − 1 . The critical value is found from the t - distribution table . In this table the critical value is written as t ( r ) , where r is the degrees of freedom and α = 1 − C 2 ( \ displaystyle \ alpha = ( 1 - C \ over 2 ) ) .
