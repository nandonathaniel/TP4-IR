The Province of New Jersey was originally settled in the 1610s as part of the colony of New Netherland . The surrender of Fort Amsterdam in September 1664 gave control over the entire Mid-Atlantic region to the English as part the Second Anglo - Dutch War . The English justified the seizure by claiming that John Cabot ( c. 1450 -- c. 1508 ) , an Italian under the sponsorship of the English King Henry VII , had been the first to discover the place , though it was probably to assert control over the profitable North Atlantic trade . Director - General of New Netherland , Peter Stuyvesant , ( unable to rouse a military defense ) relinquished control of the colony and was able in the articles of transfer to secure guarantees for property rights , laws of inheritance , and freedom of religion . After the surrender Richard Nicolls took the position as deputy - governor of New Amsterdam and the rest of New Netherland , including those settlements on the west side of the North River ( Hudson River ) known as Bergen , and those along the Delaware River that had been New Sweden .
