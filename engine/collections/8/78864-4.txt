More narrowly , the leading tone is the seventh scale degree of the major scale , with a strong affinity for and leading melodically to the tonic ( Benward and Saker 2003 , 203 ) . It is sung as ti in movable - do solfège . For example , in the C major scale ( white keys on a piano , starting on C ) , the leading note is the note B ; and the leading note chord uses the notes B , D , and F : a diminished triad . In music theory , the leading note triad is symbolized by the Roman numeral vii ° , while the leading - tone seventh chord may be vii 7 or vii 7 .
