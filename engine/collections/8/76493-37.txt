In 1993 , Enron established a joint venture in energy investments with CalPERS , the California state pension fund , called the Joint Energy Development Investments ( JEDI ) . In 1997 , Skilling , serving as Chief Operating Officer ( COO ) , asked CalPERS to join Enron in a separate investment . CalPERS was interested in the idea , but only if it could be terminated as a partner in JEDI . However , Enron did not want to show any debt from assuming CalPERS ' stake in JEDI on its balance sheet . Chief Financial Officer ( CFO ) Fastow developed the special purpose entity Chewco Investments limited partnership ( L.P. ) which raised debt guaranteed by Enron and was used to acquire CalPERS 's joint venture stake for $383 million . Because of Fastow 's organization of Chewco , JEDI 's losses were kept off of Enron 's balance sheet .
