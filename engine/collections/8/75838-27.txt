The company was founded by Nick Woodman in 2002 . He was motivated by a tramp in 2002 surfing trip to Australia in which he was hoping to capture quality action photos , but could not because amateur photographers could not get close enough or buy quality equipment at reasonable prices . His desire for a camera system that could capture the professional angles inspired the ' GoPro ' name .
