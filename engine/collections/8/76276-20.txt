The stated aim of the `` resocialisation '' programme was to improve the integration of Aboriginal people into modern ( European - Australian ) society , however a recent study conducted in Melbourne reported that there was no tangible improvement in the social position of `` removed '' Aboriginal people as compared to `` non-removed '' . Particularly in the areas of employment and post-secondary education , the removed children had about the same results as those who were not removed . In the early decades of the program , post-secondary education was limited for most Australians , but the removed children lagged behind their white contemporaries as educational opportunities improved .
