It has become a tradition to give out gift bags to the presenters and performers at the Oscars . In recent years , these gifts have also been extended to award nominees and winners . The value of each of these gift bags can reach into the tens of thousands of dollars . In 2014 , the value was reported to be as high as US $80,000 . The value has risen to the point where the U.S. Internal Revenue Service issued a statement regarding the gifts and their taxable status . Oscar gift bags have included vacation packages to Hawaii and Mexico and Japan , a private dinner party for the recipient and friends at a restaurant , videophones , a four - night stay at a hotel , watches , bracelets , vacation packages , spa treatments , bottles of vodka , maple salad dressing , and weight - loss gummie candy . Some of the gifts have even had a `` risque '' element to them ; in 2014 , the adult products retailer Adam & Eve had a `` Secret Room Gifting Suite '' . Celebrities visiting the gifting suite included Judith Hoag , Carolyn Hennesy , Kate Linder , Chris Mulkey , Jim O'Heir , and NBA player John Salley .
