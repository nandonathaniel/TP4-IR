A dramatic increase in the city 's urban sprawl began in the 19th century , when labourers flocked from the countryside to work in the new factories that were then springing up . Large developments of small terraced houses began to appear and the new public transportation systems - ( the metro , buses and trams ) - allowed workers to commute into the city daily . Suburban districts also sprung up around the city centre to accommodate those who wanted to escape the squalid conditions of the industrial town .
