The Métis settlements in Alberta are the only recognized land base of Métis in Canada and are represented and governed collectively by a unique Métis government known as the Métis Settlements General Council ( MSGC ) , also known as the `` All - Council '' . The MSGC is the provincial , national , and international representative of the Federated Metis Settlements and holds fee simple land title via Letters Patents of 1.25 million acres of land , making the MSGC the largest land holder in the province other than the Crown in the Right of Alberta . The MSGC is the only recognized Metis Governerment in Canada with prescribed land , power , and jurisdiction via the Metis Settlements Act ( legislation arsing from legal action taken up by the Metis Settlemetns against the Crown in the 1970 's ) . The Métis Settlements consist of predominantly Indigenous Métis populations native to Northern Alberta -- unique from those of the Red River , the Great Lakes , and other migrant Métis from further east . However , following the Riel and Dumont Resistances some Red - River Métis fled westward , marrying into the contemporary Métis Settlement populations during the end of the 19th century and into the early 20th century . Historically referred to as the `` Nomadic Half - breeds '' , the Métis of Northern Alberta have a unique history and their fight for land is still evident today with the eight contemporary Métis settlements .
