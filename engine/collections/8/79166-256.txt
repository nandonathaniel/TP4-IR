At the start of 1975 , the South Vietnamese had three times as much artillery and twice the number of tanks and armored cars as the opposition . They also had 1,400 aircraft and a two - to - one numerical superiority in combat troops over their Communist enemies . However , the rising oil prices meant that much of this could not be used . They faced a well - organized , highly determined and well - funded North Vietnam . Much of the North 's material and financial support came from the communist bloc . Within South Vietnam , there was increasing chaos . The departure of the American military had compromised an economy dependent on U.S. financial support and the presence of a large number of U.S. troops . South Vietnam suffered from the global recession that followed the Arab oil embargo .
