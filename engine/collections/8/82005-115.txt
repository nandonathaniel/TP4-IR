Erin Strauss ( portrayed by Jayne Atkinson ; seasons 2 -- 3 , 5 -- 9 ; 23 episodes ) , an assistant director and the BAU Unit Chief 's direct superior . While her FBI experience was primarily in administration , SSA Derek Morgan remarked on her masterly marksmanship , after observing her at a firing range . In early episodes , Strauss appeared only concerned with herself and appearances within the Bureau , going so far as to force SSA Jennifer Jareau to accept a promotion to the Pentagon in the episode `` JJ '' ( season 6 ) . Further character development revealed her alcohol abuse . After being confronted by Morgan and Hotchner , Strauss accepts help and achieves sobriety . In the season 8 finale , the Replicator breaks into Strauss 's hotel room in New York , drugs her , and forces her -- at gunpoint -- to drink alcohol from her room 's minibar . Hotchner finds her on a bench near the hotel , where Strauss dies in his arms . Her death is avenged when Rossi traps the Replicator in an exploding house . Fittingly , Strauss 's sobriety helps defeat the Replicator as Rossi uses her sobriety chip to escape the Replicator 's trap and taunts him with it . After attending her funeral , the members of the BAU gather in a still - emotional Rossi 's backyard , reminisce , and toast her memory . Showrunner Erica Messer chose to kill Strauss off because she felt that the character had come full circle since she was first introduced .
