During the 2016 WWE draft , The New Day were drafted to the Raw brand , making the WWE Tag Team Championship exclusive to the brand . In parallel to a lengthy feud with Gallows and Anderson for the title , The New Day became the longest reigning WWE Tag Team Champions in the title 's history , breaking the old record of 331 days previously set by Paul London and Brian Kendrick and , after the creation of the SmackDown Tag Team Championship for the SmackDown brand , became the last people to have held their championship as the sole tag team title in WWE and the first to hold it under its new name of Raw Tag Team Championship . The New Day would continue to successfully retain their championship against Gallows and Anderson in the following months , such as SummerSlam on August 21 , Clash of Champions on September 25 and the following night on Raw , ending their feud in the process .
