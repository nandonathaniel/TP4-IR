In the living room , Kristen notices the smoke alarm she left on the floor is now sitting on a chair , and realizes someone else has been in the house . Upon going to retrieve her cell phone from the wall charger , she finds it is missing , and begins to panic . When she hears a noise from the backyard , she arms herself with a knife , and opens the curtains to find the man in the mask , staring at her . She stumbles into the hallway , and watches as the front door unlatches . When she goes to push the door closed , she sees the blonde woman outside , now in a dollface mask . After locking the door , Kristen hides in the bedroom and hears the strangers outside banging violently against the walls of the house .
