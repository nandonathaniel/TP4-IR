While Lesley Goldberg of The Hollywood Reporter was pleased Blaine 's season three transfer to McKinley in the first episode increased Criss ' screen time with Colfer and the New Directions cast , she stated that the move `` screams of co-dependency . '' In contrast , Entertainment Weekly 's Abby West found it romantic , and noted : `` Blaine and Kurt , with their budding love and witty , pseudo-urbane ways , are my favorite couple to watch ... I look forward to hearing ( Blaine ) sing more , watching him bump up against the insular Glee clubbers , and seeing him show off his non-uniform attire . Several reviewers were unhappy with the second episode 's revelation that Blaine was a junior , not a senior like Kurt , as had been implied in the previous season . VanDerWerff wrote that Blaine `` seems to have simultaneously gotten younger and had a complete personality transplant over the summer '' , Billboard 's Rae Votta noted `` the continuity - bending plot point that he 's somehow a Junior and not a Senior like his boyfriend '' , and Samantha Urban of The Dallas Morning News allowed her exasperation to show : `` Oh really , Glee ? Blaine 's a junior ? Blaine 's younger than Kurt ? Fine . FINE . ''
