In addition to guiding cell fate determination , cues exist in the retina to determine the dorsal - ventral ( D-V ) and nasal - temporal ( N-T ) axes . The D-V axis is established by a ventral to dorsal gradient of VAX2 , whereas the N-T axis is coordinated by expression of the forkhead transcription factors FOXD1 and FOXG1 . Additional gradients are formed within the retina that aid in proper targeting of RGC axons that function to establish the retinotopic map .
