Near the end of filming , Thurman was injured in a crash while filming the scene in which she drives to Bill . According to Thurman , she was uncomfortable driving the car and asked a stuntperson to do it ; Tarantino pressured her into driving it herself , assuring her that the car and road were safe . She lost control of the car and hit a tree , suffering a concussion and damage to her knees . Thurman requested the crash footage , but Miramax would only release it , in Thurman 's words , if she signed a document `` releasing them of any consequences of ( Thurman 's ) future pain and suffering '' . Tarantino was apologetic , but he and Thurman were acrimonious for years afterwards ; she said after the accident she `` went from being a creative contributor and performer to being like a broken tool '' . Miramax released the footage in 2018 after Thurman went to police following the accusations of sexual abuse by Weinstein from multiple women .
