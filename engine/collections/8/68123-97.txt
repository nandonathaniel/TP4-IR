Britain stayed aloof from alliances in the late 19th century , with an independence made possible by its island location , its dominant navy , its dominant position in finance and trade , and its strong industrial base . It rejected tariffs and practiced free trade . After losing power in Britain in 1874 , Liberal leader Gladstone returned to center stage in 1876 by calling for a moralistic foreign policy , as opposed to the realism of his great adversary Benjamin Disraeli . The issue drew the party line between Gladstone 's Liberals ( who denounced the immoral Ottomans ) and Disraeli 's Conservatives ( who downplayed the atrocities and supported the Ottoman Empire as an offset to Russian power ) . Disraeli had threatened war with Russia on the issue and Gladstone argued he was wrong . Liberal opinion was convulsed by atrocities in the Balkans , in particular the massacre of more than 10,000 Christian Bulgars by Turkish irregulars . Gladstone denounced the Turks as `` abominable and bestial lusts ... at which Hell itself might almost blush '' and demanded they withdraw from European soil . The pamphlet sold an astonishing 200,000 copies .
