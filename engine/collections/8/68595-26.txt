I Ching divination , which dates from early China , has played a major role in Chinese culture and philosophy for more than two thousand years . The I Ching tradition descended in part from the Oracle bone divination system that was used by rulers in the Shang dynasty , and grew over time into a rich literary wisdom tradition that was closely tied to the philosophy of Yin and Yang . I Ching practice is widespread throughout East Asia , and commonly involves the use of coins or ( traditionally ) sticks of Yarrow .
