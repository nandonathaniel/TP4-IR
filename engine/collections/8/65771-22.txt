As the RAM types used for primary storage are volatile ( uninitialized at start up ) , a computer containing only such storage would not have a source to read instructions from , in order to start the computer . Hence , non-volatile primary storage containing a small startup program ( BIOS ) is used to bootstrap the computer , that is , to read a larger program from non-volatile secondary storage to RAM and start to execute it . A non-volatile technology used for this purpose is called ROM , for read - only memory ( the terminology may be somewhat confusing as most ROM types are also capable of random access ) .
