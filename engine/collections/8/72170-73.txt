The oldest Protestant churches , such as the Unitas Fratrum and Moravian Church , date their origins to Jan Hus ( John Huss ) in the early 15th century . As it was led by a Bohemian noble majority , and recognised , for a time , by the Basel Compacts , the Hussite Reformation was Europe 's first `` Magisterial Reformation '' because the ruling magistrates supported it , unlike the `` Radical Reformation '' , which the state did not support .
