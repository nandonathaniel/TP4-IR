Following the conquest , the Anglo - Saxon nobility were either exiled or joined the ranks of the peasantry . It has been estimated that only about 8 per cent of the land was under Anglo - Saxon control by 1087 . Many Anglo - Saxon nobles fled to Scotland , Ireland , and Scandinavia . The Byzantine Empire became a popular destination for many Anglo - Saxon soldiers , as the Byzantines were in need of mercenaries . The Anglo - Saxons became the predominant element in the elite Varangian Guard , hitherto a largely North Germanic unit , from which the emperor 's bodyguard was drawn and continued to serve the empire until the early 15th century . However , the population of England at home remained largely Anglo - Saxon ; for them , little changed immediately except that their Anglo - Saxon lord was replaced by a Norman lord .
