Despite this , it was praised by one reviewer at GameZebo for its intense environment and creepy sounds and graphics , as well as its jumpscares . It was also given a mixed review by PC Gamer , who called it `` another rivet in the series ' steel - clad design which immortalized its Let 's Play legacy in a few short months '' and `` certainly the scariest of the four ( games ) '' , but also criticized the gameplay , saying that `` the humdrum repetition of the same sequence over and over ... is too much of a chore to fully pull me in '' , as well as criticizing the game 's lack of the series 's signature camera system .
