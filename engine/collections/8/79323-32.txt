The use of the wand causes Tikka to become ill with black streaks appearing all over her body . She says that the only way to save her is to place her in a magic pool back at the Shield safe house . They return to the safehouse , but are ambushed by Leilah and the remaining Inferni . The trio successfully kill the Inferni , but Leilah is resurrected by a magic spell . Just as Ward places Tikka in the magic pool , Leilah hangs Jakoby and knocks both Ward and Tikka out of the pool . Leilah unsuccessfully tries to convince Tikka to join her ( revealing they are sisters ) . Jakoby breaks free and shoots the wand out of Leilah 's hand , but runs out of ammo before he can kill her again . Leilah is about to kill Tikka when Ward picks up the fallen wand and is revealed to also be a Bright , using the wand to kill Leilah with an explosion that sets the building on fire . In the ensuing commotion , Tikka disappears and the injured Ward and Jakoby flee from the building , but Ward falls behind and is trapped by an explosion , causing Jakoby to have to return and save him . After rescuing Ward , Dorghu and his clan appear and perform an ancient orc ceremony signifying to Jakoby that he is now `` blooded '' - an Orcish status only achievable by an act of great bravery .
