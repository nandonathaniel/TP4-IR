Advanced capitalism has its principle of organization in the process of economic concentration . This social formation exists when the capitalist model becomes deeply integrated in a society and continues to develop extensively for a prolonged period of time . The crisis tendencies of advanced capitalism stem from the three subsystems : economic crises from the economic system ; rationality and legitimation crises from the political system ; and motivation crises from the socio - cultural system .
