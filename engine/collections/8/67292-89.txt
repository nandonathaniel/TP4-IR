If two lines ( a and b ) are both perpendicular to a third line ( c ) , all of the angles formed along the third line are right angles . Therefore , in Euclidean geometry , any two lines that are both perpendicular to a third line are parallel to each other , because of the parallel postulate . Conversely , if one line is perpendicular to a second line , it is also perpendicular to any line parallel to that second line .
