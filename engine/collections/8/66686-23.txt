James Donovan Halliday a.k.a. Anorak : creator of OASIS . A big fan of 1980s culture , he announces in his will his plans to leave his entire fortune to whoever can find his Easter egg that he had hidden in OASIS . His character was initially inspired by Willy Wonka who Cline described as a `` rich eccentric holding a fantastic contest '' . Cline used the personalities of Howard Hughes and Richard Garriott , and placed Halliday 's birth year around the same as his own so that his pop culture interests would coincide with Cline 's `` and the other middle - aged uber geeks I know '' .
