The portrayal of Jesus ' death in John is unique among the four Gospels . It does not appear to rely on the kinds of atonement theology indicative of vicarious sacrifice ( cf . Mk 10 : 45 , Rom 3 : 25 ) but rather presents the death of Jesus as his glorification and return to the father . Likewise , the three `` passion predictions '' of the Synoptic Gospels ( Mk 8 : 31 , 9 : 31 , 10 : 33 -- 34 and pars . ) are replaced instead in John with three instances of Jesus explaining how he will be exalted or `` lifted up '' ( Jn 3 : 14 , 8 : 28 , 12 : 32 ) . The verb for `` lifted up '' reflects the double entendre at work in John 's theology of the cross , for Jesus is both physically elevated from the earth at the crucifixion but also , at the same time , exalted and glorified .
