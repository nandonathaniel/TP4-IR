The station 's new program director , Andy Travis , tries to turn around struggling radio station WKRP by switching its format from dated easy listening music to rock and roll , despite the well - meaning efforts of the mostly incompetent staff : bumbling station manager Arthur Carlson , greasy sales manager Herb Tarlek , and clueless news director Les Nessman . To help bolster ratings , Travis hires a new disc jockey , New Orleans native Gordon Sims ( Venus Flytrap ) ; and allows spaced - out former major market DJ Dr. Johnny Fever , already doing mornings in the easy listening format as John Caravella , to be himself . Rounding out the cast are super receptionist Jennifer Marlowe and enthusiastic junior employee Bailey Quarters . Lurking in the background and making an occasional appearance is ruthless business tycoon Mrs. Carlson , the station 's owner and the mother of Arthur Carlson .
