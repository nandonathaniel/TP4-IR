Richard D. Zanuck and David Brown , film producers at Universal Pictures , both heard about the book before publication at the same time . Upon reading it , both agreed the novel was exciting and deserved a feature film adaptation , even if they were unsure how to accomplish it . Benchley 's agent sold the adaptation rights for $150,000 , plus an extra $25,000 for Benchley to write the screenplay . Although this delighted the author , who had very little money at the time , it was a low sum , as the agreement occurred before the book became a surprise bestseller . After securing the rights , Steven Spielberg , who was making his first theatrical film , The Sugarland Express , for the Universal producers , was hired as the director . To play the protagonists , the producers cast Robert Shaw as Quint , Roy Scheider as Brody and Richard Dreyfuss as Hooper .
