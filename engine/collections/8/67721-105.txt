When players create World of Warcraft accounts , they are asked to choose a username and password . Afterward , whenever they play World of Warcraft , they are asked to supply the same username and password in full . This is also the case when using account management facilities online . This type of authentication is vulnerable to keystroke logging . While this is not unique to World of Warcraft and is common to many MMORPGs , the game has been directly targeted with trojans being specifically crafted to capture account login details . Attacks have been reported as early as May 2006 and may extend as far back as July 30 , 2005 . The game does , however , allow players to save their account name to the program to allow the player to only have to type their password .
