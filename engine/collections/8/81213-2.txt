Beach tourism , eco-tourism , cultural tourism , and sports tourism are all part of the tourism sector in Kenya . During the 1990s , the number of tourists travelling to Kenya decreased , partly due to the well - publicised murders of several tourists . However , tourism in Kenya is one of the leading sources of foreign exchange along with coffee .
