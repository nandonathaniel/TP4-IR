The Bank has a monopoly on the issue of banknotes in England and Wales . Scottish and Northern Irish banks retain the right to issue their own banknotes , but they must be backed one for one with deposits at the Bank , excepting a few million pounds representing the value of notes they had in circulation in 1845 . The Bank decided to sell its banknote printing operations to De La Rue in December 2002 , under the advice of Close Brothers Corporate Finance Ltd .
