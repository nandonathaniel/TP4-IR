Spielberg wanted `` some levity '' in Jaws , humor that would avoid making it `` a dark sea hunt '' , so he turned to his friend Carl Gottlieb , a comedy writer - actor then working on the sitcom The Odd Couple . Spielberg sent Gottlieb a script , asking what the writer would change and if there was a role he would be interested in performing . Gottlieb sent Spielberg three pages of notes , and picked the part of Meadows , the politically connected editor of the local paper . He passed the audition one week before Spielberg took him to meet the producers regarding a writing job .
