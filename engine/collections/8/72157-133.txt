Where Charles Darwin 's theories suggested a mechanism for improvement of species over generations , Mendel 's observations provided explanation for how a new species itself could emerge . Though Darwin and Mendel never collaborated , they were aware of each other 's work ( Darwin read a paper by Wilhelm Olbers Focke which extensively referenced Mendel ) . Bill Bryson wrote that `` without realizing it , Darwin and Mendel laid the groundwork for all of life sciences in the twentieth century . Darwin saw that all living things are connected , that ultimately they trace their ancestry to a single , common source ; Mendel 's work provided the mechanism to explain how that could happen . '' Biologist J.B.S. Haldane and others brought together the principles of Mendelian inheritance with Darwinian principles of evolution to form the field of genetics known as Modern evolutionary synthesis .
