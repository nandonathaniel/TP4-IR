Several other parades have a loose association with Thanksgiving , thanks to CBS 's now - discontinued All - American Thanksgiving Day Parade coverage . Parades that were covered during this era were the Aloha Floral Parade held in Honolulu , Hawaii every September , the Toronto Santa Claus Parade in Toronto , Ontario , Canada , and the Opryland Aqua Parade ( held from 1996 to 2001 by the Gaylord Opryland Resort & Convention Center in Nashville ) ; the Opryland parade was discontinued and replaced by a taped parade in Miami Beach , Florida in 2002 . A Disneyland parade was also featured on CBS until Disney purchased rival ABC .
