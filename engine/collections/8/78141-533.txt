Because there is no one governing or official body that regulates , recognizes , or awards national championships in college football , and because many independent selectors of championships exist , many of the claims by the schools listed below are shared , contradict each other , or are controversial . In addition , because there is no one body overseeing national championships , no standardized requirements exist in order for a school to make a claim on a national championship , as any particular institution is free to make any declaration it deems to be fit . However , all known national championship claims are for seasons in which a National Championship , or share of a championship , was believed to be awarded to that particular school by at least one independent third - party selector . The majority of these claims , but not all , are based on championships awarded from selectors listed as `` major '' in the official NCAA Football Bowl Subdivision Records . Not all championships awarded by third party selectors , nor those listed in the official NCAA Football Bowl Subdivision Records , are necessarily claimed by each school . Therefore , these claims represent how each individual school sees their own history on the subject of national championships .
