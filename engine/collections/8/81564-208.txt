After the 20 July attempt on Hitler 's life , and the close advance of the Red Army which would seize the site on 27 January 1945 , Hitler and his staff had been forced to abandon the Wolfsschanze headquarters in East Prussia , in which they had coordinated much of the fighting on the Eastern Front . After a brief visit to Berlin , Hitler travelled on his Führersonderzug ( `` Special Train of the Führer '' ( Leader ) ) to Giessen on 11 December , taking up residence in the Adlerhorst ( eyrie ) command complex , co-located with OB West 's base at Kransberg Castle . Believing in omens and the successes of his early war campaigns that had been planned at Kransberg , Hitler had chosen the site from which he had overseen the successful 1940 campaign against France and the Low Countries .
