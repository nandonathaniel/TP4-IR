Fish was not rationed , but prices increased considerably as the war progressed . The government initially allowed this , since it realised that fishermen would need to be able to collect a premium for their catch if they were at risk of enemy attack while at sea , but prices were controlled from 1941 . Like other non-rationed items , fish was rarely freely available , as supplies dropped to 30 % of pre-war levels , and long queues built up at fishmongers and fish and chip shops . The quality of wartime chips was often felt to be below standard , because of the low - quality fat available .
