That is what I meant by `` They contribute ... to the mass ... '' . The mass of a clothed particle maybe considered to be its bare mass plus the equivalent mass of the energy in its electric field . However , only the clothed mass is strictly definable . Bare mass would be negative infinity , and the self - energy of the electric field would be positive infinity , if one does not cut - off the integration at some minimal distance .
