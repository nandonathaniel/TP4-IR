Defensive coordinator Dave Campo was promoted to head coach for the 2000 season . Prior to the season starting cornerback Deion Sanders was released after 5 seasons with the team . He later signed with division rival Washington . In Week 1 , they were blown out 41 -- 14 by Philadelphia . That game was very costly when veteran quarterback Troy Aikman suffered a serious concussion which ultimately ended his career . Longtime NFL QB Randall Cunningham filled in for Aikman for the rest of the season at QB . The Cowboys finished the season in 4th place with a 5 -- 11 record . The only highlights of 2000 were Emmitt Smith having his 10th consecutive 1,000 yard rushing season and a season sweep over the Redskins .
