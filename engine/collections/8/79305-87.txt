Various gliders are seen in the film and the protagonist , Nausicaä , uses a jet - assisted one - person glider - shaped machine with folding wings . According to the accompanying film book released in Japan , the glider is called Möwe ( メーヴェ , Mēve , or `` mehve '' in the English manga ) , the German word meaning gull . An official scale model lists it as having an approximate wingspan of 5.8 meters ( 1 / 20 model measured to be 29 cm ) , while the design notes indicate it has a mass of only 12 kg . In 2004 , the Japanese - led OpenSky Aircraft Project began attempts to build a real - life , working personal jet glider based on the glider from the film . Two full - size gliders with no power source carrying the code name M01 and M02 , with a half - sized jet - powered remote controlled mock up called moewe 1 / 2 was built . The designer and tester of the project refused the official endorsement of the project by Studio Ghibli and Hayao Miyazaki , noting that he did not want to cause trouble for them if an accident occurred . A jet powered version ( registration number JX0122 ) was finally able to take off under its own power for the first time on 3 September 2013 .
