Under the Tang `` equal - field system '' all land was owned by the Emperor and granted to people according to household size . Men granted land were conscripted for military service for a fixed period each year , a military policy known as the `` Fubing system '' . These policies stimulated a rapid growth in productivity and a significant army without much burden on the state treasury . By the dynasty 's midpoint , however , standing armies had replaced conscription , and land was continuously falling into the hands of private owners .
