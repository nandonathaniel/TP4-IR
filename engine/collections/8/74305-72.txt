One of the last times I saw Futch was before the Floyd Mayweather Jr. -- Diego Corrales junior lightweight title bout in Vegas . Futch was talking about how much he admired Mayweather 's style , how Mayweather was such a beautiful boxer , able to slip along the ropes and avoid punches . Corrales said he was going to neutralize Mayweather 's hand speed by hitting Mayweather on the arms . ' I guess he thinks he 's going to stand there and let him hit him on the arms all night , ' said Futch , who correctly predicted that Mayweather would completely dismantle Corrales in a defensive masterpiece . Futch had a way of cutting to the heart of a matter . I do n't know anyone in boxing who wo n't miss him . I do n't know anyone in boxing that can take his place .
