The Southern Baptist Convention supported white supremacy and its results : disenfranchising most blacks and many poor whites at the turn of the 20th century by raising barriers to voter registration , and passage of racial segregation laws that enforced the system of Jim Crow . Its members largely resisted the civil rights movement in the South , which sought to enforce their constitutional rights for public access and voting ; and enforcement of midcentury federal civil rights laws .
