Despite early victories , Pyrrhus found his position in Italy untenable . Rome steadfastly refused to negotiate with Pyrrhus as long as his army remained in Italy . Facing unacceptably heavy losses from each encounter with the Roman army , Pyrrhus withdrew from the peninsula . In 275 BC , Pyrrhus again met the Roman army at the Battle of Beneventum . While Beneventum was indecisive , Pyrrhus realised his army had been exhausted and reduced by years of foreign campaigns . Seeing little hope for further gains , he withdrew completely from Italy .
