Cooper called in James Ashmore Creelman ( who was working on the script of The Most Dangerous Game at the time ) and the two men worked together on several drafts under the title The Eighth Wonder . Some details from Wallace 's rough draft were dropped , notably his boatload of escaped convicts . Wallace 's Danby Denham character , a big game hunter , became film director Carl Denham . His Shirley became Ann Darrow and her lover - convict John became Jack Driscoll . The ' beauty and the beast ' angle was first developed at this time . Kong 's escape was switched from Madison Square Garden to Yankee Stadium and ( finally ) to a Broadway theater . Cute moments involving the gorilla in Wallace 's draft were cut because Cooper wanted Kong hard and tough in the belief that his fall would be all the more awesome and tragic .
