The mitochondrion ( plural mitochondria ) is a double - membrane - bound organelle found in most eukaryotic organisms . Some cells in some multicellular organisms may however lack them ( for example , mature mammalian red blood cells ) . A number of unicellular organisms , such as microsporidia , parabasalids , and diplomonads , have also reduced or transformed their mitochondria into other structures . To date , only one eukaryote , Monocercomonoides , is known to have completely lost its mitochondria . The word mitochondrion comes from the Greek μίτος , mitos , `` thread '' , and χονδρίον , chondrion , `` granule '' or `` grain - like '' . Mitochondria generate most of the cell 's supply of adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) , used as a source of chemical energy .
