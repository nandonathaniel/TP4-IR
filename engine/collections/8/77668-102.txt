The plant is indigenous to South America and is said to originate from the area between southern Brazil and Paraguay ; however , little is known about the origin of the domesticated pineapple ( Pickersgill , 1976 ) . MS Bertoni ( 1919 ) considered the Paraná -- Paraguay River drainages to be the place of origin of A. comosus . The natives of southern Brazil and Paraguay spread the pineapple throughout South America , and it eventually reached the Caribbean , Central America , and Mexico , where it was cultivated by the Mayas and the Aztecs . Columbus encountered the pineapple in 1493 on the leeward island of Guadeloupe . He called it piña de Indes , meaning `` pine of the Indians '' , and brought it back with him to Spain , thus making the pineapple the first bromeliad to be introduced by humans outside of the New World . The Spanish introduced it into the Philippines , Hawaii ( introduced in the early 19th century , first commercial plantation 1886 ) , Zimbabwe , and Guam . The fruit is said to have been first introduced in Hawaii when a Spanish ship brought it there in the 1500s . The Portuguese took the fruit from Brazil and introduced it into India by 1550 .
