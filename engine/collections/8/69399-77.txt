In the Low Middle Ages , Catalan went through a golden age , reaching a peak of maturity and cultural richness . Examples include the work of Majorcan polymath Ramon Llull ( 1232 -- 1315 ) , the Four Great Chronicles ( 13th -- 14th centuries ) , and the Valencian school of poetry culminating in Ausi√†s March ( 1397 -- 1459 ) . By the 15th century , the city of Valencia had become the sociocultural center of the Crown of Aragon , and Catalan was present all over the Mediterranean world . During this period , the Royal Chancery propagated a highly standardized language . Catalan was widely used as an official language in Sicily until the 15th century , and in Sardinia until the 17th . During this period , the language was what Costa Carreras terms `` one of the ' great languages ' of medieval Europe '' .
