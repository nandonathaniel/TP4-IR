In an interview with National Public Radio on October 30 , 2015 , Adam Pertman , president and CEO of the National Center on Adoption and Permanency , indicated that many young girls were adopted by citizens of other countries , particularly the United States , a trend which has been declining for some years . `` The infant girls of yesteryear have not been available , if you will , for five , seven years . China has been ... trying to keep the girls within the country ... And the consequence is that , today , rather than those young girls who used to be available -- primarily girls -- today , it 's older children , children with special needs , children in sibling groups . It 's very , very different . ''
