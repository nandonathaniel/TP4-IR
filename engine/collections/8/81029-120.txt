SB 869 , newly signed by Governor Brown , makes it a crime ( infraction with a fine up to $1,000 ) to leave a firearm in an unattended vehicle unless it has been either 1 . locked in the trunk , 2 . stored in a locked container that is placed out of plain view or 3 . stored in a locked container that is permanently affixed to the interior of the vehicle and not in plain view . The specific language of the new law can be found in Penal Code Section 25140 . Active peace officers are specifically called out as not being exempt , unless in the event that immediate aid is required that is within the course of their employment . Likely , this law will be enforced upon the report that a firearm was stolen out of a vehicle , in which case the owner will be held responsible .
