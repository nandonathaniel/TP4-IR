In the mini challenge , each contestant is asked to perform a different task with varying requirements and time limitations . Certain mini challenges are repeated from season to season . For instance , the first mini challenge of the first six seasons is a photo shoot with the photographer Mike Ruiz that includes some kind of special twist ( such as being doused with water while in full drag , having a high - powered fan turned on during the shoot , or being photographed while jumping on a trampoline ) . Another recurring mini challenge is dedicated to `` reading , '' a drag term for making insulting observations about one 's peers for comedic effect . The winner of a mini challenge is sometimes rewarded with some kind of advantage in the main challenge . Though most episodes have a mini challenge , select episodes do not and progress straight to the main challenge .
