The four girls are demoted back to basics after they make a big deal out of saving the prince in Part 1 . They are not allowed on any mission , even as a suspicious figure , Carson Lazarus , a criminal mastermind , is released from jail . Soon after , a figure who calls themselves `` Retro '' causes all technology to malfunction and glitch in Maywood Glen . The girls strongly suspect that the two are linked . The video shows that in the background , there is something labeled `` Property of MGA '' -- where MGA stands for Maywood Glen Academy -- and it is very possible that Retro is a student at the academy . Meanwhile , McKeyla tries to fit in and becomes `` study buddies '' with Kyle Lewis , a rather awkward and suspicious teenager .
