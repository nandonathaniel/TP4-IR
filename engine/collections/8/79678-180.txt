One of the biggest oversights of the entire system was the lack of adequate air - sea rescue organisation . The RAF had started organising a system in 1940 with High Speed Launches ( HSLs ) based on flying boat bases and at a number of overseas locations , but it was still believed that the amount of cross-Channel traffic meant that there was no need for a rescue service to cover these areas . Downed pilots and aircrew , it was hoped , would be picked up by any boats or ships which happened to be passing by . Otherwise the local life boat would be alerted , assuming someone had seen the pilot going into the water .
