Great Britain planned a `` descent '' ( an amphibious demonstration or raid ) on Rochefort , a joint operation to overrun the town and burn shipping in the Charente . The expedition set out on 8 September 1757 , Sir John Mordaunt commanding the troops and Sir Edward Hawke the fleet . On 23 September the Isle d'Aix was taken , but military staff dithered and lost so much time that Rochefort became unassailable . The expedition abandoned the Isle d'Aix , returning to Great Britain on 1 October .
