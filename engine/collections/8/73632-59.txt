On stage 12 to Mont Ventoux ( which was shortened to Chalet Reynard due to high winds ) , Froome was involved in a crash involving a stopped motorbike that also sent Richie Porte and Bauke Mollema down . With no usable bike , Froome had no choice but to run partway up the mountain until he was able to get a spare bike from his team car . Provisionally he had fallen to sixth place overall which would have given the yellow jersey to Adam Yates , however race officials decided to give him and Porte the same time as Mollema , ensuring Froome would hold on to his first overall position .
