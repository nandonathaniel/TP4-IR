The theme song `` The Good Ol ' Boys '' was written and performed by Waylon Jennings . He was also `` The Balladeer '' ( as credited ) , and served as narrator of the show . However , the version released as a single is not the same version that was used in the show 's opening credits ; the single version has a repeat of the chorus and an instrumental to pad out the length , uses a different instrumental mix that emphasizes the bass , and replaces the last verse with an inside joke about how the TV show producers `` keep on showing ( Jennings 's ) hands and not ( his ) face on TV .
