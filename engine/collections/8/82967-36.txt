Electric companies often prefer to use cooling water from the ocean , a lake , or a river , or a cooling pond , instead of a cooling tower . This single pass or once - through cooling system can save the cost of a cooling tower and may have lower energy costs for pumping cooling water through the plant 's heat exchangers . However , the waste heat can cause thermal pollution as the water is discharged . Power plants using natural bodies of water for cooling are designed with mechanisms such as fish screens , to limit intake of organisms into the cooling machinery . These screens are only partially effective and as a result billions of fish and other aquatic organisms are killed by power plants each year . For example , the cooling system at the Indian Point Energy Center in New York kills over a billion fish eggs and larvae annually .
