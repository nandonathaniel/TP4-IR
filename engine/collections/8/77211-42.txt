As in The Dark Side of the Moon , the band used synthesizers such as the EMS VCS 3 ( on `` Welcome to the Machine '' ) , but softened with Gilmour 's acoustic guitar and percussion from Mason . The beginning of `` Shine On '' contains remnants from a previous but incomplete studio recording by the band known as `` Household Objects '' . Wine glasses had been filled with varying amounts of fluid , and recordings were made of a wet finger circling the edge of each glass . These recordings were multi-tracked into chords , and used in the opening of `` Shine On '' .
