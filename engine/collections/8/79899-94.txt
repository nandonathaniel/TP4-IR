The apartments of the King were the heart of the chateau ; they were in the same location as the rooms of Louis XIII , the creator of the chateau , on the first floor ( second floor US style ) . They were set aside the personal use of Louis XIV in 1683 . He and his successors Louis XV and Louis XVI , used these rooms for official functions , such as the ceremonial lever ( `` Waking Up '' ) and the coucher ( `` Going to bed '' ) of the monarch , which were attended by a crowd of courtiers .
