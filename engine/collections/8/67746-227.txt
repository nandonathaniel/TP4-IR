A screening survey across 13 countries by the World Health Organization using DSM - IV criteria , reported in 2009 a prevalence estimate of around 6 % for personality disorders . The rate sometimes varied with demographic and socioeconomic factors , and functional impairment was partly explained by co-occurring mental disorders . In the US , screening data from the National Comorbidity Survey Replication between 2001 and 2003 , combined with interviews of a subset of respondents , indicated a population prevalence of around 9 % for personality disorders in total . Functional disability associated with the diagnoses appeared to be largely due to co-occurring mental disorders ( Axis I in the DSM ) .
