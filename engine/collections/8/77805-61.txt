Prior to the start of his junior year , James appeared in SLAM Magazine and writer Ryan Jones lauded him as possibly `` the best high school basketball player in America right now '' . During the season , he appeared on the cover of Sports Illustrated , becoming the first high school basketball underclassman to do so . With averages of 29 points , 8.3 rebounds , 5.7 assists , and 3.3 steals per game , he was again named Ohio Mr. Basketball and selected to the USA Today All - USA First Team , and became the first junior to be named boys ' basketball Gatorade National Player of the Year . St. Vincent - St. Mary finished the year with a 23 -- 4 record , ending their season with a loss in the Division II championship game . Following the loss , James unsuccessfully petitioned for a change to the NBA 's draft eligibility rules , which required prospective players to have at least a high school diploma , in an attempt to enter the 2002 NBA draft . During this time , he used marijuana , which he said was to help cope with the stress that resulted from the constant media attention he was receiving .
