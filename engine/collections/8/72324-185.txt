It followed and capitalized on the February Revolution of the same year , which overthrew the Tsarist autocracy and resulted in a provisional government after a transfer of power proclaimed by Grand Duke Michael , brother of Tsar Nicolas II , who declined to take power after the Tsar stepped down . During this time , urban workers began to organize into councils ( soviets ) wherein revolutionaries criticized the provisional government and its actions . After the Congress of Soviets , now the governing body , had its second session , it elected members of the Bolsheviks and other leftist groups such as the Left Socialist Revolutionaries to important positions within the new state of affairs . This immediately initiated the establishment of the Russian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic , the world 's first self - proclaimed socialist state . On 17 July 1918 , the Tsar and his family were executed .
