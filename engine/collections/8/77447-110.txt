In terms of social structure , the Industrial Revolution witnessed the triumph of a middle class of industrialists and businessmen over a landed class of nobility and gentry . Ordinary working people found increased opportunities for employment in the new mills and factories , but these were often under strict working conditions with long hours of labour dominated by a pace set by machines . As late as the year 1900 , most industrial workers in the United States still worked a 10 - hour day ( 12 hours in the steel industry ) , yet earned from 20 % to 40 % less than the minimum deemed necessary for a decent life ; however , most workers in textiles , which was by far the leading industry in terms of employment , were women and children . Also , harsh working conditions were prevalent long before the Industrial Revolution took place . Pre-industrial society was very static and often cruel -- child labour , dirty living conditions , and long working hours were just as prevalent before the Industrial Revolution .
