In the late 19th and early 20th century , Bulgaria and Greece contended for Ottoman Macedonia and Thrace . Ethnic Greeks sought the forced `` Hellenization '' of ethnic Bulgars , who sought `` Bulgarization '' of Greeks ( Rise of nationalism ) . Both nations sent armed irregulars into Ottoman territory to protect and assist their ethnic kindred . From 1904 , there was low intensity warfare in Macedonia between the Greek and Bulgarian bands and the Ottoman army ( the Struggle for Macedonia ) . After the Young Turk revolution of July 1908 , the situation changed drastically .
