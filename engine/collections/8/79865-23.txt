Gradually it came to be suspected that the heat inevitably generated by motion under friction was another form of vis viva . In 1783 , Antoine Lavoisier and Pierre - Simon Laplace reviewed the two competing theories of vis viva and caloric theory . Count Rumford 's 1798 observations of heat generation during the boring of cannons added more weight to the view that mechanical motion could be converted into heat , and ( as importantly ) that the conversion was quantitative and could be predicted ( allowing for a universal conversion constant between kinetic energy and heat ) . Vis viva then started to be known as energy , after the term was first used in that sense by Thomas Young in 1807 .
