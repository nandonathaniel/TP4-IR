Beginning in 2017 , the National Hurricane Center ( NHC ) has the option to issue advisories , and thus allow watches and warnings to be issued , on disturbances that are not yet tropical cyclones but have a high chance to become one , and are expected to bring tropical storm or hurricane conditions to landmasses within 48 hours . Such systems are termed `` potential tropical cyclones '' . Advisories on these storms contain the same content , including track forecasts and cyclone watches and warnings , as advisories on active tropical cyclones . The first storm to receive this designation was Potential Tropical Cyclone Two , which later developed into Tropical Storm Bret , east - southeast of the Windward Islands on June 18 . In addition , the numbering that a potential tropical cyclone receives would be retained for the rest of the hurricane season , meaning that the next tropical system would be designated with the following number , even though potential tropical cyclones do not qualify as tropical cyclones . This was first demonstrated with Potential Tropical Cyclone Ten , which failed to develop into a tropical cyclone .
