Not all courts and tribunals have jurisdiction to hear constitutional challenges . The court , at the very least , must have jurisdiction to apply the law . In N.S. v. Martin ; N.S. v. Laseur ( 2003 ) the Supreme Court re-articulated the test for constitutional jurisdiction from Cooper v. Canada ( Human Rights Commission ) . The inquiry must begin by determining whether the enabling legislation gives explicit authority to apply the law . If so , then the court may apply the constitution . The second line of inquiry looks into whether there was implied authority to apply the law . This can be found by examining the text of the Act , its context , and the general nature and characteristics of the adjudicative body .
