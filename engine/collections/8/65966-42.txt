As a result of the negotiations , both sides agreed to retain joint military occupation of the island until a final settlement could be reached , reducing their presence to a token force of no more than 100 men . The `` English Camp '' was established on the north end of San Juan Island along the shoreline , for ease of supply and access ; and the `` American Camp '' was created on the south end on a high , windswept meadow , suitable for artillery barrages against shipping . Today the Union Jack still flies above the `` English Camp '' , being raised and lowered daily by park rangers , making it one of the few places without diplomatic status where U.S. government employees regularly hoist the flag of another country .
