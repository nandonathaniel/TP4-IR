There is no consistent rule or view on Halloween amongst those who describe themselves as Neopagans or Wiccans . Some Neopagans do not observe Halloween , but instead observe Samhain on 1 November , some neopagans do enjoy Halloween festivities , stating that one can observe both `` the solemnity of Samhain in addition to the fun of Halloween '' . Some neopagans are opposed to the celebration of Hallowe'en , stating that it `` trivializes Samhain '' , and `` avoid Halloween , because of the interruptions from trick or treaters '' . The Manitoban writes that `` Wiccans do n't officially celebrate Halloween , despite the fact that 31 Oct. will still have a star beside it in any good Wiccan 's day planner . Starting at sundown , Wiccans celebrate a holiday known as Samhain . Samhain actually comes from old Celtic traditions and is not exclusive to Neopagan religions like Wicca . While the traditions of this holiday originate in Celtic countries , modern day Wiccans do n't try to historically replicate Samhain celebrations . Some traditional Samhain rituals are still practised , but at its core , the period is treated as a time to celebrate darkness and the dead -- a possible reason why Samhain can be confused with Halloween celebrations .
