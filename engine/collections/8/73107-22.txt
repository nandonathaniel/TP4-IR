The part of the plant that first emerges from the seed is the embryonic root , termed the radicle or primary root . It allows the seedling to become anchored in the ground and start absorbing water . After the root absorbs water , an embryonic shoot emerges from the seed . This shoot comprises three main parts : the cotyledons ( seed leaves ) , the section of shoot below the cotyledons ( hypocotyl ) , and the section of shoot above the cotyledons ( epicotyl ) . The way the shoot emerges differs among plant groups .
