Del , Rodney , and Albert are mistakenly apprehended as shoplifters by an overzealous security guard at the Top Buy Supermarket . And things get worse when they are taken to the manager 's office and realise that they have lost their receipt for the goods . Shortly after , Tom the security guard brings a cocky shoplifter , Lennox Gilbey , into the manager 's office , where he promptly pulls out a gun and demands money from the safe . Unluckily for Lennox the safe is on a time - lock and due to the dodgy watch he is wearing , he is 15 minutes later than he planned -- and the safe does not open until 8 am the next morning . After being held hostage throughout the night , Del realises that he sold the stolen watch to Lennox , and that he also knew him as a kid . By preying on his guilty conscience , Del persuades Lennox to reveal that the plan was hatched by Tom and the supermarket manager to get at the £ 60,000 stored in the safe . The three accomplices beg Del not to go to the police , and instead , he arranges for Lennox to get a job as security guard at the supermarket after Tom 's retirement , and then makes sure he wins a £ 1,000 prize as the millionth customer in the store .
