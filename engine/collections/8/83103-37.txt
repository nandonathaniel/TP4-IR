Unknown to Mendeleev , a German chemist , Lothar Meyer , was also working on a periodic table . Although his work was published in 1864 , and was done independently of Mendeleev , few historians regard him as an equal co-creator of the periodic table . Meyer 's table only included twenty - eight elements , which were not classified by atomic weight , but by valence , and he never reached the idea of predicting new elements and correcting atomic weights . A few months after Mendeleev published his periodic table of the known elements , predicted new elements to help complete his table and corrected the atomic weights of some of the elements , Meyer published a virtually identical periodic table .
