The 150th anniversary of Bell 's birth in 1997 was marked by a special issue of commemorative Â£ 1 banknotes from the Royal Bank of Scotland . The illustrations on the reverse of the note include Bell 's face in profile , his signature , and objects from Bell 's life and career : users of the telephone over the ages ; an audio wave signal ; a diagram of a telephone receiver ; geometric shapes from engineering structures ; representations of sign language and the phonetic alphabet ; the geese which helped him to understand flight ; and the sheep which he studied to understand genetics . Additionally , the Government of Canada honored Bell in 1997 with a C $100 gold coin , in tribute also to the 150th anniversary of his birth , and with a silver dollar coin in 2009 in honor of the 100th anniversary of flight in Canada . That first flight was made by an airplane designed under Dr. Bell 's tutelage , named the Silver Dart . Bell 's image , and also those of his many inventions have graced paper money , coinage , and postal stamps in numerous countries worldwide for many dozens of years .
