After launching in the 1930s , Rowntree 's Chocolate Crisp was originally advertised as `` the biggest little meal '' and `` the best companion to a cup of tea '' . During World War II , Kit Kat was depicted as a valuable wartime foodstuff , with the slogan `` what active people need '' . ' Kitty the Kat ' arrived in the late 1940s to emphasise the `` rich full cream milk '' qualities of the bar and , thanks to contemporary improvements in production methods , also highlighted the new and improved ' snap ' by responding to a biscuit being broken off screen . The first Kit Kat poster appeared in 1951 , and the first colour TV advertisement appeared in 1969 .
