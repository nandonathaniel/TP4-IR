Florida City was historically bisected by a slough . Sloughs were commonly found crossing the limestone ridge at a roughly perpendicular angle from Miami to Florida City . Florida City 's slough ( officially called `` Long Slough '' or `` Long Glade Slough '' ) entered the city near Redland Road and Lucy Street , and extended across the city to the southeast to a location near today 's NW 3rd Street and NW 3rd Avenue . East of that point , the slough entered the East Glade .
