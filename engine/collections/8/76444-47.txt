In February 2015 , Marvel pushed back the release date to November 2 , 2018 . In early April , Feige revealed that Captain Marvel appeared in an early draft of the Avengers : Age of Ultron screenplay , but was removed as `` it did n't feel like the time . We did n't want to introduce her fully formed flying in a costume before you knew who she was or how she came to be . '' He also said that Marvel would be ready to announce writers for the film `` hopefully in the next week or two '' , and by mid-April , Guardians of the Galaxy co-screenwriter Nicole Perlman and Inside Out co-screenwriter Meg LeFauve were announced to be writing the screenplay . The duo were put together as a writing team after impressing Feige with separate takes on the character , and began work on the film within a month . LeFauve found the character being a female superhero to be both `` wonderful '' and a challenge , particularly because of how powerful the character is which could lead to the `` Superman curse . ' What 's her vulnerability ? ' is what we have to figure out . ''
