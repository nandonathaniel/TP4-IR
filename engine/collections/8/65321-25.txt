Viola is not alone among Shakespeare 's cross-dressing heroines ; in Shakespeare 's theatre , convention dictated that adolescent boys play the roles of female characters , creating humour in the multiplicity of disguise found in a female character who for a while pretended at masculinity . Her cross dressing enables Viola to fulfill usually male roles , such as acting as a messenger between Orsino and Olivia , as well as being Orsino 's confidant . She does not , however , use her disguise to enable her to intervene directly in the plot ( unlike other Shakespearean heroines such as Rosalind in As You Like It and Portia in The Merchant of Venice ) , remaining someone who allows `` Time '' to untangle the plot . Viola 's persistence in transvestism through her betrothal in the final scene of the play often engenders a discussion of the possibly homoerotic relationship between Viola and Orsino .
