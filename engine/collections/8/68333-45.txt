The recycling of the railway into an urban park has brought on the revitalization of Chelsea , which had been `` gritty '' and in generally poor condition in the late twentieth century . It has also spurred real estate development in the neighborhoods that lie along the line . Mayor Bloomberg noted that the High Line project has helped usher in something of a renaissance in the neighborhood : by 2009 , more than 30 projects were planned or under construction nearby , and by 2016 , more than 11 projects were under construction . It has also helped to raise the prices of properties directly adjacent to the High Line by an average of 10 % compared to properties located a few blocks away . Since the park 's opening in 2009 , there have been at least 20 properties abutting the High Line that have sold for at least $10 million , with the average apartment in a building directly adjacent to the park selling for $6 million . Apartments located near Phase 1 of the High Line are , on average , more than twice as costly as apartments located between Seventh and Eighth Avenues , two blocks to the east . As of August 2016 , the park has continued to increase real estate values and prices along the route , as a `` halo effect '' .
