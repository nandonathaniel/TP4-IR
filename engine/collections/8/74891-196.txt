The water supply in South Sudan is faced with numerous challenges . It is estimated that between 50 % and 60 % of the population of South Sudan has access to an improved water source , such as a hand pump , a protected well or -- for a small minority -- piped water supply . Although the White Nile runs through the country , water is scarce during the dry season in areas that are not located on the river .
