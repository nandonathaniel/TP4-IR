`` The IAU therefore resolves that planets and other bodies in our Solar System , except satellites , be defined into three distinct categories in the following way : ( 1 ) A `` planet '' is a celestial body that : ( a ) is in orbit around the Sun , ( b ) has sufficient mass for its self - gravity to overcome rigid body forces so that it assumes a hydrostatic equilibrium ( nearly round ) shape , and ( c ) has cleared the neighbourhood around its orbit . ( 2 ) A `` dwarf planet '' is a celestial body that : ( a ) is in orbit around the Sun , ( b ) has sufficient mass for its self - gravity to overcome rigid body forces so that it assumes a hydrostatic equilibrium ( nearly round ) shape , ( c ) has not cleared the neighbourhood around its orbit , and ( d ) is not a satellite . ( 3 ) All other objects , except satellites , orbiting the Sun shall be referred to collectively as `` Small Solar System Bodies '' . Footnotes : The eight planets are : Mercury , Venus , Earth , Mars , Jupiter , Saturn , Uranus , and Neptune . An IAU process will be established to assign borderline objects into either `` dwarf planet '' and other categories . These currently include most of the Solar System asteroids , most Trans - Neptunian Objects ( TNOs ) , comets , and other small bodies . The IAU further resolves : Pluto is a `` dwarf planet '' by the above definition and is recognised as the prototype of a new category of trans - Neptunian objects . ''
