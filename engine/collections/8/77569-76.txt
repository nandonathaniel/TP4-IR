According to the London Spectator , U.S. journalists in Central America had long known that the CIA was flying in supplies to the Contras inside Nicaragua before the scandal broke . No journalist paid it any attention until the alleged CIA supply man , Eugene Hasenfus , was shot down and captured by the Nicaraguan army . Similarly , reporters neglected to investigate many leads indicating that Oliver North was running the Contra operation from his office in the National Security Council .
