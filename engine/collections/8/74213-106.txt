Entertainment Weekly 's Ken Tucker gave it a B+ , saying , `` The acting is strikingly good '' and that `` ( s ) ome viewers may find The Killing a little too cold and deliberate , but give it time . Its intensity builds steadily , giving the series unexpected power . '' Alex Strachan of The Vancouver Sun said the series `` is soaked in atmosphere and steeped in the stark realism of Scandinavian crime novelists Henning Mankell and Stieg Larsson '' and that it `` is not as much about a young girl 's murder as it is a psychological study of what happens afterward , how a tight - knit community tries to recover and how a dead child 's mother , father and siblings learn to deal with their pain in their own private ways . '' Matt Roush of TV Guide applauded the series , calling the acting `` tremendous '' and saying that he `` was instantly hooked by the moody atmosphere of this season - long murder mystery set in Seattle . '' He went on to say , `` What really stands out for me , in this age of cookie - cutter procedurals , is how The Killing dramatizes the devastation a violent death has on a family , a community , on the people involved in the investigation . Nothing about this show is routine . ''
