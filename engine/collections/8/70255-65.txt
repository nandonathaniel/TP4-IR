The liability of potential leak ( s ) is one of the largest barriers to large - scale CCS . To assess and reduce such liability , the leakage of stored gasses , particularly carbon dioxide , into the atmosphere may be detected via atmospheric gas monitoring , and can be quantified directly via the eddy covariance flux measurements ,
