There were several causes for the U.S. declaration of war : First , a series of trade restrictions introduced by Britain to impede American trade with France , a country with which Britain was at war ( the U.S. contested these restrictions as illegal under international law ) ; second , the impressment ( forced recruitment ) of U.S. seamen into the Royal Navy ; third , the British military support for American Indians who were offering armed resistance to the expansion of the American frontier to the Northwest ; fourth , a possible desire on the part of the United States to annex Canada . An implicit but powerful motivation for the Americans was the desire to uphold national honor in the face of what they considered to be British insults ( such as the Chesapeake affair ) .
