The Iraq -- Kuwait dispute also involved Iraqi claims to Kuwait as Iraqi territory . Kuwait had been a part of the Ottoman Empire 's province of Basra , something that Iraq claimed made it rightful Iraqi territory . Its ruling dynasty , the al - Sabah family , had concluded a protectorate agreement in 1899 that assigned responsibility for its foreign affairs to the United Kingdom . The UK drew the border between the two countries in 1922 , making Iraq virtually landlocked . Kuwait rejected Iraqi attempts to secure further provisions in the region .
