Against the clergymen 's assertion that demonstrations could be illegal , King argued that not only was civil disobedience justified in the face of unjust laws , but it was necessary and even patriotic . `` I submit that an individual who breaks a law that conscience tells him is unjust , and who willingly accepts the penalty of imprisonment in order to arouse the conscience of the community over its injustice , is in reality expressing the highest respect for law . '' King stated that an unjust law was a law that degraded a human personality . Citing Augustine of Canterbury , Thomas Aquinas , Martin Buber , and Paul Tillich -- and examples from the past and present -- King described what makes laws just or unjust . For example , `` A law is unjust if it is inflicted on a minority that , as a result of being denied the right to vote , had no part in enacting or devising the law . '' In terms of obedience to the law , King stated that citizens have `` not only a legal but a moral responsibility to obey just laws , '' and at the same time `` to disobey unjust laws . '' King stated that it is not morally wrong to disobey a law that pertains to one group of people differently than another . Alabama has used `` all sorts of devious methods '' to deny its black citizens their right to vote and thus preserve its unjust laws and broader system of white supremacy . Segregation laws are immoral and unjust `` because segregation distorts the soul and damages the personality . It gives the segregator a false sense of superiority and the segregated a false sense of inferiority . '' Even some just laws , such as permit requirements for public marches , are unjust when used to uphold an unjust system .
