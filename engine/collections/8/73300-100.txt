The Jesuits operated their properties as an integrated unit with the larger Jesuit order ; thus revenues from haciendas funded their colegios . Jesuits did significantly expand missions to the indigenous in the northern frontier area and a number were martyred , but the crown supported those missions . Mendicant orders that had real estate were less economically integrated , so that some individual houses were wealthy while others struggled economically . The Franciscans , who were founded as an order embracing poverty , did not accumulate real estate , unlike the Augustinians and Dominicans in Mexico .
