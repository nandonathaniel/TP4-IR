In 1811 , iodine was discovered by French chemist Bernard Courtois , who was born to a manufacturer of saltpeter ( an essential component of gunpowder ) . At the time of the Napoleonic Wars , saltpeter was in great demand in France . Saltpeter produced from French nitre beds required sodium carbonate , which could be isolated from seaweed collected on the coasts of Normandy and Brittany . To isolate the sodium carbonate , seaweed was burned and the ash washed with water . The remaining waste was destroyed by adding sulfuric acid . Courtois once added excessive sulfuric acid and a cloud of purple vapour rose . He noted that the vapour crystallised on cold surfaces , making dark crystals . Courtois suspected that this material was a new element but lacked funding to pursue it further .
