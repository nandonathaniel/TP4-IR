Many modern motorcycles feature a device called quickshifter for up - shifts without pressing the clutch lever or closing the throttle . The special sensor recognizes pressure on the gear shift rod and quickshifter sends a signal to the ECU to either stop fuelling for a short time ( milliseconds ) or suppress the spark at the plug , which unloads the gearbox and allows a gear change . The idea came from racing where it helps to minimize the time when the motorcycle is not at full power . An alternative device for down - shifts is called auto - blipper and is less widespread . It artificially `` blips '' the throttle to match engine speed to speed of the rear wheel to avoid sudden spikes in torque transfer .
