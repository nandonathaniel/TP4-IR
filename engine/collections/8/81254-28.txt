The halo ring is the innermost and the vertically thickest Jovian ring . Its outer edge coincides with the inner boundary of the main ring approximately at the radius 7008122500000000000 ♠ 122 500 km ( 1.72 R ) . From this radius the ring becomes rapidly thicker towards Jupiter . The true vertical extent of the halo is not known but the presence of its material was detected as high as 7007100000000000000 ♠ 10 000 km over the ring plane . The inner boundary of the halo is relatively sharp and located at the radius 7008100000000000000 ♠ 100 000 km ( 1.4 R ) , but some material is present further inward to approximately 7007920000000000000 ♠ 92 000 km . Thus the width of the halo ring is about 7007300000000000000 ♠ 30 000 km . Its shape resembles a thick torus without clear internal structure . In contrast to the main ring , the halo 's appearance depends only slightly on the viewing geometry .
