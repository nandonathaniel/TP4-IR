Compared with chemotherapy or other anti-cancer drugs , there are a lot of advantages of siRNA drug . SiRNA acts on the post-translational stage of gene expression , so it does n't modify or change DNA in a deleterious effect . SiRNA can also be used to produced a specific response in a certain type of way , such as by downgrading suppression of gene expression . In a single cancer cell , siRNA can cause dramatic suppression of gene expression with just several copies . This happens by silencing cancer - promoting genes with RNAi , as well as targeting an mRNA sequence .
