Crowley often told the story of an October 28 , 1922 , game between Notre Dame and Georgia Tech in which the Fighting Irish players said Hail Mary prayers together before scoring each of the touchdowns , before winning the game 13 - 3 . According to Crowley , it was one of the team 's linemen , Noble Kizer ( a Presbyterian ) , who suggested praying before the first touchdown , which occurred on a fourth and goal play at the Tech 6 - yard line during the second quarter . Quarterback Harry Stuhldreher , another of the Horsemen , threw a quick pass over the middle to Paul Castner for the score . The ritual was repeated before a third and goal play , again at Tech 's six , in the fourth quarter . This time Stuhldreher ran for a touchdown , which sealed the win for Notre Dame . After the game , Kizer exclaimed to Crowley , `` Say , that Hail Mary is the best play we 've got . '' Crowley related this story many times in public speeches beginning in the 1930s .
