Grounded for Life was initially released on VHS in North America . In early 2006 , Anchor Bay Entertainment began making the series available on DVD , with all five season being released by late 2007 . The first season included all 20 episodes that were originally produced for that season ( five of these episodes , prior to the season finale were included as part of season two in the television airings ) . However , since the opening titles are different in seasons one and two , these five episodes included , still carry the season two opening titles . The season two set , therefore contains 17 episodes . Season three contains 13 episodes , two of which did not originally air on television . All 28 episodes that aired as part of season four , remain intact for the season four set and the same for the 13 - episode season five set . The first four seasons were released in box set format , with two smaller - than - standard size DVD cases with a slipcover for each of the four sets . This however changed for the season five release when it was made available in a standard DVD case and no slipcover . Anchor Bay never released a complete series set . Each of these releases are now out of print .
