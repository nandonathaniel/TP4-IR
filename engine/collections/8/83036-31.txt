Lawrence Fletcher ( voiced by Richard O'Brien ) is the father of Ferb and stepfather of Phineas and Candace . Lawrence sells antiques , is from the United Kingdom and is portrayed like a sitcom dad as being scatterbrained and unaware of what is going on . He often agrees to follow Phineas 's instructions and even forces Candace to cooperate as if he considers Phineas and Ferb 's skills normal . Unlike the boys ' mother , he has seen some of the boys ' inventions ; he has not reacted negatively , and apparently believes that their mother approves . His precise surname is a matter of some dispute ; in at least one episode , Isabella addresses him as `` Mr. Flynn '' . Jeff `` Swampy '' Marsh has said that Lawrence Fletcher is very similar to his stepfather , Bill .
