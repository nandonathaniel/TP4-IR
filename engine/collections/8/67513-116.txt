In Zero Hour , Nero talked to the Prime Minister ( a former H.I.V.E. pupil ) and managed to get Otto and the other Alphas unrestricted access to GCHQ , so that they could use the equipment there to activate Nero 's plan `` Zero Hour '' in order to stop Overlord . Although the team of Alphas did manage to activate Zero Hour , the Prime Minister betrayed them , which led to the capture of Otto , Laura and Lucy by the Disciples .
