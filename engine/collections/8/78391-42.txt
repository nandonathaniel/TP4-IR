Other notable actors who have played the Tin Woodman include Oliver Hardy in a 1925 silent version of The Wizard of Oz directed by and starring Larry Semon , in which a villainous farmhand briefly fell into a tin pile and emerged as a `` Tin Woodsman '' ( sic ) . In subsequent scenes the tin was removed and he became `` Knight of the Garter '' . In the 1960 television adaptation of The Land of Oz , he was played by vaudeville comedian Gil Lamb ; in the 1969 film , The Wonderful Land of Oz he was played by Al Joseph ; and in the 1985 film Return to Oz , he was played by Deep Roy , a little person who was able to fit inside a costume that looked nearly identical to John R. Neill 's artwork .
