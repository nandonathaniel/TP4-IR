The Western Chalukya Empire under Satyashraya and Someshvara I tried to wriggle out of Chola domination from time to time , primarily due to the Chola influence in the Vengi kingdom . The Western Chalukyas mounted several unsuccessful attempts to engage the Chola emperors in war , and except for a brief occupation of Vengi territories between 1118 -- 1126 , all their other attempts ended in failure with successive Chola emperors routing the armies of the Chalukyas at various places in many wars . Virarajendra Chola defeated Someshvara II of the Western Chalukya Empire and made an alliance with Prince Vikramaditya VI . Cholas always successfully controlled the Chalukyas in the western Deccan by defeating them in war and levying tribute on them . Even under the emperors of the Cholas like Kulothunga I and Vikrama Chola , the wars against the Chalukyas were mainly fought in Chalukya territories in Karnataka or in the Telugu country like Vengi , Kakinada , Anantapur , or Gutti . Then the former feudatories like the Hoysalas , Yadvas , and Kakatiyas steadily increased their power and finally replaced the Chalukyas . With the occupation of Dharwar in North Central Karnataka by the Hoysalas under Vishnuvardhana , where he based himself with his son Narasimha I in - charge at the Hoysala capital Dwarasamudra around 1149 , and with the Kalachuris occupying the Chalukyan capital for over 35 years from around 1150 -- 1151 , the Chalukya kingdom was already starting to dissolve .
