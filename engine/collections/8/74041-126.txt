The M3 had the significant disadvantage of its 75 mm main armament being mounted offset in the hull meaning that it could not take hull down cover and use its main gun at the same time . It had a fully traversable turret with a 37 mm cannon as well , but the turret combined with a hull gun gave it a very tall profile . The United States 1st Armored Division also employed the M3 in Africa . It was a stopgap solution , never intended to be a design of major importance . In American and British service the M3 medium was phased out at the end of the North African campaign . It continued to serve in the Red Army for some time , and in a single campaign in the Pacific . Red Army crews nicknamed it `` grave for seven brothers '' referring to the seven - man crew .
