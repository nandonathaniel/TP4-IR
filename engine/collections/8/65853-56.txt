Portraits of Pushmataha ( left ) and Tecumseh . `` These white Americans ... give us fair exchange , their cloth , their guns , their tools , implements , and other things which the Choctaws need but do not make ... They doctored our sick ; they clothed our suffering ; they fed our hungry ... So in marked contrast with the experience of the Shawnees , it will be seen that the whites and Indians in this section are living on friendly and mutually beneficial terms . '' Pushmataha , 1811 -- Sharing Choctaw History . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - `` Where today are the Pequot ? Where are the Narragansett , the Mochican , the Pocanet , and other powerful tribes of our people ? They have vanished before the avarice and oppression of the white man , as snow before the summer sun ... Sleep not longer , O Choctaws and Chickasaws ... Will not the bones of our dead be plowed up , and their graves turned into plowed fields ? '' Tecumseh , 1811 -- The Portable North American Indian Reader .
