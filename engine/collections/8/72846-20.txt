Ipswich Town manager George Burley was the winner in 2000 -- 01 , the first time the award did not go to a league - winning manager . Ipswich Town , who won promotion to the Premier League from the First Division in the previous season , finished fifth and qualified for the UEFA Cup . Burley triumphed over Ferguson , who led Manchester United to their third consecutive championship title , and Liverpool manager Gérard Houllier , who guided his team to three trophies and a berth in the Champions League . Wenger was named the Manager of the Season for 2001 -- 02 after guiding Arsenal to thirteen consecutive wins towards the end of the season -- a run which ensured the club regained the Premier League trophy . For winning his eighth Premier League title with Manchester United , Ferguson was given the award in the 2002 -- 03 season . Wenger was the outstanding winner for the award in 2003 -- 04 as he managed Arsenal to an unprecedented achievement of winning the league without a single defeat . Reflecting on Wenger 's accomplishment , a Barclaycard Awards Panel spokesperson said `` Arsène Wenger is a very worthy recipient of this accolade and has sent his team into the history books . Arsenal have played exciting attacking football throughout the season and finishing it unbeaten is a feat that may not be repeated for another 100 years . ''
