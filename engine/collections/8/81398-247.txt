A number of narrative scenes from his life were often shown on the predella of altarpieces dedicated to John , and other settings , notably the large series in grisaille fresco in the Chiostro dello Scalzo ( it ) , which was Andrea del Sarto 's largest work , and the frescoed Life by Domenico Ghirlandaio in the Tornabuoni Chapel , both in Florence . There is another important fresco cycle by Filippo Lippi in Prato Cathedral . These include the typical scenes : the Annunciation to Zechariah , John 's birth , his naming by his father , the Visitation , John 's departure for the desert , his preaching in the desert , the Baptism of Christ , John before Herod , the dance of Salome , and his beheading .
