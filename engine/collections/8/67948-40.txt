In the Bulgarian language the most common use of portmanteau is as a part of advertising campaigns . One such example is the word gintuition ( джинтуиция pronounced dzhintuitsia ) , which is made up from the words gin and intuition . This one in particular is used , not surprisingly , as a part of a gin commercial . Another example is the word charomat , which consists of the words чар ( the Bulgarian word for charm ) and аромат ( meaning aroma ) , made popular by an ad about a coffee brand .
