Naval Captain William H. Stayton was a prominent figure in the anti-prohibition fight , founding the Association Against the Prohibition Amendment in 1918 . The AAPA was the largest of the nearly forty organizations that fought to end Prohibition . Economic urgency played a large part in accelerating the advocacy for repeal . The number of conservatives who pushed for prohibition in the beginning decreased . Many farmers who fought for prohibition now fought for repeal because of the negative effects it had on the agriculture business . Prior to the 1920 implementation of the Volstead Act , approximately 14 % of federal , state , and local tax revenues were derived from alcohol commerce . When the Great Depression hit and tax revenues plunged , the governments needed this revenue stream . Millions could be made by taxing beer . There was controversy on whether the repeal should be a state or nationwide decision . On March 22 , 1933 , President Franklin Roosevelt signed an amendment to the Volstead Act , known as the Cullen -- Harrison Act , allowing the manufacture and sale of 3.2 % beer ( 3.2 % alcohol by weight , approximately 4 % alcohol by volume ) and light wines . The Volstead Act previously defined an intoxicating beverage as one with greater than 0.5 % alcohol . Upon signing the Cullen -- Harrison Act , Roosevelt made his famous remark : `` I think this would be a good time for a beer . '' According to a 2017 study in the journal Public Choice , representatives from traditional beer - producing states , as well as Democratic politicians , were most in favor of the bill , but politicians from many Southern states were most strongly opposed to the legislation .
