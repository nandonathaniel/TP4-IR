Clothing is measured in inches , not centimeters . American shoes sizes are measured on different scales for children , men , and women but all sizes are derived from inches . Major multi-national apparel brands including Nike , Adidas , Hanes , and Levi s often sell the same inventory worldwide , with tags containing both SI and customary units in addition to laundry care symbols and instructions in many languages .
