In 1966 , Nintendo moved into the Japanese toy industry with the Ultra Hand , an extendable arm developed by its maintenance engineer Gunpei Yokoi in his free time . Yokoi was moved from maintenance to the new `` Nintendo Games '' department as a product developer . Nintendo continued to produce popular toys , including the Ultra Machine , Love Tester and the Kousenjuu series of light gun games . Despite some successful products , Nintendo struggled to meet the fast development and manufacturing turnaround required in the toy market , and fell behind the well - established companies such as Bandai and Tomy . In 1973 , its focus shifted to family entertainment venues with the Laser Clay Shooting System , using the same light gun technology used in Nintendo 's Kousenjuu series of toys , and set up in abandoned bowling alleys . Following some success , Nintendo developed several more light gun machines ( such as the light gun shooter game Wild Gunman ) for the emerging arcade scene . While the Laser Clay Shooting System ranges had to be shut down following excessive costs , Nintendo had found a new market .
