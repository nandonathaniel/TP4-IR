Arctic tundra contains areas of stark landscape and is frozen for much of the year . The soil there is frozen from 25 to 90 cm ( 10 to 35 in ) down , and it is impossible for trees to grow . Instead , bare and sometimes rocky land can only support low growing plants such as moss , heath ( Ericaceae varieties such as crowberry and black bearberry ) , and lichen . There are two main seasons , winter and summer , in the polar tundra areas . During the winter it is very cold and dark , with the average temperature around − 28 ° C ( − 18 ° F ) , sometimes dipping as low as − 50 ° C ( − 58 ° F ) . However , extreme cold temperatures on the tundra do not drop as low as those experienced in taiga areas further south ( for example , Russia 's and Canada 's lowest temperatures were recorded in locations south of the tree line ) . During the summer , temperatures rise somewhat , and the top layer of seasonally - frozen soil melts , leaving the ground very soggy . The tundra is covered in marshes , lakes , bogs and streams during the warm months . Generally daytime temperatures during the summer rise to about 12 ° C ( 54 ° F ) but can often drop to 3 ° C ( 37 ° F ) or even below freezing . Arctic tundras are sometimes the subject of habitat conservation programs . In Canada and Russia , many of these areas are protected through a national Biodiversity Action Plan .
