' Dance for You ' puts ( Beyoncé ) in the bedroom . Clocking in at over 6 minutes , the song of seduction plays as if it was being undressed , much like ( Beyoncé ) is , piece by piece , lyric for lyric . As with'Speechless ' and ' Cater 2 U ' , ( she ) often forgoes the independent woman anthems and beautiful power ballads to remind us that she is a real sexual being rather than a formulated sex symbol . It is breathy , but not boring . It does not chronicle innocent lovemaking with sugarcoated terms , but the grittier things that really go down when you are completely comfortable ( and overly confident ) with , as she puts it , the person ' you 'd like to thank , in case you do n't thank them enough ' .
