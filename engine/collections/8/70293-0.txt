The inauguration of the President of the United States is a ceremony to mark the commencement of a new four - year term of the President of the United States . This ceremony takes place for each new presidential term , even if the president is continuing in office for a second term . Since 1937 , it has taken place on January 20 , which is 72 to 78 days after the November presidential election ( on the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November ) . The term of a president commences at noon ( `` EST '' -- Eastern Standard Time ) on that day , when the Chief Justice of the United States administers the oath of office to the president . However , when January 20 falls on a Sunday , the chief justice administers the oath to the president on that day privately and then again in a public ceremony the next day , on Monday , January 21 . The most recent presidential inauguration ceremony was the swearing in of Donald Trump to a four - year term of office on Friday , January 20 , 2017 .
