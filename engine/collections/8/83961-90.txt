There is no federal law stating that a private business , a person , or an organization must accept currency or coins for payment . Private businesses are free to create their own policies on whether or not they accept cash , unless there is a specific state law which says otherwise . For example , a bus line may prohibit payment of fares in cents or dollar bills . In addition , movie theaters , convenience stores , and gas stations may refuse to accept large denomination currency as a matter of policy or safety .
