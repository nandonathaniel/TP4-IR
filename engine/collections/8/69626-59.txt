Vyvyan occasionally displays feats of superhuman strength and resilience , such as surviving a pickaxe through his head , moving entire walls with his bare hands , lifting Neil above his head in a fight with Rick , biting through a brick ( making the comment that some of the house 's bricks explode ) and even being decapitated and re-attaching his own head . He eats just about anything from televisions and dead rats to caviar and cornflakes with ketchup .
