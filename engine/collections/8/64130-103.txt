Curry is known for his elite shooting ability ; he is able to score in great volume from underneath the rim all the way to near half - court . He is considered by many to the greatest shooter in NBA history . Using an unorthodox jump shot , he is able to get the ball out of his hands in under half a second by releasing it on the way up , adding extra arc to his shot and making it difficult to block . In addition to his quick release , he puts extra pressure on defenses with his long range , leading the NBA in field goals made from beyond 28 feet in 2016 . As of April 2018 , he ranks fourth in NBA history in career three - point field goal percentage and holds four of the top five seasons in terms of total three - pointers made . He is also the fastest player in league history to make 2,000 career three - pointers , doing so in 227 fewer games than the previous record - holder . In an article for FiveThirtyEight , Benjamin Morris emphasized Curry 's importance in the NBA 's increasing use of the three - point shot , writing `` Curry is perhaps the figurehead in the NBA 's Three - Point Revolution .
