Due to warming air temperatures , ice - floe breakup in western Hudson Bay is currently occurring three weeks earlier than it did 30 years ago , reducing the duration of the polar bear feeding season . The body condition of polar bears has declined during this period ; the average weight of lone ( and likely pregnant ) female polar bears was approximately 290 kg ( 640 lb ) in 1980 and 230 kg ( 510 lb ) in 2004 . Between 1987 and 2004 , the Western Hudson Bay population declined by 22 % , although the population is currently listed as `` stable '' . As the climate change melts sea ice , the U.S. Geological Survey projects that two - thirds of polar bears will disappear by 2050
