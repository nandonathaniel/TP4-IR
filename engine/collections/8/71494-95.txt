Although English law insists that it is the responsibility of the prosecution to provide evidence proving a crime has been committed , an individual must provide evidence to prove that they had a `` good reason or lawful authority '' for carrying a knife ( if this is the case ) upon being detained . While this may appear to be a reversal of the usual burden of proof , technically the prosecution has already proven the case ( prima facie ) by establishing that a knife was being carried in a public place ( see Violent Crime Reduction Act 2006 on Knives , etc. ; New powers to tackle gun and knife crime )
