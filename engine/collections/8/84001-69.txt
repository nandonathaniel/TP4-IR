The 1975 Tour of the Americas kicked off in New York City with the band performing on a flatbed trailer being pulled down Broadway . The tour featured stage props including a giant phallus and a rope on which Jagger swung out over the audience . Jagger had booked live recording sessions at the El Mocambo club in Toronto to balance a long - overdue live album , 1977 's Love You Live ( UK 3 ; US 5 ) , the first Stones live album since Get Yer Ya - Ya 's Out ! .
