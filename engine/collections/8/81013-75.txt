In a single fight situation the linesmen will communicate with each other as to which player they will take during the fight , clear out any sticks , gloves , or other equipment that has been dropped and wait for a safe time to enter the fight , which they will do together . If both players are still standing while the linesmen enter , the linesmen will approach from each side ( never from behind ) , bring their arms over the combatants ' arms and wrap them around , pushing downwards and breaking the players apart . If the players have fallen , the linesmen will approach from the side ( never over the skates ) , getting in between the two players . One linesman will use his body to shield the player on the bottom from the other player while his partner will remove the top player from the fight . Most linesmen will allow a fight to run its course for their own safety , but will enter a fight regardless if one player has gained a significant advantage over his opponent . Once the players have been broken up , the linesmen then escort the players off the ice . During this time the referee will keep other players from entering the fight by sending them to a neutral area on the ice and then watching the fight and assessing any other penalties that occur .
