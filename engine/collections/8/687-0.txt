`` Cold turkey '' refers to the abrupt cessation of a substance dependence and the resulting unpleasant experience , as opposed to gradually easing the process through reduction over time or by using replacement medication . The term comes from the piloerection or `` goose bumps '' that occurs with abrupt withdrawal from opioids , which resembles the skin of a plucked refrigerated turkey .
