In 1989 , Graham was featured in Gus Van Sant 's Drugstore Cowboy as Nadine , a young drug - addicted accomplice of the two main characters ( played by Matt Dillon and Kelly Lynch ) . Her performance gave her career an initial boost and earned her a nomination for the Independent Spirit Award for Best Supporting Actress . She rejected a steady role in a soap opera and a three - picture deal with a major studio because she thought it would be too restrictive . After Drugstore Cowboy she appeared in Lawrence Kasdan 's dark comedy I Love You to Death ( 1990 ) , alongside William Hurt and Keanu Reeves and the rock - and - roll coming - of - age film Shout ( 1991 ) , for which she received a nomination for the Young Artist Award for Best Actress Starring in a Motion Picture .
