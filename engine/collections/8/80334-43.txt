Washington and Rochambeau discussed where to launch a joint attack . Washington believed an attack on New York was the best option , since the Americans and French now outnumbered the British defenders 3 to 1 . Rochambeau disagreed , arguing the fleet in the West Indies under Admiral de Grasse was going to sail to the American coast , where easier options than attacking New York could be attempted .
