Jeff Warschauer ( a cantor since 2015 ) started the Klezmer Conservatory Band ( 1990 - 2003 ) and is part of The Strauss / Warschauer Duo ( 1995 to present ) and has led Jewish mandolin orchestras Klez Camp and New York Arbeiter Ring . He has become a modern link to the older Jewish tradition , interviewing older Jewish musicians to collect songs in Yiddish and klesmer music . Coming from a background in Bluegrass , Swing , R&B and Folk music , he adapted his skills to use the mandolin in Klezmer , which does n't use mandolin as a traditional instrument In one example on his album The Singing Waltz , Warschauer mixed mandolin with trombones for the song Dem Helfand 's Tants ( The Elephant 's Dance ) , a combination that was also used for the Odessa Swing ( composed by Steve Netsky ) . He mixed accordian , drums and piano with mandolin on the song Ot Azoy ( That 's the Way ! ) .
