Even though the Chinese and North Koreans were exhausted by the war and were prepared to end it by late 1952 , Stalin insisted that they continue fighting , and the Armistice was approved only in July 1953 , after Stalin 's death . North Korean leader Kim Il Sung created a highly centralized , totalitarian dictatorship -- which continues to date -- according himself unlimited power and generating a formidable cult of personality . In the South , the American - backed strongman Syngman Rhee ran a significantly less brutal but deeply corrupt and authoritarian regime . After Rhee was overthrown in 1960 , South Korea fell within a year under a period of military rule that lasted until the re-establishment of a multi-party system in the late 1980s .
