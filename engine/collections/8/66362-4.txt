In the mid-late 1990s , many smartphone users carried a separate dedicated PDA device , running early versions of operating systems such as Palm OS , BlackBerry OS or Windows CE / Pocket PC . These operating systems would later evolve into mobile operating systems . In March 1996 , Hewlett - Packard released the OmniGo 700LX , a modified HP 200LX palmtop PC that supported a Nokia 2110 PDA with ROM - based software to support it . It had a 640 Ã— 200 resolution CGA compatible four - shade gray - scale LCD screen and could be used to place and receive calls , and to create and receive text messages , emails and faxes . It was also 100 % DOS 5.0 compatible , allowing it to run thousands of existing software titles , including early versions of Windows .
