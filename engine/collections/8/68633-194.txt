In the spring of 1921 , Banting traveled to Toronto to explain his idea to J.J.R. Macleod , Professor of Physiology at the University of Toronto , and asked Macleod if he could use his lab space to test the idea . Initially skeptical , Macleod eventually agreed and supplied Banting with ten test animals ( dogs ) and two medical students , Charles Best and Clark Noble , as lab assistants . Since Banting required only one lab assistant , Best and Noble flipped a coin to see which would assist Banting for the first half of the summer . Best won the coin toss and took the first shift . This may have proved unfortunate for Noble , Banting decided to keep Best for the entire summer and eventually shared half his Nobel Prize money and a large part of the credit for the discovery . Banting 's method was to tie a ligature around the pancreatic duct ; when examined several weeks later , the pancreatic digestive cells had died and been absorbed by the immune system , leaving thousands of islets . They then isolated an extract from these islets , producing what they called `` isletin '' ( what we now know as insulin ) , and tested this extract on the dogs starting July 27 . Banting and Best were then able to keep a pancreatectomized dog named Marjorie alive for the rest of the summer by injecting her with the crude extract they had prepared . Removal of the pancreas in test animals in essence mimics diabetes , leading to elevated blood glucose levels . Marjorie was able to remain alive because the extracts , containing isletin , were able to lower her blood glucose levels .
