Cherished by the Mandate of Heaven , the Great Mongol emperor sends this letter to the king of Japan . The sovereigns of small countries , sharing borders with each other , have for a long time been concerned to communicate with each other and become friendly . Especially since my ancestor governed at heaven 's command , innumerable countries from afar disputed our power and slighted our virtue . Goryeo rendered thanks for my ceasefire and for restoring their land and people when I ascended the throne . Our relation is feudatory like a father and son . We think you already know this . Goryeo is my eastern tributary . Japan was allied with Goryeo and sometimes with China since the founding of your country ; however , Japan has never dispatched ambassadors since my ascending the throne . We are afraid that the Kingdom is yet to know this . Hence we dispatched a mission with our letter particularly expressing our wishes . Enter into friendly relations with each other from now on . We think all countries belong to one family . How are we in the right , unless we comprehend this ? Nobody would wish to resort to arms .
