Gibbs is a habitual coffee drinker . When his coffee is spilled or someone else takes and / or drinks it without knowing ( this also translates to stolen food that is his ) , it almost always causes his temper to flare , and he will demand a new one ; at least once , however , he has done so simply to haze somebody , newcomer McGee . He even considers coffee the equivalent of breakfast , as seen when he was offered a selection of food from a diner , Abby asked him to at least have something before he left , and Gibbs merely grabbed the coffee cup .
