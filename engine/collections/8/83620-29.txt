If all 10 cards in a player 's hand fit into melds and thereby the player has no deadwood , he or she can choose to go Gin in which case the round ends and the player going Gin receives a Gin bonus of 25 points ( or another established amount ) plus any deadwood points in the opponent 's hand . The defending opponent can only lay out his or her melds and can not lay off any deadwood into the melds of an opponent that has declared Gin . A player can go Gin with a hand of three or fewer melds as long as all cards fit into a meld . Players can also have an 11 card gin , see Big Gin Variant below .
