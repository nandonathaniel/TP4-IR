In Wilkinson v. Austin , the Supreme Court held that , in addition to the due process right to meaningful review , prisoners also have a due process right to `` a statement of the reasons why they were placed or retained at the supermax '' so they can better understand how to behave in the future in order to be released from solitary confinement . Lobel argues that this `` implies that the officials must provide something more than a general statement that the prisoner is very dangerous '' . According to Lobel this is not what usually happens at supermax facilities , so the inmates ' due process rights are violated in this way as well .
