Although Yeltsin came to power on a wave of optimism , he never recovered his popularity after endorsing Yegor Gaidar 's `` shock therapy '' of ending Soviet - era price controls , drastic cuts in state spending , and an open foreign trade regime in early 1992 ( see Russian economic reform in the 1990s ) . The reforms immediately devastated the living standards of much of the population . In the 1990s Russia suffered an economic downturn that was , in some ways , more severe than the United States or Germany had undergone six decades earlier in the Great Depression . Hyperinflation hit the ruble , due to monetary overhang from the days of the planned economy .
