Mike Marqusee has written at length on the conflicts in Dylan 's life during this time , with its deepening alienation from his old folk - revival audience and clear - cut leftist causes . He suggests that the song is probably self - referential : `` The song only attains full poignancy when one realises it is sung , at least in part , to the singer himself : he 's the one ' with no direction home . ' '' Dylan himself has noted that , after his motorcycle accident in 1966 , he realized that `` when I used words like ' he ' and ' it ' and ' they , ' and talking about other people , I was really talking about nobody but me .
