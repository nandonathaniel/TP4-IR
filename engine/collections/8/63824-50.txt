On April 3 at WrestleMania XXVII , The Rock opened the show by cutting a promo . After appearing in numerous backstage segments , The Rock came to ringside to restart the main event between Cena and The Miz as a No Disqualification match , after it had ended in a draw . As revenge for the Attitude Adjustment Cena had given him on Raw , Rock hit Cena with the Rock Bottom , allowing The Miz to pin him and retain the WWE Championship . After the match , Rock attacked Miz and hit him with the People 's Elbow . The following night on Raw , Cena challenged The Rock to a match at WrestleMania XXVIII the next year , which Rock accepted . They then worked together to fend off an attack by The Corre , which at the time consisted of Wade Barrett , Heath Slater , Justin Gabriel , and Ezekiel Jackson . The Rock appeared live on Raw in his hometown of Miami to celebrate his 39th birthday .
