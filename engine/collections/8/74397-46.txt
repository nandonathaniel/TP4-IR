The dynamic range of metabolic rates in hummingbirds requires a parallel dynamic range in kidney function . During a day of nectar consumption with corresponding high water intake that may total five times the body weight per day , hummingbird kidneys process water via glomerular filtration rates ( GFR ) in amounts proportional to water consumption , thereby avoiding overhydration . During brief periods of water deprivation , however , such as in nighttime torpor , GFR ceases , preserving body water .
