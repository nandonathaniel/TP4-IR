`` Something '' was one of the rare Beatles songs that Elvis Presley chose to play , when he introduced it into the setlist for his third season at the International Hotel in Las Vegas , in August 1970 . He also performed it on his 1973 Aloha from Hawaii TV special , the recording from which appeared on the accompanying bestselling album . A live version from the 1970 Las Vegas concerts subsequently appeared on the Presley box sets Walk a Mile in My Shoes : The Essential ' 70s Masters ( 1995 ) and Live in Las Vegas ( 2001 ) . In 1974 , a recording by Johnny Rodriguez reached number 6 on Billboard 's Hot Country Singles chart and number 85 on the Hot 100 . In Canada , the song peaked at number 11 on the RPM country chart .
