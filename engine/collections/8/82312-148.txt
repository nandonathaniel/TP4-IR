Child labour has been a consistent struggle for children in Brazil ever since the country was colonised on April 22 , 1500 by Pedro √Ålvares Cabral . Work that many children took part in was not always visible , legal , or paid . Free or slave labour was a common occurrence for many youths and was a part of their everyday lives as they grew into adulthood . Yet due to there being no clear definition of how to classify what a child or youth is , there has been little historical documentation of child labour during the colonial period . Due to this lack of documentation , it is hard to determine just how many children were used for what kinds of work before the nineteenth century . The first documentation of child labour in Brazil occurred during the time of indigenous societies and slave labour where it was found that children were forcibly working on tasks that exceeded their emotional and physical limits . Armando Dias , for example , died in November 1913 whilst still very young , a victim of an electric shock when entering the textile industry where he worked . Boys and girls were victims of industrial accidents on a daily basis .
