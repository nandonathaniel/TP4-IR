In May 1930 , a petition was signed by 1,028 economists in the US asking President Hoover to veto the legislation , organized by Paul Douglas , Irving Fisher , James TFG Wood , Frank Graham , Ernest Patterson , Henry Seager , Frank Taussig , and Clair Wilcox . Automobile executive Henry Ford spent an evening at the White House trying to convince Hoover to veto the bill , calling it `` an economic stupidity . '' J.P. Morgan 's chief executive Thomas W. Lamont said he `` almost went down on ( his ) knees to beg Herbert Hoover to veto the asinine Hawley - Smoot tariff . ''
