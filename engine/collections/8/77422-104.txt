The Packers had a 9 -- 7 record in 1992 , and began to turn heads around the league when they signed perhaps the most prized free agent in NFL history in Reggie White on the defense in 1993 . White believed that Wolf , Holmgren , and Favre had the team heading in the right direction with a `` total commitment to winning . '' With White on board the Packers made it to the second round of the playoffs during both the 1993 and 1994 seasons but lost their 2nd - round matches to their playoff rival , the Dallas Cowboys , playing in Dallas on both occasions . In 1995 , the Packers won the NFC Central Division championship for the first time since 1972 . After a home playoff 37 -- 20 win against Favre 's former team , the Atlanta Falcons , the Packers defeated the defending Super Bowl champion San Francisco 49ers 27 -- 17 in San Francisco on the road to advance to the NFC Championship Game , where they lost again to the Dallas Cowboys 38 -- 27 .
