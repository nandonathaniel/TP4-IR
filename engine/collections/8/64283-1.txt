The term was coined in 1958 by Henry A. Landsberger , when analyzing earlier experiments from 1924 -- 32 at the Hawthorne Works ( a Western Electric factory outside Chicago ) . The Hawthorne Works had commissioned a study to see if their workers would become more productive in higher or lower levels of light . The workers ' productivity seemed to improve when changes were made , and slumped when the study ended . It was suggested that the productivity gain occurred as a result of the motivational effect on the workers of the interest being shown in them .
