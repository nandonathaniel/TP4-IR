Fidelity versus Sound - on - Film -- The fidelity of sound - on - film processes was improved considerably after the early work by Lee De Forest on his Phonofilm system and that of his former associate Theodore Case on what eventually became the Fox Movietone system , introduced in 1927 . The De Forest and Case - Fox systems used variable - density soundtracks , but the variable - area soundtrack used by RCA Photophone , introduced in 1928 , eventually predominated . Although the fidelity of optical sound never quite caught up with ongoing improvements in disc recording technology , for practical purposes the early quality advantage of discs had been overcome within a few years .
