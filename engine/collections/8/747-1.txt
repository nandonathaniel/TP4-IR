StarLink is a genetically modified maize , containing two modifications : a gene for resistance to glufosinate , and a variant of the bacillus thuringiensis ( Bt ) protein called Cry9C . Cry9C had not been used in a GM crop prior to StarLink , causing heightened regulatory scrutiny . StarLink 's creator , Plant Genetic Systems , which later became Aventis CropScience during the time of the incident , had applied to the US Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) to market StarLink for use in animal feed and in the human food supply . However , because the Cry9C protein lingers in the digestive system before breaking down , the EPA had concerns about its allergenicity , and PGS did not provide sufficient data to prove that Cry9C was not allergenic . As a result , PGS split its application into separate permits for use in food and use in animal feed only . StarLink was approved by the EPA for use in animal feed only in May 1998 . After the incident the company at first tried to get the application for human consumption approved , and then withdrew the product entirely from the market .
