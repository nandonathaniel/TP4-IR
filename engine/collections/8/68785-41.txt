Gram - positive bacteria possess a thick cell wall containing many layers of peptidoglycan and teichoic acids . In contrast , gram - negative bacteria have a relatively thin cell wall consisting of a few layers of peptidoglycan surrounded by a second lipid membrane containing lipopolysaccharides and lipoproteins . Lipopolysaccharides , also called endotoxins , are composed of polysaccharides and lipid A that is responsible for much of the toxicity of gram - negative bacteria . Most bacteria have the gram - negative cell wall , and only the Firmicutes and Actinobacteria have the alternative gram - positive arrangement . These two groups were previously known as the low G + C and high G + C gram - positive bacteria , respectively . These differences in structure can produce differences in antibiotic susceptibility ; for instance , vancomycin can kill only gram - positive bacteria and is ineffective against gram - negative pathogens , such as Haemophilus influenzae or Pseudomonas aeruginosa . If the bacterial cell wall is entirely removed , it is called a protoplast , whereas if it is partially removed , it is called a spheroplast . Î² - Lactam antibiotics , such as penicillin , inhibit the formation of peptidoglycan cross-links in the bacterial cell wall . The enzyme lysozyme , found in human tears , also digests the cell wall of bacteria and is the body 's main defence against eye infections .
