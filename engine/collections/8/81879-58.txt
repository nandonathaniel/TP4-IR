Ironically , the ABC affiliate in St. Louis , KDNL - TV , has been regarded as one of the network 's weakest affiliates since joining the network in 1995 . The previous ABC affiliate , KTVI , in contrast , was one of the strongest affiliates -- it had become a Fox station in 1995 , and thus , has televised the majority of the Rams ' games in this period .
