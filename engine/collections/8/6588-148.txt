As a busy shipping lane , the Channel experiences environmental problems following accidents involving ships with toxic cargo and oil spills . Indeed , over 40 % of the UK incidents threatening pollution occur in or very near the Channel . One of the recent occurrences was the MSC Napoli , which on 18 January 2007 was beached with nearly 1700 tonnes of dangerous cargo in Lyme Bay , a protected World Heritage Site coastline . The ship had been damaged and was en route to Portland Harbour .
