The primary source of rain in the Sahara is the Intertropical Convergence Zone , a continuous belt of low - pressure systems near the equator which bring the brief , short and irregular rainy season to the Sahel and southern Sahara . Rainfall in this giant desert has to overcome the physical and atmospheric barriers that normally prevent the production of precipitation . The harsh climate of the Sahara is characterized by : extremely low , unreliable , highly erratic rainfall ; extremely high sunshine duration values ; high temperatures year - round ; negligible rates of relative humidity ; a significant diurnal temperature variation ; and extremely high levels of potential evaporation which are the highest recorded worldwide .
