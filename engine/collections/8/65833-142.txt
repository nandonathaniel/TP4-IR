In the spirit of ecumenism more recent Catholic translations ( e.g. , the New American Bible , Jerusalem Bible , and ecumenical translations used by Catholics , such as the Revised Standard Version Catholic Edition ) use the same `` standardized '' ( King James Version ) spellings and names as Protestant Bibles ( e.g. , 1 Chronicles , as opposed to the Douaic 1 Paralipomenon , 1 - 2 Samuel and 1 - 2 Kings , instead of 1 - 4 Kings ) in those books universally considered canonical -- the protocanonicals .
