Junior varsity ( often called `` JV '' ) players are the members of a team who are not the main players in a competition ( such as any football , basketball , or baseball game ) , usually at the high school and college levels in the United States . The main players comprise the varsity team . Although the intensity of the JV team may vary from place to place , most junior varsity teams consist of players who are in their freshman and sophomore years in school , though occasionally upperclassmen may play on JV teams . For this reason , junior varsity teams are also often called freshman / sophomore teams . Especially skilled or physically mature freshmen and sophomores may compete at the varsity level . Some private school associations may permit very skilled seventh - or eighth - graders to compete on varsity teams . At larger schools , there may be two junior varsity teams for some sports , with a lower - level team typically consisting only of freshmen .
