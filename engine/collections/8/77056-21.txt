Merchants engaged in a multitude of private trades and industries . A single merchant often combined several trades to make greater profits , such as animal breeding , farming , manufacturing , trade , and money - lending . Some of the most profitable commodities sold during the Han were salt and iron , since a wealthy salt or iron distributor could own properties worth as much as ten million cash . In the early Western Han period , powerful merchants could muster a workforce of over a thousand peasants to work in salt mines and marshes to evaporate brine to make salt , or at ironworks sites where they operated bellows and casted iron implements . To curb the influence of such wealthy industrialists , Emperor Wu nationalized these industries by 117 BCE and for the first time drafted former merchants with technical know - how such as Sang Hongyang ( d . 80 BCE ) to head these government monopolies . However , by the Eastern Han period the central government abolished the state monopolies on salt and iron . Even before this , the state must have halted its employment of former merchants in the government salt and iron agencies , since an edict of 7 BCE restated the ban on merchants entering the bureaucracy . However , the usurper Wang Mang ( r . 9 -- 23 CE ) did employ some merchants as low - level officials with a salary - rank of 600 bushels . Another profitable industry was brewing wine and liquor , which the state briefly monopolized from 98 to 81 BCE , yet relinquished its production to private merchants once again ( with alcohol taxes reinstalled ) . The official Cui Shi ( 催 寔 ) ( d . 170 CE ) started a brewery business to help pay for his father 's costly funeral , an act which was heavily criticized by his fellow gentrymen who considered this sideline occupation a shameful one for any scholar . Cinnabar mining was also a very lucrative industry .
