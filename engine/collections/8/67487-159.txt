The Bill met heavy resistance in the House of Lords , as Roman Catholic bishops as well as the lay peers voted against it . They reworked much of the Bill , changed the litany to allow for a transubstantial belief in the Communion and refused to grant Elizabeth the title of Supreme Head of the Church . Parliament was prorogued over Easter , and when it resumed , the government entered two new bills into the Houses -- the Act of Supremacy and the Act of Uniformity .
