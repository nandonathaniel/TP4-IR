Currently , Fortnite provides two distinct modes : a player - versus - environment `` Save the World '' , and a player - versus - player `` Battle Royale '' . The latter mode was added after Fortnite 's initial early access launch , and later offered as a separate free - to - play mode on September 26 , 2017 , that does not require the base game to play .
