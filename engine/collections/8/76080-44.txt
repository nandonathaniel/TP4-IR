Today in Italy , the title is usually only given to Roman Catholic diocesan priests ( never for prelates , who bear higher honorifics such as monsignore , eminenza , and so on ) . In Sardinia , until recently it was commonly used for nobility ( whether titled or not ) , but it is being presently used mainly when the speaker wants to show that he or she knows the don 's condition of nobility .
