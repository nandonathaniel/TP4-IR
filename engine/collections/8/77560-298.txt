Phillies fans are known for harsh criticism of their own stars such the 1964 Rookie of the Year Richie Allen and Hall of Fame third baseman Mike Schmidt . The fans , however , are just as well known for heckling the visiting team . Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Burt Hooton 's poor performance during game three of the 1977 NLCS has often been attributed to the crowd 's taunting . J.D. Drew , the Phillies ' first overall draft pick in the amateur draft of 1997 , never signed with the Phillies following a contract dispute with the team , instead re-entering the draft the next year to be drafted by the St. Louis Cardinals . Phillies fans were angered over this disrespect and hurled debris , including two D batteries , at Drew during an August 1999 game . Subsequent visits by Drew to Philadelphia continue to be met with sustained booing from the Phillies fans .
