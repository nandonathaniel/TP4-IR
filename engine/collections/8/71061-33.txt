Estimates of the effectiveness of the United Kingdom 's call and recall system vary widely , but it may prevent about 700 deaths per year in the UK . A medical practitioner performing 200 tests each year would prevent a death once in 38 years , while seeing 152 people with abnormal results , referring 79 for investigation , obtaining 53 abnormal biopsy results , and seeing 17 persisting abnormalities lasting longer than two years . At least one woman during the 38 years would die from cervical cancer despite being screened .
