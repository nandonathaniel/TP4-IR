At that time , the Giants were approached by San Francisco mayor George Christopher . Despite objections from shareholders such as Joan Whitney Payson , majority owner Horace Stoneham entered into negotiations with San Francisco officials around the same time the Dodgers ' owner Walter O'Malley was courting the city of Los Angeles . O'Malley had been told that the Dodgers could not move to Los Angeles unless a second team moved to California . He pushed Stoneham toward relocation , and so in the summer of 1957 both the New York Giants and Brooklyn Dodgers announced their moves to California , ending the three - team golden age of baseball in New York City .
