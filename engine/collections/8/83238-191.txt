Former Norwegian prime minister Kjell Magne Bondevik has criticized IKEA for not depicting women assembling furniture in its instruction booklets . IKEA denied this claim in a statement . A researcher from the University of Copenhagen pointed out that for years , IKEA has named their cheap rugs after Danish places , while the more expensive and luxurious furniture was named after Swedish places . The researcher , Klaus Kj√∏ller , who is well known for tongue - in - cheek statements , accused IKEA of cultural imperialism . In October 2012 , IKEA was criticized for airbrushing women out of pictures in catalogues which were used in Saudi Arabia . In October 2017 , a TV commercial by IKEA showing a mother scolding her daughter for not `` bringing home a boyfriend '' was criticized by netizens for `` sexist '' and discrimination against singles and single women in China . IKEA then apologized for `` giving the wrong perception '' .
