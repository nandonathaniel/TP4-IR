As noted above , the Supreme Court indicated in Prigg v. Pennsylvania , 41 U.S. 539 ( 1842 ) , that the states can not be compelled to use state law enforcement resources to enforce federal law . The Supreme Court reaffirmed this principle in cases such as Printz v. United States , 521 U.S. 898 ( 1997 ) and New York v. United States , 505 U.S. 144 ( 1992 ) , which held that the federal government may not enact a regulatory program that `` commandeers '' the state 's legislative and administrative mechanisms to enforce federal law . States therefore may refuse to use their legislative or administrative resources to enforce federal law . This should be distinguished from nullification . States that withhold their enforcement assistance , but do not declare the federal law unconstitutional or forbid its enforcement by the federal government , are not declaring federal law invalid and therefore are not engaging in nullification . As Prigg held , the federal law still is valid and federal authorities may enforce it within the state . The states in this situation , rather than attempting to legally nullify federal law , are attempting to make enforcement of federal law more difficult by refusing to make available their legislative and administrative resources .
