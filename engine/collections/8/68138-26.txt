In the 1970s , the Hawaiian seafloor was mapped using ship - based sonar . Computed SYNBAPS ( Synthetic Bathymetric Profiling System ) data filled holes between the ship - based sonar bathymetric measurements . From 1994 to 1998 the Japan Agency for Marine - Earth Science and Technology ( JAMSTEC ) mapped Hawaii in detail and studied its ocean floor , making it one of the world 's best - studied marine features . The JAMSTEC project , a collaboration with USGS and other agencies , utilized manned submersibles , remotely operated underwater vehicles , dredge samples , and core samples . The Simrad EM300 multibeam side - scanning sonar system collected bathymetry and backscatter data .
