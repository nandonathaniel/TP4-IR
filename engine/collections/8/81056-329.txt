They swore oaths of loyalty , `` solemn declarations of patriotic allegiance , ( and ) affirmations of the political responsibilities of citizenship .

Throughout the Revolution , other women such as Pauline LÃ©on and her Society of Revolutionary Republican Women supported the radical Jacobins , staged demonstrations in the National Assembly and participated in the riots , often using armed force .
