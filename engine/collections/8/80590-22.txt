More recently inducer exclusion was shown to block expression of the lac operon when glucose is present . Glucose is transported into the cell by the PEP - dependent phosphotransferase system . The phosphate group of phosphoenolpyruvate is transferred via a phosphorylation cascade consisting of the general PTS ( phosphotransferase system ) proteins HPr and EIA and the glucose - specific PTS proteins EIIA and EIIB , the cytoplasmic domain of the EII glucose transporter . Transport of glucose is accompanied by its phosphorylation by EIIB , draining the phosphate group from the other PTS proteins , including EIIA . The unphosphorylated form of EIIA binds to the lac permease and prevents it from bringing lactose into the cell . Therefore , if both glucose and lactose are present , the transport of glucose blocks the transport of the inducer of the lac operon .
