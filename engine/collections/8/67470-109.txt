Buddhism saw a surge during the reign of Mongols following the invasion of Genghis Khan and the establishment of the Il Khanate and the Chagatai Khanate who brought their Buddhist influence with them during the 13th century ; however , within 100 years the Mongols who remained in that region would convert to Islam and spread Islam across all the regions of central Asia . Only the eastern Mongols and the Mongols of the Yuan dynasty would keep Vajrayāna Buddhism .
