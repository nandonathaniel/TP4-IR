In an attempt to provide a clear assessment of the theory that a purely physical facial change , involving only certain facial muscles , can result in an emotion , Strack , Martin , & Stepper ( 1988 ) devised a cover story that would ensure the participants adopt the desired facial posing without being able to perceive either the corresponding emotion or the researchers ' real motive . Told they were taking part in a study to determine the difficulty for people without the use of their hands or arms to accomplish certain tasks , participants held a pen in their mouth in one of two ways . The Lip position would contract the orbicularis oris muscle , resulting in a frown . The Teeth position would cause the zygomaticus major or the risorius muscle , resulting in a smile . The control group would hold the pen in their nondominant hand . All had to fill a questionnaire in that position and rate the difficulty involved . The last task , which was the real objective of the test , was the subjective rating of the funniness of a cartoon . The test differed from previous methods in that there were no emotional states to emulate , dissimulate or exaggerate .
