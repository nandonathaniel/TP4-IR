O Angel of Christ , my holy Guardian and Protector of my soul and body , forgive me all my sins of today . Deliver me from all the wiles of the enemy , that I may not anger my God by any sin . Pray for me , sinful and unworthy servant , that thou mayest present me worthy of the kindness and mercy of the All - holy Trinity and the Mother of my Lord Jesus Christ , and of all the Saints . Amen .
