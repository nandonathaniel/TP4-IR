Sexual transmission is possible through vaginal , anal , or oral sex . Sexual transmission may be prevented through the use of barrier protection . Perinatal transmission may occur during childbirth , and may be prevented by antibiotic treatment of the mother before birth and the application of antibiotic eye gel on the eyes of the newborn . After an episode of gonococcal infection , infected persons do not develop immunity to future infections . Reinfection is possible due to N. gonorrhoeae 's ability to evade the immune system by varying its surface proteins .
