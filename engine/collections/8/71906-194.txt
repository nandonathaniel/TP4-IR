The Nintendo 3DS XL was very well received at launch . Reviewers generally recommended the console to new buyers of the Nintendo 3DS family , although not so much to current owners of a Nintendo 3DS . Kotaku mentioned it as `` possibly the best portable gaming device ever ... ( and ) a well - designed machine ... '' and that `` it plays great games '' while The Verge called it `` the best portable gaming buy around right now . '' The Nintendo 3DS XL improves upon the battery life of the original 3DS . Kotaku claimed that the Nintendo 3DS XL 's battery `` lasts a cross-country flight . '' . Sam Byford of The Verge noted that the larger top screen makes more obvious problems with aliasing and low - resolution textures . He did , however , say that the 3D felt more immersive : `` Where the 3DS felt like peering through a peephole into another world , the XL is almost like stepping through a door . '' On the other hand , Destructoid said the 3D effect on the XL was more subtle than on its predecessor . The Verge spoke positively of the build quality and design choices , saying the console improved on the original . A Destructoid reviewer said the 3DS XL was easier to use than the regular Nintendo 3DS , mainly due to his large hands . The Verge noted lowered sound quality from the original , the result of smaller speakers . Both The Verge and Gizmodo complained of low - quality cameras .
