The original producers thought that a 1939 audience was too sophisticated to accept Oz as a straight - ahead fantasy ; therefore , it was reconceived as a lengthy , elaborate dream sequence . Because of a perceived need to attract a youthful audience through appealing to modern fads and styles , the score had featured a song called `` The Jitterbug '' , and the script had featured a scene with a series of musical contests . A spoiled , selfish princess in Oz had outlawed all forms of music except classical and operetta , and went up against Dorothy in a singing contest in which her swing style enchanted listeners and won the grand prize . This part was initially written for Betty Jaynes . The plan was later dropped .
