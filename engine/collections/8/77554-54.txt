Dave 's - In late 2011 , Wendy 's altered the recipe for their Single , Double , and Triple burgers , which had been staples of the menu for decades , in order to rerelease each as part of the new Dave 's Hot ' N Juicy line . As before , they were constructed from the same basic patty ( and the words `` Single , '' `` Double , '' and `` Triple '' were retained at the end of the new names ) , but the patty was now thicker , and its square edges had been rounded off slightly . The cheese began to be stored at a warmer temperature , allowing it to melt more completely over the patty , alterations were made to the bun and the selection of produce ( white onions were replaced by red onions ) , and the condiments now consisted of ketchup and mayonnaise rather than ketchup , mayonnaise , and mustard . They were updated in 2016 and renamed as simply Dave 's , now using bakery - style buns .
