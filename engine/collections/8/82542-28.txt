Transpiration rates of plants can be measured by a number of techniques , including potometers , lysimeters , porometers , photosynthesis systems and thermometric sap flow sensors . Isotope measurements indicate transpiration is the larger component of evapotranspiration . Recent evidence from a global study of water stable isotopes shows that transpired water is isotopically different from groundwater and streams . This suggests that soil water is not as well mixed as widely assumed .
