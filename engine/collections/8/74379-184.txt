The Hall of African Peoples is located behind Akeley Hall of African Mammals and underneath Sanford Hall of North American Birds . It is organized by the four major ecosystems found in Africa : River Valley , Grasslands , Forest - Woodland , and Desert . Each section presents artifacts and exhibits of the peoples native to the ecosystems throughout Africa . The hall contains three dioramas and notable exhibits include a large collection of spiritual costumes on display in the Forest - Woodland section .
