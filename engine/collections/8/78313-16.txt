Eliot sent the manuscript drafts of the poem to John Quinn in October 1922 ; they reached Quinn in New York in January 1923 . Upon Quinn 's death they were inherited by his sister , Julia Anderson . Years later , in the early 1950s , Mrs Anderson 's daughter , Mary Conroy , found the documents in storage . In 1958 she sold them privately to the New York Public Library .
