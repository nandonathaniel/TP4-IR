Up until the 1970s , popular rock musicians began writing and producing in English . In the early 1970s , rock music began to be written using local languages , with bands like the Juan Dela Cruz Band being among the first popular bands to do so . Mixing Tagalog and English lyrics were also popularly used within the same song , in songs like `` Ang Miss Universe Ng Buhay Ko '' ( `` The Miss Universe of My Life '' ) by the band Hotdog which helped innovate the Manila Sound . The mixing of the two languages ( known as `` Taglish '' ) , while common in casual speech in the Philippines , was seen as a bold move , but the success of Taglish in popular songs , including Sharon Cuneta 's first hit , `` Mr. DJ '' , broke the barrier forevermore .
