A small amount of an appropriate solvent ( eluent ) is poured into a glass beaker or any other suitable transparent container ( separation chamber ) to a depth of less than 1 centimeter . A strip of filter paper ( aka `` wick '' ) is put into the chamber so that its bottom touches the solvent and the paper lies on the chamber wall and reaches almost to the top of the container . The container is closed with a cover glass or any other lid and is left for a few minutes to let the solvent vapors ascend the filter paper and saturate the air in the chamber . ( Failure to saturate the chamber will result in poor separation and non-reproducible results ) .
