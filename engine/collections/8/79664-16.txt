After a stint of working in the US , Duffy returned to England and signed a deal as a solo artist with Virgin 10 . Now working under the name Stephen `` Tin Tin '' Duffy ( which was frequently mocked by Radio 1 DJs as Stephen `` Duff Duff '' Tinny ) , he recorded a new version of `` Kiss Me '' which was released in 1984 , this time only in the local West Midlands area , followed by a nationwide release of `` She Makes Me Quiver '' which peaked at no. 88 in September 1984 . At the end of 1984 , Duffy recorded a third version of `` Kiss Me '' , produced by J.J. Jeczalik and Nicholas Froome , which was released in February 1985 . It debuted at no . 22 and peaked at no . 4 in the UK Singles Chart and staying in the UK Top 10 for five weeks altogether . Duffy followed this with the single `` Icing on the Cake '' , which peaked at no. 14 in June 1985 .
