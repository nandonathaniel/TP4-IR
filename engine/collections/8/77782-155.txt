In week one of the finals series the Warriors were thrashed 40 -- 10 by the Brisbane Broncos . Other results went the Warriors way and they were fortunate to progress to week two of the finals where they would meet a high flying Wests Tigers who had completed their 9th straight victory . The match was expected to go the Tigers way however a brilliant second half comeback by the Warriors culminated in a late and controversial try to Krisnan Inu which saw the Warriors win 22 -- 20 and earn the right to play the Melbourne Storm for a place in the Grand Final .
