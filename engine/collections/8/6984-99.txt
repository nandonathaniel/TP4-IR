In November 2016 , Louise Mensch reported on the news website Heat Street that , after an initial June 2016 FBI request was denied , the FISA court had granted a more narrowly - focused October request from the FBI `` to examine the activities of ' U.S. persons ' in Donald Trump 's campaign with ties to Russia '' . On 12 January 2017 , BBC journalist Paul Wood reported that , in response to an April 2016 tip from a foreign intelligence agency to the CIA about `` money from the Kremlin going into the US presidential campaign '' , a joint taskforce had been established including representatives of the FBI , the Department of the Treasury , the Department of Justice , the CIA , the Office of the Director of National Intelligence and the National Security Agency ; and in June 2016 lawyers from the Department of Justice had applied to the FISA court for `` permission to intercept the electronic records from two Russian banks '' . According to Wood , this application was rejected , as was a more narrowly focussed request in July , and the order was finally granted by a different FISA judge on 15 October , three weeks before the presidential election . On January 19 the New York Times reported that one of its sources had claimed `` intelligence reports based on some of the wiretapped communications had been provided to the White House '' .
