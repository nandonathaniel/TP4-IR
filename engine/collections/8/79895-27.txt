In 2004 , Backe shuffled between Triple - A and the majors , pitching out of the bullpen when he was with the Astros . On August 21 , Backe was called up for his first major league start , where he ended up limiting the Chicago Cubs to four hits and no runs over seven innings . After that start , Backe became a permanent member of the Astros rotation , going 4 - 2 over the final two months of the season .
