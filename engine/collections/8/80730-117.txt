The factory system centralized production in separate buildings funded and directed by specialists ( as opposed to work at home ) . The division of labor made both unskilled and skilled labor more productive , and led to a rapid growth of population in industrial centers . The shift away from agriculture toward industry had occurred in Britain by the 1730s , when the percentage of the working population engaged in agriculture fell below 50 % , a development that would only happen elsewhere ( the Low Countries ) in the 1830s and ' 40s . By 1890 , the figure had fallen to under 10 % percent and the vast majority of the British population was urbanized . This milestone was reached by the Low Countries and the US in the 1950s .
