In 1833 , Carl Friedrich Gauss , together with the physics professor Wilhelm Weber in GÃ¶ttingen installed a 1,200 - metre - long ( 3,900 ft ) wire above the town 's roofs . Gauss combined the Poggendorff - Schweigger multiplicator with his magnetometer to build a more sensitive device , the galvanometer . To change the direction of the electric current , he constructed a commutator of his own . As a result , he was able to make the distant needle move in the direction set by the commutator on the other end of the line .
