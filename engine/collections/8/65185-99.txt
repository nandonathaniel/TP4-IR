The scene following the attack on Pearl Harbor , where President Roosevelt demands an immediate retaliatory strike on the soil of Japan , did not happen as portrayed in the film . Admiral Chester Nimitz and General George Marshall are seen denying the possibility of an aerial attack on Japan , but in real life they actually advocated such a strike . Another inconsistency in this scene is when President Roosevelt ( who was at this time in his life , stricken and bound to a wheelchair due to Polio ) is able to stand up to challenge his staff 's distrust in a strike on Japan . This too , never happened in real life . In the film Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto says `` I fear all we have done is to awaken a sleeping giant '' , a quote which was copied from the 1970 film Tora ! Tora ! Tora ! .
