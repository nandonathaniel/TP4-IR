The Host Club finds out that one of their regular customers , Kanako Kasugazaki , is having trouble with her fianc√© , Toru Suzushima , who is planning to leave to study abroad . The group cooks up a plan to help them reunite at an upcoming Dance . As part of the club 's plan , they make Haruhi dress as a girl to approach Toru pretending to be an admirer . Toru tells her that he 's flattered but that he cares for someone else . Kanako finds them together and flees , in tears . Toru catches up to her and they reaffirm their feelings for one another . At the end of the party , a `` queen '' is chosen to receive a kiss on the cheek from Tamaki . However , just as Kanako is chosen as the queen , the twins Hikaru and Kaoru Hitachiin announce that Haruhi will be giving the kiss . Tamaki , realizing this will be Haruhi 's first kiss , runs to stop her and accidentally pushes her , so that instead of a kiss on the cheek Haruhi kisses Kanako on the lips , embarrassing them both . Despite this the evening is a success with Kanako and Toru back together .
