The governing body of rugby union in England , the Rugby Football Union ( RFU ) , long resisted leagues as it was believed that the introduction of leagues would increase ' dirty ' play and put pressure on clubs to pay their players ( thereby contravening the amateur ethos ) . Instead , clubs arranged their own friendlies and had traditional games . The only organised tournaments were the County Cups and County Championship -- the former played by clubs and the latter by County representative teams . The Daily Telegraph and a few local newspapers -- such as the Yorkshire Post -- compiled ' pennants ' based on teams ' performances , but as the strength of fixture lists varied , it was at best an estimate of a team 's performance throughout a season .
