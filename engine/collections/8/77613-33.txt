Hold ' em is normally played using small and big blind bets -- forced bets by two players . Antes ( forced contributions by all players ) may be used in addition to blinds , particularly in later stages of tournament play . A dealer button is used to represent the player in the dealer position ; the dealer button rotates clockwise after each hand , changing the position of the dealer and blinds . The small blind is posted by the player to the left of the dealer and is usually equal to half of the big blind . The big blind , posted by the player to the left of the small blind , is equal to the minimum bet . In tournament poker , the blind / ante structure periodically increases as the tournament progresses . After one round of betting is done , the next betting round will start by the person in the small blind .
