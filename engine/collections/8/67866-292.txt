St. Isidore Church was built between 1620 and 1664 by order of Empress Maria of Austria , daughter of Charles V of Germany and I of Spain , to become part of a school run by the Jesuits , which still exists today . Its dome is the first example of a dome drawing on a wooden frame covered with plaster , which , given its lightness , makes it easy to support the walls . It was the cathedral of Madrid between 1885 and 1993 , which is the time it took to build the Almudena . The artworks inside were mostly burned during the Spanish Civil War , but it retained the tomb that holds the incorrupt body of Saint Isidore Laborer and the urn containing the ashes of his wife , Maria Torribia .
