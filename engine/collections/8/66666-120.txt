Even though Bolívar condemned the corrupt practices of the Spanish , he ordered the plundering of cities while in Peru , with some churches being stripped of their decorations . On March 19 , 1824 , José Gabriel Pérez wrote to Antonio José de Sucre about the orders given to him by Bolívar ; Pérez talked about `` all the ordinary and extraordinary means '' that should be applied to assure the subsistence of the patriot army . Indeed , Pérez said that Bolívar issued instructions to take from churches `` all golden and silver jewels '' in order to coin them and pay war expenditures . Days later , Bolívar himself said to Sucre that there would be a complete lack of resources , unless severe actions would be taken against `` the jewels of the churches , everywhere '' .
