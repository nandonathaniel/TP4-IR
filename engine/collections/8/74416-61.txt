For most of the 20th century , when it came into existence , Northern Ireland was marked by discrimination and hostility between these two sides in what First Minister of Northern Ireland David Trimble called a `` cold house '' for Catholics . In the late 1960s , conflict between state forces and chiefly Protestant unionists on the one hand , and chiefly Catholic nationalists on the other , erupted into three decades of violence known as the Troubles , which claimed over 3,500 lives and caused over 50,000 casualties . The 1998 Good Friday Agreement was a major step in the peace process , including the decommissioning of weapons , although sectarianism and religious segregation still remain major social problems , and sporadic violence has continued .
