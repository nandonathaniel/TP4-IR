Shortly after the 2016 Orlando nightclub shooting , a CBS News poll found that a majority of Americans ( 57 % ) supported a ban on assault weapons . Gallup noted a similarly high percentage of Americans thought that a ban would be an effective response to terrorism after the 2015 San Bernardino shooting ( 55 % ) , and in 2013 when the question was put in a referendum format ( `` Would you vote for or against a law that would reinstate and strengthen the ban on assault weapons that was in place from 1994 to 2004 ? '' ) ( 56 % support ) . But it noted that `` Support for stricter gun control laws often rises after high - profile shooting incidents and then often subsides again , '' and that support for stricter gun controls , although still a majority view , had declined since the early 1990s . By October 2016 , support for an assault weapons ban had fallen to a historical low of 36 % .
