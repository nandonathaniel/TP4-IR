Training for Special Constables is delivered locally at seven locations throughout Scotland over a series of evenings and / or weekends . The training is split into two parts , with the first phase being delivered in a classroom environment before being sworn in as a Special Constable and the second phase is delivered after being sworn in . Upon successful completion of both parts of the training programme Special Constables are awarded a certificate of achievement and would be eligible to complete an abbreviated course at the Scottish Police College should they later wish to join the Police Service of Scotland as a regular officer .
