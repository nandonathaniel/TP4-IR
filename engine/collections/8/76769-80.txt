On 30 May 1498 , Columbus left with six ships from Sanl√∫car , Spain , for his third trip to the New World . Three of the ships headed directly for Hispaniola with much - needed supplies , while Columbus took the other three in an exploration of what might lie to the south of the Caribbean islands he had already visited , including a hoped - for passage to continental Asia .
