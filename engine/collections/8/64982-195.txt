In October 2007 , just prior to the calling of a federal election , the then Prime Minister , John Howard , revisited the idea of bringing a referendum to seek recognition of Indigenous Australians in the Constitution ( his government first sought to include recognition of Aboriginal peoples in the Preamble to the Constitution in a 1999 referendum ) . His 2007 announcement was seen by some as a surprising adoption of the importance of the symbolic aspects of the reconciliation process , and reaction was mixed . The ALP initially supported the idea , however Kevin Rudd withdrew this support just prior to the election -- earning stern rebuke from activist Noel Pearson . Critical sections of the Australian public and media meanwhile suggested that Howard 's raising of the issue was a `` cynical '' attempt in the lead - up to an election to `` whitewash '' his handling of this issue during his term in office . David Ross of the Central Land Council was sceptical , saying `` it 's a new skin for an old snake '' , while former Chairman of the Reconciliation Council Patrick Dodson gave qualified support , saying : `` I think it 's a positive contribution to the process of national reconciliation ... It 's obviously got to be well discussed and considered and weighed , and it 's got to be about meaningful and proper negotiations that can lead to the achievement of constitutional reconciliation . '' The Gillard Government , with bi-partisan support , convened an expert panel to consider changes to the Australian Constitution that would see recognition for Indigenous Australians . The Government promised to hold a referendum on the constitutional recognition of indigenous Australians on or before the federal election due for 2013 . The plan was abandoned in September 2012 , with Minister Jenny Macklin citing insufficient community awareness for the decision .
