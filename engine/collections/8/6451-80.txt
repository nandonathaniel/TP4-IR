Two contrasting viewpoints on time divide prominent philosophers . One view is that time is part of the fundamental structure of the universe -- a dimension independent of events , in which events occur in sequence . Isaac Newton subscribed to this realist view , and hence it is sometimes referred to as Newtonian time . The opposing view is that time does not refer to any kind of `` container '' that events and objects `` move through '' , nor to any entity that `` flows '' , but that it is instead part of a fundamental intellectual structure ( together with space and number ) within which humans sequence and compare events . This second view , in the tradition of Gottfried Leibniz and Immanuel Kant , holds that time is neither an event nor a thing , and thus is not itself measurable nor can it be travelled .
