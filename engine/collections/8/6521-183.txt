Beginning with Intel Kaby Lake and AMD Bristol Ridge , Windows 10 is the only version of Windows that Microsoft will officially support on newer CPU microarchitectures . Terry Myerson stated that Microsoft did not want to make further investments in optimizing older versions of Windows and associated software for newer generations of processors . These policies were criticized by the media , who especially noted that Microsoft was refusing to support newer hardware ( particularly Intel 's Skylake CPUs , which was also originally targeted by the new policy with a premature end of support that was ultimately retracted ) on Windows 8.1 , a version of Windows that is still in mainstream support until January 2018 . In addition , an enthusiast - created modification was released that disabled the check and allowed Windows 8.1 and earlier to continue to work on the platform .
