Today , the practice of casting secret ballots is so commonplace that most voters would not consider that any other method might be used . Other methods which had been used and which are still used in some places and contexts include `` oral votes '' as well as Open ballot systems involving the public display of votes or roll calls . Other public voting methods include raising a hand to indicate a vote , or the use of coloured marbles or cards to indicate a voting choice .
