Recent advances in the identification of the tethers between the mitochondrial and ER membranes suggest that the scaffolding function of the molecular elements involved is secondary to other , non-structural functions . In yeast , ERMES , a multiprotein complex of interacting ER - and mitochondrial - resident membrane proteins , is required for lipid transfer at the MAM and exemplifies this principle . One of its components , for example , is also a constituent of the protein complex required for insertion of transmembrane beta - barrel proteins into the lipid bilayer . However , a homologue of the ERMES complex has not yet been identified in mammalian cells . Other proteins implicated in scaffolding likewise have functions independent of structural tethering at the MAM ; for example , ER - resident and mitochondrial - resident mitofusins form heterocomplexes that regulate the number of inter-organelle contact sites , although mitofusins were first identified for their role in fission and fusion events between individual mitochondria . Glucose - related protein 75 ( grp75 ) is another dual - function protein . In addition to the matrix pool of grp75 , a portion serves as a chaperone that physically links the mitochondrial and ER Ca channels VDAC and IP3R for efficient Ca transmission at the MAM . Another potential tether is Sigma - 1R , a non-opioid receptor whose stabilization of ER - resident IP3R may preserve communication at the MAM during the metabolic stress response .
