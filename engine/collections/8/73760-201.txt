It may be possible for other parts of the Solar System to be inhabited by humanity at some point in the future . Geoffrey Landis of NASA 's Glenn Research Center in particular has pointed out that `` ( at ) cloud - top level , Venus is the paradise planet '' , as one could construct aerostat habitats and floating cities there easily , based on the concept that breathable air is a lifting gas in the dense Venusian atmosphere . Venus would , like also Saturn , Uranus , and Neptune , in the upper layers of their atmospheres , even afford a gravitation almost exactly as strong as that on Earth ( see colonization of Venus ) .
