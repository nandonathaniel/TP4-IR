At the time of its completion , the Post Office Building contained the largest uninterrupted enclosed space in the city . Its clock tower reached 315 feet ( 96 m ) into the air . It was also the city 's first building to have a steel frame structure , and the first to be built with electrical wiring incorporated into its design . The structure featured elevators with cages of highly intricate wrought iron , a glass covered atrium and mezzanine level , and floors , moldings , railings , and wainscoting made of marble . The atrium was 196 feet ( 60 m ) high , and 10 floors of balconies looked out onto the space ( which provided interior light in an era when indoor lighting was not common ) . It boasted more than 39,000 interior electric lights , and its own electrical generator . Girders and catwalks spanned the atrium at the third floor level to allow post office supervisors to look down on the workers . The fifth floor housed executive offices in the corners . Each office had a turret , ornately carved wooden moldings , and red oak paneling . But there were problems with the structure . The Washington Star newspaper reported that the skylights and windows leaked air and water , the marble floors were poorly laid , and much of the construction was shoddy . The ninth floor was to have served as a file room , but a post-construction inspection showed it could not accommodate the weight . Technological advances in electricity and electrical wiring , mechanical engineering , movement of air , heating , and more made the building out of date as soon as it opened .
