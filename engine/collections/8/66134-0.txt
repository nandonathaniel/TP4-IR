In chemistry , a radical ( more precisely , a free radical ) is an atom , molecule , or ion that has an unpaired valence electron . With some exceptions , these unpaired electrons make free radicals highly chemically reactive towards other substances , or even towards themselves : their molecules will often spontaneously dimerize or polymerize if they come in contact with each other . Most radicals are reasonably stable only at very low concentrations in inert media or in a vacuum .
