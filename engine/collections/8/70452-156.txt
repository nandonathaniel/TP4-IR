The White Court had , in 1918 , struck down an attempt by Congress to regulate child labor in Hammer v. Dagenhart . Congress thereafter attempted to end child labor by imposing a tax on certain corporations making use of it . That law was overturned by the Supreme Court in 1922 in Bailey v. Drexel Furniture Co. , with Taft writing the court 's opinion for an 8 -- 1 majority . He held that the tax was not intended to raise revenue , but rather was an attempt to regulate matters reserved to the states under the Tenth Amendment , and that allowing such taxation would eliminate the power of the states . One case in which Taft and his court upheld federal regulation was Stafford v. Wallace . Taft ruled for a 7 -- 1 majority that the processing of animals in stockyards was so closely tied to interstate commerce as to bring it within the ambit of Congress 's power to regulate .
