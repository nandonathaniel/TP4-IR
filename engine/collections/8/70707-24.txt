Yeats was close to Lady Gregory and her home place of Coole Park , Co , Galway . He would often visit and stay there as it was a central meeting place for people who supported the resurgence of Irish literature and cultural traditions . His poem , `` The Wild Swans at Coole '' was written there , between 1916 and 1917 .
