The film differs from its source material in a number of ways . While the novel serves as a memory - piece from Elio 's perspective , the filmmakers behind Call Me by Your Name chose to set the movie entirely in the present timeline , a `` much more efficient '' solution , to help the audience understand the characters and `` reflect the essence of the book . '' The setting was changed from Bordighera to the countryside of Crema , Lombardy , where Guadagnino lives . He decided to push up the original setting from 1987 to 1983 -- which he explained was a year , `` in Italy at least , when everything that was great about the ' 70s is definitely shut down '' , and one in which the characters `` are in a way untouched by the corruption of the ' 80s -- in the U.S. , Reagan , and in the UK , Thatcher '' . Mr. Perlman 's profession was refined by Ivory from a classics scholar to `` an art historian / archeologist type . ''
