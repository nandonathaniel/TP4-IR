Many tax systems prescribe longer depreciable lives for buildings and land improvements . Such lives may vary by type of use . Many such systems , including the United States and Canada , permit depreciation for real property using only the straight line method , or a small fixed percentage of cost . Generally , no depreciation tax deduction is allowed for bare land . In the United States , residential rental buildings are depreciable over a 27.5 year or 40 year life , other buildings over a 39 or 40 year life , and land improvements over a 15 or 20 year life , all using the straight line method .
