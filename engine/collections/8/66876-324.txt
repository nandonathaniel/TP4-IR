Ethnic tensions had escalated between the Armenians and Azerbaijanis in spring and summer 1988 . On January 9 , 1990 , after the Armenian parliament voted to include Nagorno - Karabakh within its budget , renewed fighting broke out , hostages were taken , and four Soviet soldiers were killed . On January 11 , Popular Front radicals stormed party buildings and effectively overthrew the communist powers in the southern town of Lenkoran . Gorbachev resolved to regain control of Azerbaijan ; the events that ensued are known as `` Black January . '' Late on January 19 , 1990 , after blowing up the central television station and cutting the phone and radio lines , 26,000 Soviet troops entered the Azerbaijani capital Baku , smashing barricades , attacking protesters , and firing into crowds . On that night and during subsequent confrontations ( which lasted until February ) , more than 130 people died . Most of these were civilians . More than 700 civilians were wounded , hundreds were detained , but only a few were actually tried for alleged criminal offenses .
