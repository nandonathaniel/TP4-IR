The Vigil Honor is a recognition given to Arrowmen for distinguished contributions beyond the immediate responsibilities of their position or office to their lodge , the Order of the Arrow , Scouting , or their Scout Camp . The Vigil Honor may be conferred upon Arrowmen who have completed a minimum of two years as a Brotherhood member and have performed exceptional service above and beyond their immediate responsibilities through leadership , exemplary efforts , and dedication . However , under no circumstances should tenure in Scouting or the Order of the Arrow be considered as reason enough for a Vigil Honor recommendation . Selection is annual and is limited to one person for every 50 members of the lodge , and members of the Order can be inducted into the Vigil Honor only with the written approval of the National Order of the Arrow Committee .
