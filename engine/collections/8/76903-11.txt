The Christian holiday of Pentecost , which is celebrated on the fiftieth day after Easter , commemorates the descent of the Holy Spirit upon the Apostles and other followers of Jesus Christ while they were in Jerusalem celebrating the Feast of Weeks , as described in the Acts of the Apostles ( Acts 2 : 1 -- 31 ) . Christians believe this event represents the birth of the Church .
