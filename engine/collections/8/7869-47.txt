The priority households will have monthly public distribution system ( PDS ) entitlement of 35 kg rice , wheat flour , pulses , gram and iodised salt at subsidised price . `` The new act will make the acclaimed PDS more comprehensive . Nearly 90 % of the provisions incorporated in the Act were already covered under the PDS '' , the chief minister Raman Singh said. The new initiative will put a burden of Rs. 2311 crore on the state exchequer . The act will not cover those who are income tax payees , own over 4 hectares of irrigated or 8 hectares of non-irrigated land in non-scheduled areas and who are liable to pay property tax in urban areas .
