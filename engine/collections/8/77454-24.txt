Vehicle Pull -- Vehicles such as transport trucks , trams , boxcars , buses , or planes are pulled across a 100 - foot ( 30 m ) course as fast as possible . One variation sees the competitors pull the object with a rope toward them . Another has them attached to a rope which is attached to a vehicle , while they use another rope to pull themselves down the course . A third involves no ropes , with the competitors pulling the vehicle while connected to a harness . The 2007 competition featured pulling a fire truck ( possibly a nod to 2006 champion Phil Pfister , a professional firefighter ) , and the 2008 qualifying rounds featured a coal truck ( a reference to the coal mining industry in West Virginia , where the competition was held ) .
