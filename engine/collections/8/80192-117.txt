After the defeat of France in the Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars ( 1792 -- 1815 ) , the UK emerged as the principal naval and imperial power of the 19th century ( with London the largest city in the world from about 1830 ) . Unchallenged at sea , British dominance was later described as Pax Britannica ( `` British Peace '' ) , a period of relative peace in Europe and the world ( 1815 -- 1914 ) . By the time of the Great Exhibition of 1851 , Britain was described as the `` workshop of the world '' . Using the imperial tools of free trade and financial investment , it exerted major influence on many countries outside Europe and the empire , especially in Latin America and Asia . Thus Britain had both a formal Empire based on British rule as well as an informal one based on the British pound .
