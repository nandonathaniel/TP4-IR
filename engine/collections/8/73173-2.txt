The word ion comes from the Greek word ἰόν , ion , `` going '' , the present participle of ἰέναι , ienai , `` to go '' . This term was introduced by English physicist and chemist Michael Faraday in 1834 for the then - unknown species that goes from one electrode to the other through an aqueous medium . Faraday did not know the nature of these species , but he knew that since metals dissolved into and entered a solution at one electrode and new metal came forth from a solution at the other electrode ; that some kind of substance has moved through the solution in a current . This conveys matter from one place to the other .
