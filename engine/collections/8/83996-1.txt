Aqueducts moved water through gravity alone , usually along a slight overall downward gradient within conduits of stone , brick , or concrete , but sometimes through steeper gradients . Most conduits were buried beneath the ground and followed the contours of the terrain ; obstructing peaks were circumvented or , less often , tunneled through . Where valleys or lowlands intervened , the conduit was carried on bridgework , or its contents fed into high - pressure lead , ceramic , or stone pipes and siphoned across . Most aqueduct systems included sedimentation tanks , which helped reduce any water - borne debris . Sluices and castella aquae ( distribution tanks ) regulated the supply to individual destinations . The run - off water from aqueducts sometimes drove urban water - mills , and scoured the drains and sewers .
