The Ford Explorer Sport was a 3 - door version of the Ford Explorer , designed to take the place of the Bronco II in Ford 's model line , and was produced from 1991 to 2003 . The Sport began as a trim level of the Ford Explorer , but it eventually became its own model . It rode on a 10 '' shorter wheelbase . There was only one Sport , but there were several other trim levels of the Explorer that were available with 2 - doors , such as the XL ( 1991 -- 1997 ) , the Eddie Bauer ( 1991 -- 1994 ) , and the Expedition ( 1995 ) . In 1998 the Explorer Sport became the only 3 - door trim level of the Explorer , and in 2001 it became its own model , as the second generation Explorer moved on to a 5 - door - only 3rd generation . Production ceased in July 2003 .
