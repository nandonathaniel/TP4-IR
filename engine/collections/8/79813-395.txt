A car used by a driver if he has damaged his main car . It may or may not have the same setup as the primary car . Now banned in Formula One for cost - cutting reasons , though teams in many other major racing series have a spare car available at the track . At Indianapolis , it is traditionally called a `` T Car '' ( `` T '' loosely short for `` training '' )
