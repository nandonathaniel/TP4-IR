In November 2006 , the Golden Gate Bridge , Highway and Transportation District recommended a corporate sponsorship program for the bridge to address its operating deficit , projected at $80 million over five years . The District promised that the proposal , which it called a `` partnership program , '' would not include changing the name of the bridge or placing advertising on the bridge itself . In October 2007 , the Board unanimously voted to discontinue the proposal and seek additional revenue through other means , most likely a toll increase .
