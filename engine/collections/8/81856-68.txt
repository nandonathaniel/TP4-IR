The technology specifications of the iPhone SE are similar to the iPhone 6S . This meant that at its launch , the iPhone SE was more powerful than the existing iPhone 6 despite the SE debuting as the entry - level offering while the 6 was the midrange offering in the lineup , which was rectified in September 2016 when the 6 was discontinued and its midrange slot given over to the 6S .
