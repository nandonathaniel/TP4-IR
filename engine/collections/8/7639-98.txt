James entered the NBA as an 18 - year - old rookie and made an immediate offensive impact when he led the Cavaliers in scoring . He holds numerous `` youngest to '' distinctions , including being the youngest player to score 28,000 career points . During his first stint in Cleveland , he was primarily used as an on - ball point forward . His shooting tendencies were perimeter - oriented , and he established himself as one of the best slashers and finishers in basketball ; he led the NBA in three - point plays in 2006 . His combination of speed , quickness , and size often created matchup problems for opposing teams because he was capable of blowing by larger defenders and overpowering smaller ones . These qualities became more apparent in transition , where he developed a reputation for grabbing defensive rebounds and then beating the defense downcourt for highlight - quality baskets . Around this time , James was frequently criticized for not having developed a reliable jump shot or post game . Teams would try to exploit these weaknesses by giving him space in the half court and forcing him to settle for three - pointers and long two - pointers , a strategy famously utilized by Spurs coach Greg Popovich in the 2007 Finals , where James converted on only 36 percent of his field goals in four games .
