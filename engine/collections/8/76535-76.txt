In the final , Argentina played West Germany , coached by former player Franz Beckenbauer . Caniggia was suspended for one game after receiving a yellow card in the match against Italy so he could not play the final . Germany arrived to the final as a wide favorite to take the Cup , as the squad had showed an effective and precise playing style , unlike Argentina which ( with the exception of the game with Italy ) had not had good previous performances . In addition , German footballers were in good condition while the Argentine players came to the final with several injuries , including Maradona . The game proved to be violent , brutal and bad tempered , particularly from the Argentines . Nevertheless , Germany only could score a goal at 83 minutes for a doubtful punishment by Mexican referee Edgardo Codesal , who awarded Germany a penalty kick for what he thought was a foul by Roberto Sensini against Rudi VÃ¶ller . The call was controversial , and it was heavily debated by the Argentinian players . Andreas Brehme converted the penalty kick to give West Germany team its third World Cup title .
