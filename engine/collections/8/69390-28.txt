The first phase of neoclassicism in France is expressed in the Louis Quinze style of architect Ange - Jacques Gabriel ( Petit Trianon , 1762 -- 68 ) ; the second phase , in the styles called Directoire and `` Empire '' , might be characterized by Jean Chalgrin 's severe astylar Arc de Triomphe ( designed in 1806 ) . In England the two phases might be characterized first by the structures of Robert Adam , the second by those of Sir John Soane . The interior style in France was initially a Parisian style , the `` Go√ªt grec '' ( `` Greek style '' ) not a court style . Only when the young king acceded to the throne in 1774 did Marie Antoinette , his fashion - loving Queen , bring the Louis XVI style to court .
