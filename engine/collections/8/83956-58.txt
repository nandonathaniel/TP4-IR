Mineralocorticoid secretion is regulated mainly by the renin -- angiotensin -- aldosterone system ( RAAS ) , the concentration of potassium , and to a lesser extent the concentration of ACTH . Sensors of blood pressure in the juxtaglomerular apparatus of the kidneys release the enzyme renin into the blood , which starts a cascade of reactions that lead to formation of angiotensin II . Angiotensin receptors in cells of the zona glomerulosa recognize the substance , and upon binding they stimulate the release of aldosterone .
