Not long after the Mexican reinforcements arrived , Houston ordered Smith to destroy Vince 's Bridge , 5 miles ( 8.0 km ) away , to slow down any further Mexican reinforcements . At 4 p.m. the Texians began creeping quietly through the tall grass , pulling the cannon behind them . The Texian cannon fired at 4 : 30 , beginning the battle of San Jacinto . After a single volley , Texians broke ranks and swarmed over the Mexican breastworks to engage in hand - to - hand combat . Mexican soldiers were taken completely by surprise . Santa Anna , Castrill√≥n , and Almonte yelled often conflicting orders , attempting to organize their men into some form of defense . Within 18 minutes , Mexican soldiers abandoned their campsite and fled for their lives . The killing lasted for hours .
