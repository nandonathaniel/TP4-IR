December 16 , 1811 , sometimes termed the `` Dawn Shock '' or `` Daylight Shock '' , 1315 UTC ( 7 : 15 a.m. ) ; ( M ~ 7 ) epicenter in northeast Arkansas . January 23 , 1812 , 1515 UTC ( 9 : 15 a.m. ) ; ( M ~ 7.3 ) epicenter around New Madrid , although this is disputed . This was probably the smallest of the three main shocks , but resulted in widespread ground deformation , landslides , fissuring , and stream bank caving in the meizoseismal area . Johnston and Schweig attributed this earthquake to a rupture on the New Madrid North Fault . A minority viewpoint holds that this earthquake 's epicenter was in southern Illinois . A 2011 expert panel urged further research to clarify this point , stating that the Illinois hypothesis would mean that an extended section of fault exists , perhaps still loaded and capable of hosting a great earthquake in the future . February 7 , 1812 , 0945 UTC ( 3 : 45 a.m. ) ; ( M ~ 7.5 ) epicenter near New Madrid , Missouri . This was the largest event in the series , and it destroyed the town of New Madrid . At St. Louis , Missouri , many houses were severely damaged , and their chimneys were toppled . It appears to have occurred on Reelfoot fault , a reverse fault segment that crosses under the Mississippi River just south of Kentucky Bend and continues to the east as the Lake County Uplift . In this event , uplift along the fault created temporary waterfalls on the Mississippi River , created a wave that propagated upstream , and caused the formation of Reelfoot Lake by damming streams .
