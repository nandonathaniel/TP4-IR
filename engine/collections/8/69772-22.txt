Barcode labels A large proportion of labels produced today carry barcodes , either for product identification , for traceability in items such as freight packages , and on items requiring brand authentication and protection . There are many different formats of barcodes found on labels , but one of the most commonly distributed formats is the International Article Number ( EAN ) . This is the code used to identify retail products worldwide , and is found on almost all consumer level packaging labels .
