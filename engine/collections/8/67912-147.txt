These traditions are probably rooted in Christian Ascension Day 's processions to the farmlands , which has been celebrated since the 18th century . Men would be seated in a wooden cart and carried to the village 's plaza , and the mayor would award a prize to the father who had the most children , usually a big piece of ham . In the late 19th century the religious component was progressively lost , especially in urban areas such as Berlin , and groups of men organized walking excursions with beer and ham . By the 20th century , alcohol consumption had become a major part of the tradition . Many people will take the following Friday off at work , and some schools are closed on that Friday as well ; many people then use the resulting four - day - long weekend for a short vacation .
