Reviewing the first seven episodes , Brian Lowry of Variety said , the season begins `` on an uneven note '' , comparing some of the early moments to the works of Sam Peckinpah , `` complete with slow - motion bullets and blood sprays . Stick with it , though , and the show blossoms , featuring a few terrific action sequences while introducing into this grim world seminal characters the Punisher and Elektra . '' Kevin Fitzpatrick of Screen Crush felt the first seven episodes of the season seemed `` to have learned the best of both '' from season one and Jessica Jones , `` placing its most compelling imagery front and center straightaway , but still taking time to pick apart the characters beneath them , rather than shout platitudes about saving the city . '' He also praised the castings of Bernthal and Yung as Punisher and Elektra , respectively , and enjoyed `` the improved spotlight '' for Foggy and Karen , given the reduction of Dawson saying , `` So many superhero series struggle to draw its supporting characters as compellingly as the action , and Daredevil 's particular blend of set piece and legal thriller feels inescapably original . '' However , Fitzpatrick did note the series lacked the presence Vondie Curtis - Hall brought as Ben Urich in the first season . He concluded that the season 's progression `` feels much cleaner '' than the first 's , `` moving almost in acts more than back and forth victories ... Even the aim feels that much more cohesive , to start in a place of Matt , Foggy and Karen all confident in their new roles , but wrestling with the consequence of their choice to always help the helpless . '' Merrill Barr of Forbes said , `` Daredevil season two is very much the same excellent show Daredevil season one was ... but in the places it is n't , it 's also very much improved '' . Barr praised Bernthal as the Punisher , and noted the reduction in the amount of `` thick blacks '' in the cinematography that the first season was criticized for .
