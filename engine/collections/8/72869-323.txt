In November 2005 , the World Summit on the Information Society , held in Tunis , called for an Internet Governance Forum ( IGF ) to be convened by United Nations Secretary General . The IGF opened an ongoing , non-binding conversation among stakeholders representing governments , the private sector , civil society , and the technical and academic communities about the future of Internet governance . The first IGF meeting was held in October / November 2006 with follow up meetings annually thereafter . Since WSIS , the term `` Internet governance '' has been broadened beyond narrow technical concerns to include a wider range of Internet - related policy issues .
