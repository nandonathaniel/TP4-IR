The Cubs and Dodgers are tied at seven apiece for most World Series losses between World Series victories . The Dodgers lost their first seven appearances in the Fall Classics ( 1916 , 1920 , 1941 , 1947 , 1949 , 1952 , and 1953 ) before winning their first title in 1955 . The Cubs ' situation was the opposite : between winning their last two titles ( in 1908 and 2016 ) , they lost the World Series in 1910 , 1918 , 1929 , 1932 , 1935 , 1938 , and 1945 . The Cleveland Indians have four World Series losses ( 1954 , 1995 , 1997 , and 2016 ) since their last crown in 1948 , more than any other team in the American League .
