The first formal athletic league involving eventual Ivy League schools ( or any US colleges , for that matter ) was created in 1870 with the formation of the Rowing Association of American Colleges . The RAAC hosted a de facto national championship in rowing during the period 1870 -- 1894 . In 1895 , Cornell , Columbia , and Penn founded the Intercollegiate Rowing Association , which remains the oldest collegiate athletic organizing body in the US . To this day , the IRA Championship Regatta determines the national champion in rowing and all of the Ivies are regularly invited to compete .
