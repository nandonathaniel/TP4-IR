Michigan v. Jackson , 475 U.S. 625 ( 1986 ) If a police interrogation begins after a defendant asserts his or her right to counsel at an arraignment or similar proceeding , then any waiver of that right for that police - initiated interrogation is invalid ( overruled by Montejo v. Louisiana ( 2009 ) ) .
