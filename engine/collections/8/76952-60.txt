After the disappointing result against Manchester United , Arsenal went on a spending spree on the last day of the transfer window , purchasing Per Mertesacker , Mikel Arteta , Andr√© Santos and Yossi Benayoun . Results began to improve , with a win over newly promoted Swansea City , before a Champions League away draw against Borussia Dortmund . Winning in the League Cup against Shrewsbury Town , in the Premier League against Bolton and in the Champions League against Olympiacos boosted morale around the club , and Arsenal began climbing the league table , after spending a time in the bottom quarter of the table .
