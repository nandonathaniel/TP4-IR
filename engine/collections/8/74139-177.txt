In Spain , a republic had been set up following the abdication of the king . After a series of elections , a coalition of republicans , socialists , Marxists , and anticlericals were brought to power . The army , joined by Spanish Conservatives rose up against the republic . In 1939 the Spanish Civil War ended , and General Francisco Franco became dictator . Franco supported the governments of Italy and Germany , although he was not as strongly committed to Fascism as they were and instead focused more on restoring traditionalism and Catholicism to dominance in Spain .
