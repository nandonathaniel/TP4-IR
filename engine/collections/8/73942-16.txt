The 2002 re-alignment changed the entire look of the NFC West . The Falcons , Panthers , and Saints moved into the NFC South ; while the Cardinals , the only team not from the Pacific Time Zone since 2016 ( Mountain ) and the Seahawks , moved in . The Rams remained in the West , preserving the historical rivalry with the 49ers that has existed since 1950 , and thus had been the only team in the division that was located in the western half of the Rocky Mountains and from the Central Time Zone from 1995 to 2015 during their St. Louis years . With the Rams ' return to Los Angeles in 2016 , the entire NFC West is located West of the Rockies for the first time in NFL history ( and is the only division in the whole NFL to have that distinction ) .
