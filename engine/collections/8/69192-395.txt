In addition to the features in common with HDMI ( such as HDCP encrypted uncompressed high - definition video and eight - channel surround sound ) , MHL also adds the provision of power charging for the mobile device while in use , and also enables the TV remote to control it . Although support for these additional features requires connection to an MHL - enabled HDMI port , power charging can also be provided when using active MHL to HDMI adapters ( connected to standard HDMI ports ) , provided there is a separate power connection to the adapter .
