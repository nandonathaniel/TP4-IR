John Locke stated that whenever labour is mixed with natural resources , such as is the case with improved land , private property is justified under the proviso that there must be enough other natural resources of the same quality available to others . Geoists state that the Lockean proviso is violated wherever land value is greater than zero . Therefore , under the assumed principle of equal rights of all people to natural resources , the occupier of any such land must compensate the rest of society to the amount of that value . For this reason , geoists generally believe that such payment can not be regarded as a true ' tax ' , but rather a compensation or fee . This means that while Geoists also regard taxation as an instrument of social justice , contrary to social democrats and social liberals they do not regard it as an instrument of redistribution but rather a ' predistribution ' or simply a correct distribution of the commons .
