Industrialization , immigration and urbanization in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries have also created new socioeconomic regional communities in France , both urban ( like Paris , Lyon , Villeurbanne , Lille , Marseille , etc . ) and the suburban and working class hinterlands ( like Seine - Saint - Denis ) of urban agglomerations ( called variously banlieues ( `` suburbs '' , sometimes qualified as `` chic '' or `` pauvres '' or les cit√©s `` housing projects '' ) ) which have developed their own `` sense of place '' and local culture ( much like the various boroughs of New York City or suburbs of Los Angeles ) , as well as cultural identity .
