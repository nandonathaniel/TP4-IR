For Darwin and his contemporaries , natural selection was in essence synonymous with evolution by natural selection . After the publication of On the Origin of Species , educated people generally accepted that evolution had occurred in some form . However , natural selection remained controversial as a mechanism , partly because it was perceived to be too weak to explain the range of observed characteristics of living organisms , and partly because even supporters of evolution balked at its `` unguided '' and non-progressive nature , a response that has been characterised as the single most significant impediment to the idea 's acceptance . However , some thinkers enthusiastically embraced natural selection ; after reading Darwin , Herbert Spencer introduced the phrase survival of the fittest , which became a popular summary of the theory . The fifth edition of On the Origin of Species published in 1869 included Spencer 's phrase as an alternative to natural selection , with credit given : `` But the expression often used by Mr. Herbert Spencer of the Survival of the Fittest is more accurate , and is sometimes equally convenient . '' Although the phrase is still often used by non-biologists , modern biologists avoid it because it is tautological if `` fittest '' is read to mean `` functionally superior '' and is applied to individuals rather than considered as an averaged quantity over populations .
