Political parties were not well organised or disciplined in the 17th century . They were more like factions with `` members '' drifting in and out , collaborating temporarily on issues when it was to their advantage , then disbanding when it was not . A major deterrent to the development of opposing parties was the idea that there could only be one `` King 's Party '' and to oppose it would be disloyal or even treasonous . This idea lingered throughout the 18th century . Nevertheless it became possible at the end of the 17th century to identify Parliaments and Ministries as being either `` Whig '' or `` Tory '' in composition .
