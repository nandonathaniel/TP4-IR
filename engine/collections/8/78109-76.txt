In May 1992 , Michael R. Rampino published an abstract for the American Geophysical Union noting the discovery of a circular gravity anomaly near the Falkland Islands . He suggested this structure might correspond to an impact crater with a diameter of 250 km ( 160 mi ) . In August 2017 , Rampino , Maximilliano Rocca and Jaime Baez Presser followed up with a paper providing further seismic and magnetic evidence that the structure is an impact crater . Estimates for the age of the structure range up to 250 millions years old . If , in fact , this is an impact crater , it would be substantially larger than the well - known 180 km ( 110 mi ) Chicxulub impact crater associated with a later extinction event .
