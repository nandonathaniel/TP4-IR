For all ESA selected astronauts , Basic Training begins at the EAC headquarters . This section of the training cycle has four separate training blocks that last 16 months . Astronauts will receive an orientation on the major spacefaring nations , their space agencies , and all major manned and unmanned space programs . Training in this phase also looks into applicable laws and policies of the space sector . Technical ( including engineering , astrodynamics , propulsion , orbital mechanics , etc . ) and scientific ( including human physiology , biology , earth observation , and astronomy ) basics are introduced , to ensure that all new astronauts have the required base level of knowledge . Training is done on ISS operations and facilities , including an introduction to all major operating systems on board the ISS that are required for its functionality as a manned space research laboratory . This phase also covers in - depth systems operations for all spacecraft that service the ISS ( e.g. Soyuz , Progress , Automatic Transfer Vehicle ( ATV ) , and the H - II Transfer Vehicle ( HTV ) ) , as well as ground control and launch facility training . This training phase also focuses on skills such as robotic operations , rendezvous and docking , Russian language courses , human behavior and performance , and finally a PADI open water scuba diving course . This scuba course provides basic EVA training at ESA 's NBF before moving onto the larger NASA training facility at the Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center .
