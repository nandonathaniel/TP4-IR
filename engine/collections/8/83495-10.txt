Mowing with a scythe is a skilled task made to look easy by experienced mowers but needs time to learn the skill . Long - bladed traditional scythes , typically around 90 centimetres ( 35 in ) ( such as in the example below ) and suitable for mowing grass or wheat are harder to use at first , consequently , beginners usually start on shorter blades , say 70 centimetres ( 28 in ) or less . Common beginner 's errors include : setting up the snaith with the handles in the wrong locations to suit the body , setting the blade at the wrong turn - in and turn - up angles to suit the conditions , choosing a blade that is too long for the skill level , failing to start with a sharp edge and persevering with a dull one during use , chopping or hacking at the grass , trying to cut too wide a strip of grass at once and striking the ground with the blade . Traditionally , beginners relied on mentors to help them set up and maintain their scythe and to teach them to mow comfortably and efficiently .
