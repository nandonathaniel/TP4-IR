The $100 million opening announced for Transformers : Age of Extinction is disputed within the industry . According to Rentrak -- which has a direct line into the vast majority of theatres in the United States and Canada to track actual ticket sales -- about 4,100 of the 4,233 theatres playing the film generated $95.9 million . The projected total from the Rentrak sales data would put the opening three - day weekend gross at around $97.5 million . For Transformers to have crossed the $100 million threshold , it would have needed to gross more than the nationwide average in the theatres not tracked by Rentrak . Some media outlets have elected to go with the Rentrak figure .
