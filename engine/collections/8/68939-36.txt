There are three founding sires that all Thoroughbreds can trace back to in the male line : the Darley Arabian , the Godolphin Arabian , and the Byerly Turk , named after their respective owners Thomas Darley , Lord Godolphin , and Captain Robert Byerly . They were taken to England , where they were mated with mares from English and imported bloodlines . The resultant foals were the first generation of Thoroughbreds , and all modern Thoroughbreds trace back to them . Thoroughbreds range in height , which is measured in hands ( a hand being four inches ) . Some are as small as 15 hands while others are over 17 . Thoroughbreds can travel medium distances at fast paces , requiring a balance between speed and endurance . Thoroughbreds may be bay , black , dark bay / brown , chestnut , gray , roan , white or palomino . Artificial insemination , cloning and embryo transfer are not allowed in the Thoroughbred breed .
