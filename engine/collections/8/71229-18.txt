Hostilities with Germany and Italy ended in May 1945 , and with Japan in August . Alien enemies , and U.S. citizens , continued to be interned . On July 14 , 1945 , President Harry S. Truman issued Presidential Proclamation 2655 , titled `` Removal of Alien Enemies '' . The proclamation gave the Attorney General authority regarding aliens enemies within the continental United States , to decide whether they are `` dangerous to the public peace and safety of the United States '' , to order them removed , and to create regulations governing their removal . The proclamation cited the revised Alien Enemies Act ( 50 U.S.C. 21 -- 24 ) as to powers of the President to make public proclamation regarding `` subjects of the hostile nation '' more than fourteen years old and living inside the United States but not naturalized , to remove them as alien enemies , and to determine the means of removal .
