Snow in the state of Louisiana presents a rare and serious problem because of the state 's subtropical climate . For snow to push into the southern region of Louisiana , extreme weather conditions for the area must be present , usually a low - pressure system coupled with unusually low temperatures . Average snowfall in Louisiana is approximately 0.2 inches ( 5.1 mm ) per year , a low figure rivaled only by the states of Florida and Hawaii . Due to the infrequency of these cold weather patterns , southern areas affected in this state are often unprepared to deal with slick streets and freezing temperatures .
