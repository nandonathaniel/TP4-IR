On Prince Wu 's character , DiMartino said , `` Despite Prince Wu 's obnoxiousness and arrogance , he 's a good guy underneath . We wrote him to be goofy and to annoy Mako , but when he has his breakdown on the fake throne in the restaurant in episode three , he showed his vulnerable side , and his character gained some more depth . It 's always fun to write for characters like this , who do n't have any social filters and say and do whatever they like . '' Prince Wu was designed by character designer Christie Tseng and Konietzko . The character 's design went through a lot of versions during the concept stage . According to Konietzko , Wu seemed `` too cool '' in most of them , while Konietzko wanted him to be `` more feeble , with less of a chiseled jawline . '' On Wu 's final design , Konietzko noted he was `` particularly happy with his fabulously coifed bangs . ''
