The Return of the King was shot during 2000 , though Astin 's coverage from Gollum 's attempt to separate Frodo and Sam was filmed on 24 November 1999 , when floods in Queenstown interrupted the focus on The Fellowship of the Ring . Some of the earliest scenes shot for the film were in fact the last . Hobbiton , home of the Hobbits , was shot in January 2000 with early scenes from The Fellowship of the Ring , with the exterior shot at a Matamata farm , while interior scenes shot at Stone Street Studios in Wellington , shared with the Grey Havens sequence . Due to the high emotions of filming the scene , the cast were in despair when they were required to shoot it three times , due to a continuity flaw in Sean Astin 's costume , and then negatives producing out - of - focus reels . Also shared with the previous films was the Rivendell interior in May .
