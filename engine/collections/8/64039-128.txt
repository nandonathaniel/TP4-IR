One World Trade Center is the second - tallest freestanding structure in the Western Hemisphere , as the CN Tower in Toronto exceeds One World Trade Center 's pinnacle height by approximately 12 m ( 39.4 ft ) . The Chicago Spire , with a planned height of 2,000 feet ( 610 m ) , was expected to exceed the height of One World Trade Center , but its construction was canceled due to financial difficulties in 2009 .
