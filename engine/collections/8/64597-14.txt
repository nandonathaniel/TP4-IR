The late sixth early fifth century BC lyric poet Pindar provides some of the earliest details of the battle between the Giants and the Olympians . He locates it `` on the plain of Phlegra '' and has Teiresias foretell Heracles killing Giants `` beneath ( his ) rushing arrows '' . He calls Heracles `` you who subdued the Giants '' , and has Porphyrion , who he calls `` the king of the Giants '' , being overcome by the bow of Apollo . Euripides ' Heracles has its hero shooting Giants with arrows , and his Ion has the chorus describe seeing a depiction of the Gigantomachy on the late sixth century Temple of Apollo at Delphi , with Athena fighting the Giant Enceladus with her `` gorgon shield '' , Zeus burning the Giant Mimas with his `` mighty thunderbolt , blazing at both ends '' , and Dionysus killing an unnamed Giant with his `` ivy staff '' .
