In the second phase of prophase I , zygotene ( from the Greek for `` conjugation '' ) , all maternally and paternally derived chromosomes have found their homologous partner . The homologous pairs then undergo synapsis , a process by which the synaptonemal complex ( a proteinaceous structure ) aligns corresponding regions of genetic information on maternally and paternally derived non-sister chromatids of homologous chromosome pairs . The paired homologous chromosome bound by the synaptonemal complex are referred to as bivalents or tetrads . Sex ( X and Y ) chromosomes do not fully synapse because only a small region of the chromosomes are homologous .
