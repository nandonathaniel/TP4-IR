In the Great Plains , the Lakota language , another indigenous language spoken throughout much of the bird 's range , the bird is called wabloša ( `` wings of red '' ) . Its songs are described in Lakota as tōke , mat'ā nī ( `` oh ! that I might die '' ) , as nakun miyē ( `` ... and me '' ) , as miš eyā ( `` me too ! '' ) , and as cap'cehlī ( `` a beaver 's running sore '' ) . And its name in nahuatl the Aztec idiom is `` acolchichilli '' that literally means `` red shoulder '' .
