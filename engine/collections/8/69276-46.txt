Although it was rumoured by the automotive press since the announcement of the production R8 in 2006 , it was only in August 2008 that spy shots of a convertible R8 `` Spider '' from filming scenes of the movie Iron Man 2 were published online . The photos showed a clearly visible `` soft - top '' roof , and the distinctive `` sideblade '' had been removed . The vehicle was formally unveiled at the 2009 Frankfurt Motor Show . Compared with the coup√© model , the convertible had extra chassis support , a pair of roll - over safety bars , as well as minor changes such as the location of the fuel filler . It was powered by the uneven firing 5.2 FSI V10 engine .
