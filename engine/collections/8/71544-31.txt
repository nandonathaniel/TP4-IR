Hugh McIntyre , a contributor for Forbes.com , pointed out that the song `` plays like an homage to ' 90s house music '' , writing that the uncredited vocals on the chorus `` steals the show from the verses which feature Lipa 's now - recognizable vocals '' . He concluded by deeming the song `` a natural progression from Harris ' last single '' . Mike Wass of Idolator regarded it as `` ( Harris ' ) most accessible and instantly catchy track since ' This Is What You Came For ' in 2016 '' , writing that it is `` guaranteed to be massive '' . Lauren O'Neill of Noisey opined that the song `` conjure up its summery vibe '' despite its inability to `` reach the quietly euphoric heights of a number of the moments from Funk Wav Bounces Vol. 1 '' . Ross McNeilage of MTV UK wrote that the song marks a `` return to more familiar territory '' , calling it `` a pulsating house track that is undoubtedly going to become the soundtrack to our summer '' and `` the year 's first bona fide sunshine banger '' . He also found it `` a lot more uplifting '' than Lipa 's previous dance collaboration with Martin Garrix , `` Scared to Be Lonely '' .
