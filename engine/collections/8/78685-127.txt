Interstate Highways are signed by a number placed on a trademarked red , white , and blue sign . The colors red , white , and blue are chosen because they are the colors of the American flag . In the original design , the name of the state was displayed above the highway number , but in many states , this area is now left blank , allowing for the printing of larger and more - legible digits . The sign usually measures 36 inches ( 91 cm ) high , and is 36 inches ( 91 cm ) wide for two - digit Interstates or 45 inches ( 110 cm ) for three - digit Interstates .
