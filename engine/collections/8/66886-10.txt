In early 20th century automobiles prior to the introduction of power steering , the effect of a flat or blowout on one of the front wheels tended to pull the steering mechanism toward the side with the flat tire . The use of a worm screw reduced this effect . Further worm drive development led to recirculating ball bearings to reduce frictional forces , which transmitted some steering force to the wheel . This aids vehicle control and reduces wear that could cause difficulties in steering precisely .
