Since the outbreak of war with Napoleonic France , Britain had enforced a naval blockade to choke off neutral trade to France , which the United States contested as illegal under international law . To man the blockade , Britain impressed American merchant sailors into the Royal Navy . Incidents such as the Chesapeake -- Leopard Affair inflamed anti-British sentiment . In 1811 , the British were in turn outraged by the Little Belt Affair , which resulted in the deaths of 11 British sailors . British political support for a Native American buffer state , which conducted raids on American settlers on the frontier , hindered American expansion . On June 18 , 1812 , President James Madison , after receiving heavy pressure from the War hawks in Congress , signed the American declaration of war into law . Senior figures such as Lord Liverpool and Lord Castlereagh believed it to have been an opportunistic ploy to annex Canada while Britain was fighting a war with France . The view was shared in much of New England , whose leaders bitterly disputed the numbers of US sailors the War hawks claimed had been impressed by the British .
