In June 2014 , Gunn stated that the film had always been planned as a 3D film , and `` Unlike many directors , I 've been actively involved with converting every shot to 3D , making sure it works perfectly for the story and the film , making sure it 's spectacular and immersive without being silly , distracting , or overly showy . '' Gunn also revealed that the IMAX 3D version would include shifting aspect ratios , to make the viewing experience `` even fuller and more encompassing . I 've personally chosen all the places where the changes occur ... The changing aspect ratios in this case are actually a part of the storytelling . '' In July 2014 , Gunn revealed that there were multiple scenes he had cut from the film , and he was investigating how to release them , either in an extended cut of the film , or as bonus features on the film 's home media release .
