The Allies mounted more gas attacks than the Germans in 1917 and 1918 because of a marked increase in production of gas from the Allied nations . Germany was unable to keep up with this pace despite creating various new gases for use in battle , mostly as a result of very costly methods of production . Entry into the war by the United States allowed the Allies to increase mustard gas production far more than Germany . Also the prevailing wind on the Western Front was blowing from west to east , which meant the British more frequently had favorable conditions for a gas release than did the Germans .
