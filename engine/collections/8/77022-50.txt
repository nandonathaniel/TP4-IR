Little Cassubia ( Polish : Ma≈Çe Kaszuby ) was a historical neighborhood in the Irving Park Community Area between Irving Park on the North , Addison to the South , Kimball to the West and Kedzie to the East . The name `` Little Cassubia '' was coined by locals because of the Kaszub people living in the area , who also founded the Roman Catholic Parish of Immaculate Heart of Mary .
