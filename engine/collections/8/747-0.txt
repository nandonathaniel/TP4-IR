The StarLink corn recalls occurred in the autumn of 2000 , when over 300 food products were found to contain a genetically modified corn that had not been approved for human consumption . It was the first - ever recall of a genetically modified food . The anti-GMO activist coalition Genetically Engineered Food Alert , which detected and first reported the contamination , was critical of the FDA for not doing its job . The recall of Taco Bell - branded taco shells , manufactured by Kraft Foods and sold in supermarkets , was the most publicized of the recalls . One settlement resulted in $60 million going to Taco Bell franchisees for lost sales due to the damage to the Taco Bell brand .
