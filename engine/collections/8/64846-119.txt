The costs of a disaster to states and localities can pile up quickly . Federal assistance becomes fully available with the approval of the President and at the request of the governor . Public help for governments to repair facilities is 75 % federally funded with local governments responsible for covering the rest ( unless the state grants aid or loans ) . FEMA does not compensate for buildings that have been improperly maintained by the state or local government nor does it pay to upgrade or improve facilities . FEMA coordinates but does not fund disaster assistance provided by the Small Business Administration or the Farmers Home Administration . FEMA grant - in aid funds come from revenue sharing , the Department of Housing and Urban Development and the Department of Transportation . Grants for disaster preparedness can be used by flood control districts .
