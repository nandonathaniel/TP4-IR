Colostrum will gradually change to become mature milk . In the first 3 -- 4 days it will appear thin and watery and will taste very sweet ; later , the milk will be thicker and creamier . Human milk quenches the baby 's thirst and hunger and provides the proteins , sugar , minerals , and antibodies that the baby needs .
