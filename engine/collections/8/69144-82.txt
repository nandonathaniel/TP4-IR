Besides the bright new uniforms there were some other changes . Lee May was traded to Baltimore for much talked about rookie second baseman Rob Andrews and utility player Enos Cabell . In Baltimore , Cabell was stuck behind third baseman Brooks Robinson , but he took advantage of his opportunity in Houston and became their everyday third baseman . Cabell would go on to become a big part of the team 's success in later years . With May gone , Bob Watson was able to move to first base and was a bright spot in the line up , batting . 324 with 85 RBI .
