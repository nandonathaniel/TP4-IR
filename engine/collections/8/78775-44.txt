When examining the relationship between Adam and Eve , some critics apply either an Adam - centered or Eve - centered view of hierarchy and importance to God . David Mikics argues , by contrast , these positions `` overstate the independence of the characters ' stances , and therefore miss the way in which Adam and Eve are entwined with each other '' . Milton 's narrative depicts a relationship where the husband and wife ( here , Adam and Eve ) depend on each other and , through each other 's differences , thrive . Still , there are several instances where Adam communicates directly with God while Eve must go through Adam to God ; thus , some have described Adam as her guide .
