Estimates suggest that the death rate of clergy in some parts of the archdiocese could have been as high as 48 % . This is reflected in the Ordination Register , which shows a massive rise in ordained clergy over the period -- some being recruited before the arrival of plague in a clerical recruitment drive , but many once plague had arrived , replacing those who had been killed . The nation 's population decreased by a third causing a labor shortage and giving the lower class negotiating power against their overlords . In 1346 , 111 priests and 337 acolytes were recruited . In 1349 , 299 priests and 683 acolytes are named , with 166 priests being ordained in one session alone in February 1350 . ''
