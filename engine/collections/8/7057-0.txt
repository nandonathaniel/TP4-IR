In the Abilene paradox , a group of people collectively decide on a course of action that is counter to the preferences of many or all of the individuals in the group . It involves a common breakdown of group communication in which each member mistakenly believes that their own preferences are counter to the group 's and , therefore , does not raise objections . A common phrase relating to the Abilene Paradox is a desire not to `` rock the boat '' . This differs from groupthink in that the Abilene paradox is characterized by an inability to manage agreement .
