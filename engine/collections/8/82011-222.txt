The Mahabharata has a summary of the Ramayana . The Jainism tradition has extensive literature of Rama as well , but generally refers to him as Padma , such as in the Paumacariya by Vimalasuri . Rama and Sita legend is mentioned in the Jataka tales of Buddhism , as Dasaratha - Jataka ( Tale no . 461 ) , but with slightly different spellings such as Lakkhana for Lakshmana and Rama - pandita for Rama .
