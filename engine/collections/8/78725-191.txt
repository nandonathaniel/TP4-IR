The first 5,000 - square - foot ( 460 m ) zero - energy design home was built in 1979 with support from President Carter 's new United States Department of Energy . It relied heavily on passive solar building design for space heat , water heat and space cooling . It heated and cooled itself effectively in a climate where the summer peak temperature was 110 degrees Fahrenheit , and the winter low temperature was âˆ’ 10 F. It did not use active solar systems . It is a double envelope house that uses a gravity - fed natural convection air flow design to circulate passive solar heat from 1,000 square feet ( 93 m ) of south - facing glass on its greenhouse through a thermal buffer zone in the winter . A swimming pool in the greenhouse provided thermal mass for winter heat storage . In the summer , air from two 24 - inch ( 610 mm ) 100 - foot - long ( 30 m ) underground earth tubes is used to cool the thermal buffer zone and exhaust heat through 7200 cfm of outer - envelope roof vents .
