Most sources credit St. Louis University 's Bradbury Robinson from Bellevue , Ohio with throwing the first legal forward pass . On September 5 , 1906 , in a game against Carroll College , Robinson 's first attempt at a forward pass fell incomplete and resulted in a turnover under the 1906 rules . In the same game , Robinson later completed a 20 - yard touchdown pass to Jack Schneider . The 1906 St. Louis team , coached by Eddie Cochems , was undefeated at 11 -- 0 and featured the most potent offense in the country , outscoring their opponents 407 -- 11 . Football authority and College Football Hall of Fame coach David M. Nelson wrote that `` E.B. Cochems is to forward passing what the Wright brothers are to aviation and Thomas Edison is to the electric light . ''
