Economist Gary Becker has described educational attainment as the root of economic mobility . Progressive tax rates , while raising taxes on high income , have the goal and corresponding effect of reducing the burden on low income , improving income equality . Educational attainment is often conditional on cost and family income , which for the poor , reduces their opportunity for educational attainment . Increases in income for the poor and economic equality reduces the inequality of educational attainment . Tax policy can also include progressive features that provide tax incentives for education , such as tax credits and tax exemptions for scholarships and grants .
