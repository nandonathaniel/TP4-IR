An ability attributed to Veela and those of Veela heritage , such as Fleur Delacour . It is used to charm males , much like the Sirens in The Odyssey . Men who are exposed to it over time become more resistant to it , although the Veela charm takes full effect if the Veela surprises the man , as noted by Ron in Half - Blood Prince .
