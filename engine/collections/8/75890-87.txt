With steam , mass - produced steel plate , and exploding shells , European gunships permitted the New Imperialism of the 19th century , forcing open access to Africa , China , Korea , and Japan for their merchants on favorable terms . Although internal politics hampered Chinese modernization , American naval power produced a major reform in Japan which bore fruit during the 1905 Battle of Tsushima when the Japanese were able to decisively defeat Russia . The great navies initially focused their efforts on constructing great dreadnoughts and battleships , but these fought inconclusively in the First World War . By contrast , the much cheaper German U-boats showed that submarines could cripple shipping even in waters nominally controlled by the enemy . Convoys , intelligence , and airborne anti-submarine warfare ( ASW ) won a hard - fought victory in the Second World War 's Battle of the Atlantic , but developments in applied physics meant that by the 1960s nuclear - powered ballistic missile submarines were being maintained on constant patrol as a second - strike force along with a second set of hunters intended to counter them . Meanwhile , the battles of the Mediterranean and Pacific theaters of the war had shown that air power was capable of overcoming the strongest warships .
