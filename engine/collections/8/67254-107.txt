Solitary confinement is widely used in US prisons , yet it is underreported by most states , while some do n't report it at all . Isolation of prisoners has been condemned by the UN in 2011 as a form of torture . At over 80,000 at any given time , the US has more prisoners confined in isolation than any other country in the world . In Louisiana , with 843 prisoners per 100,000 citizens , there have been prisoners , such as the Angola Three , held for as long as forty years in isolation .
