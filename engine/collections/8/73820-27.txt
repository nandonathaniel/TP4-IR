Although the Higgs field is non-zero everywhere and its effects ubiquitous , proving its existence was far from easy . In principle , it can be proved to exist by detecting its excitations , which manifest as Higgs particles ( the Higgs boson ) , but these are extremely difficult to produce and to detect . The importance of this fundamental question led to a 40 - year search , and the construction of one of the world 's most expensive and complex experimental facilities to date , CERN 's Large Hadron Collider , in an attempt to create Higgs bosons and other particles for observation and study . On 4 July 2012 , the discovery of a new particle with a mass between 125 and 7002127000000000000 â™  127 GeV / c was announced ; physicists suspected that it was the Higgs boson . Since then , the particle has been shown to behave , interact , and decay in many of the ways predicted for Higgs particles by the Standard Model , as well as having even parity and zero spin , two fundamental attributes of a Higgs boson . This also means it is the first elementary scalar particle discovered in nature . As of 2018 , in - depth research shows the particle continuing to behave in line with predictions for the Standard Model Higgs boson . More studies are needed to verify with higher precision that the discovered particle has all of the properties predicted , or whether , as described by some theories , multiple Higgs bosons exist .
