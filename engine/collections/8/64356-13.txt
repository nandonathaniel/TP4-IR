Israel is a Biblical given name . The patriarch Jacob was given the name Israel ( Hebrew : יִשְׂרָאֵל ‬ , Standard Yisraʾel Tiberian Yiśrāʾēl ) after he `` wrestled with the angel '' ( Genesis 32 : 28 and 35 : 10 ) . The given name is already attested in Eblaite ( 𒅖𒊏𒅋 , išrail ) and Ugaritic ( 𐎊𐎌𐎗𐎛𐎍 , yšrʾil ) . Commentators differ on the original literal interpretation . The text of Genesis etymologizes the name with the root śarah `` to rule , contend , have power , prevail over '' : שָׂרִיתָ עִם ־ אֱלֹהִים ‬ ( KJV : `` a prince hast thou power with God '' ) , but modern suggestions read the el as the subject , for a translation of `` El / God rules / judges / struggles '' , `` El fights / struggles '' .
