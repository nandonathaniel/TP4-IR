The basal ganglia -- the part of the brain most prominently affected in early HD -- play a key role in movement and behavior control . Their functions are not fully understood , but current theories propose that they are part of the cognitive executive system and the motor circuit . The basal ganglia ordinarily inhibit a large number of circuits that generate specific movements . To initiate a particular movement , the cerebral cortex sends a signal to the basal ganglia that causes the inhibition to be released . Damage to the basal ganglia can cause the release or reinstatement of the inhibitions to be erratic and uncontrolled , which results in an awkward start to motion or motions to be unintentionally initiated , or a motion to be halted before , or beyond , its intended completion . The accumulating damage to this area causes the characteristic erratic movements associated with HD . The spontaneous and erratic physical movements associated with HD are classified as a type of hyperkinetic dysarthria . Because of the basal ganglia 's inability to inhibit movements , individuals affected by it will inevitably experience a reduced ability to produce speech and swallow foods and liquids ( dysphagia ) .
