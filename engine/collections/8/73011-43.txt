Both PS and phosphatidylinositol - 4 , 5 - bisphosphate ( PIP2 ) can regulate membrane mechanical function , due to their interactions with skeletal proteins such as spectrin and protein 4.1 R. Recent studies have shown that binding of spectrin to PS promotes membrane mechanical stability . PIP2 enhances the binding of protein band 4.1 R to glycophorin C but decreases its interaction with protein band 3 , and thereby may modulate the linkage of the bilayer to the membrane skeleton .
