United States customary units are a system of measurements commonly used in the United States . The United States customary system ( USCS or USC ) developed from English units which were in use in the British Empire before the U.S. became an independent country . However , the United Kingdom 's system of measures was overhauled in 1824 to create the imperial system , changing the definitions of some units . Therefore , while many U.S. units are essentially similar to their Imperial counterparts , there are significant differences between the systems .
