The rapier is believed to have evolved either from the Spanish espada ropera or from the swords of the Italian nobility somewhere in the later part of the 16th century . The rapier differed from most earlier swords in that it was not a military weapon but a primarily civilian sword . Both the rapier and the Italian schiavona developed the crossguard into a basket - shaped guard for hand protection . During the 17th and 18th centuries , the shorter smallsword became an essential fashion accessory in European countries and the New World , though in some places such as the Scottish Highlands large swords as the basket - hilted broadsword were preferred , and most wealthy men and military officers carried one slung from a belt . Both the smallsword and the rapier remained popular dueling swords well into the 18th century .
