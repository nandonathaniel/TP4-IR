`` Results show that climate change is likely to reduce agricultural production , thus reducing food availability '' ( Brown etal. , 2008 . ) `` The food security threat posed by climate change is greatest for Africa , where agricultural yields and per capita food production has been steadily declining , and where population growth will double the demand for food , water , and livestock forage in the next 30 years '' ( Devereux et al. , 2004 ). In 2060 , the hungry population could range from 641 million to 2087 million with climate change ( Chen et al. , 1994 ) . By the year 2030 , Cereal crops will decrease from 15 to 19 percent , temperatures are estimated to rise from 1 degrees Celsius to 2 . 75 degrees Celsius , which will lead to less rainfall , which will all result in an increase in food insecurity in 2030 ( Devereux etal , 2004 ) . In prediction farming countries will be the worst sectors hit , hot countries and drought countries will reach even higher temperatures and richer countries will be hit the least as they have more access to more resources ( Devereux et al. 2004 ) . From a food security perspective , climate change is the dominant rationale to the increase in recent years and predicted years to come .
