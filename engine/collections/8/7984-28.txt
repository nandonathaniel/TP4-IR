Allmusic writer Andy Kellman gave it three and a half out of five stars and called the soundtrack `` an enjoyable if muddled affair '' and commended the four songs covered on the new soundtrack stating `` the 2012 soundtrack features faithful and decent covers of four songs from the original . When it comes to `` Something He Can Feel , '' it would be an understatement to say that the deck is stacked against Sparks and her vocal partners , Carmen Ejogo and Tika Sumpter . '' Entertainment Weekly 's Melissa Maerz gave Sparkle : Original Motion Picture Soundtrack a B rating and praised Sparks version of `` Look Into Your Heart '' stating `` Sparks bellows Mayfield 's power ballad Look Into Your Heart with absolute conviction . Jody Rosen of Rolling Stone gave the soundtrack 31‚ÅÑ2 of 5 stars , commenting that `` Sparkle revives four soul chestnuts and includes three originals written and produced by R. Kelly . It 's the second-most - satisfying retro - soul album of the year -- after Kelly 's Write Me Back '' ; however , he was ambivalent towards Houston 's last two recordings before her passing , saying that , `` Celebrate is forgettable disco - pop , and on the gospel standard `` His Eye Is on the Sparrow '' Houston sings -- and croaks -- in a voice octaves lower than in her prime . At times the song has a ravaged magnificence , but mostly it 's painful . ''
