Bobby and Oliver ( Robbie Rist ) jump to all sorts of conclusions when Mike is visited by Fred Sanders ( Don Fenwick ) , an FBI agent ( to get security clearances for a government project ) , and subsequently is asked to help Sam with a `` top secret '' project to expand his store . The boys believe Sam is passing information to the Russians when they see him conferring with his landlord , Mr. Gronsky ( Lew Palter ) , about the project , and lock Sam and Gronsky in the meat locker . Mike is able to free the two and everything is cleared up . Meanwhile Sam 's request of Mike to draw plans for a `` top secret '' project lead Alice , Carol , Marcia , Jan and Cindy to assume that he is about to ask Alice to marry him , and that Mike is designing a home for them . Note : This is Allan Melvin 's final appearance as Sam Franklin .
