McKellen has appeared in limited release films , such as Emile ( which was shot in three weeks following the X2 shoot ) , Neverwas and Asylum . He appeared as Sir Leigh Teabing in The Da Vinci Code . During a 17 May 2006 interview on The Today Show with the Da Vinci Code cast and director , Matt Lauer posed a question to the group about how they would have felt if the film had borne a prominent disclaimer that it is a work of fiction , as some religious groups wanted . McKellen responded , `` I 've often thought the Bible should have a disclaimer in the front saying ' This is fiction . ' I mean , walking on water ? It takes ... an act of faith . And I have faith in this movie -- not that it 's true , not that it 's factual , but that it 's a jolly good story . '' He continued , `` And I think audiences are clever enough and bright enough to separate out fact and fiction , and discuss the thing when they 've seen it '' . McKellen appeared in the 2006 BBC series of Ricky Gervais ' comedy series Extras , where he played himself directing Gervais ' character Andy Millman in a play about gay lovers .
