As mentioned earlier , the cooperatives had very mixed success ; and the majority were converted into individual private holdings during the 1980s . The conversions were authorized in 1980 by changes in the basic land reform legislation and were put into effect after majority votes of the cooperative members in each case . The preferences of the people involved at that point clearly went contrary to the intent of the original reform . But the whole set of changes was not a reversion to the pre-reform agrarian structure . In fact , the conversions left Peru with a far less unequal pattern of landownership than it had prior to the reform and with a much greater role for family farming than ever before in its history .
