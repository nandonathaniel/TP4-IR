Tigervision , Clemson 's student - run TV station , broadcasts on channel 88 on the university 's campus cable network . The station was created in 1994 under the name Clemson Cable Network by students at WSBF - FM who were interested in television production . The station aired a variety of student created content as well as recently released movies via a licensing agreement . By 2006 , after experiencing a decline in membership and viewers , CCN was no longer consistently producing content and fell into relative obscurity . However , in 2007 , CCN was reorganized into Clemson Television and began to produce student comedy shows as well as airing public domain films . As content quality began to increase , so did membership . In 2014 , CTV was renamed Tigervision to coincide with its switch to high definition broadcasting .
