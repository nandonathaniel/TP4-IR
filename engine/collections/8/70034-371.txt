On December 12 , the Supreme Soviet of the Russian SFSR formally ratified the Belavezha Accords and renounced the 1922 Union Treaty . It also recalled the Russian deputies from the Supreme Soviet of the USSR . The legality of this action was questionable , since Soviet law did not allow a republic to unilaterally recall its deputies . However , no one in either Russia or the Kremlin objected . Any objections from the latter would have likely had no effect , since the Soviet government had effectively been rendered impotent long before December . On the surface , it appeared that the largest republic had formally seceded . However , this is not the case . Russia apparently took the line that it was not possible to secede from a country that no longer existed . Later that day , Gorbachev hinted for the first time that he was considering stepping down .
