Deaths among former slaves has proven much harder to estimate , due to the lack of reliable census data at the time , though they were known to be considerable , as former slaves were set free or escaped in massive numbers in an area where the Union army did not have sufficient shelter , doctors , or food for them . University of Connecticut Professor James Downs states that tens to hundreds of thousands of slaves died during the war from disease , starvation , exposure , or execution at the hands of the Confederates , and that if these deaths are counted in the war 's total , the death toll would exceed 1 million .
