A major advance was the introduction of the caravel in the mid-15th century , a small ship able to sail windward more than any other in Europe at the time . Evolved from fishing ships designs , they were the first that could leave the coastal cabotage navigation and sail safely on the open Atlantic . For celestial navigation the Portuguese used the Ephemerides , which experienced a remarkable diffusion in the 15th century . These were astronomical charts plotting the location of the stars over a distinct period of time . Published in 1496 by the Jewish astronomer , astrologer , and mathematician Abraham Zacuto , the Almanach Perpetuum included some of these tables for the movements of stars . These tables revolutionized navigation , allowing the calculation of latitude . Exact longitude , however , remained elusive , and mariners struggled to determine it for centuries . Using the caravel , systematic exploration continued ever more southerly , advancing on average one degree a year . Senegal and Cape Verde Peninsula were reached in 1445 and in 1446 , √Ålvaro Fernandes pushed on almost as far as present - day Sierra Leone .
