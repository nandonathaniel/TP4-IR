The Palestinian Authority believes that the West Bank ought to be a part of their sovereign nation , and that the presence of Israeli military control is a violation of their right to Palestinian Authority rule . The United Nations calls the West Bank and Gaza Strip Israeli - occupied territories . The United States State Department also refers to the territories as occupied . Many Israelis and their supporters prefer the term disputed territories , because they claim part of the territory for themselves , and state that the land has not for 2000 years been sovereign .
