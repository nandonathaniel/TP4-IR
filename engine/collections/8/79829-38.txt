While hunting had been illegal in the national park of the Virunga Volcanoes in Rwanda since the 1920s , the law was rarely enforced by park conservators , who were often bribed by poachers and paid a salary less than Fossey 's own African staff . On three occasions , Fossey wrote that she witnessed the aftermath of the capture of infant gorillas at the behest of the park conservators for zoos ; since gorillas will fight to the death to protect their young , the kidnappings would often result in up to 10 adult gorillas ' deaths . Through the Digit Fund , Fossey financed patrols to destroy poachers ' traps in the Karisoke study area . In four months in 1979 , the Fossey patrol consisting of four African staffers destroyed 987 poachers ' traps in the research area 's vicinity . The official Rwandan national park guards , consisting of 24 staffers , did not eradicate any poachers ' traps during the same period . In the eastern portion of the park not patrolled by Fossey , poachers virtually eradicated all the park 's elephants for ivory and killed more than a dozen gorillas .
