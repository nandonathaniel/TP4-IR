The crew had been authorised to carry out a display at Chicago Lakeside airport , the captain had elected to carry out an unauthorised display at Glenview beforehand . After a low - level run , probably below 100 ft ( 30 m ) , the aircraft pulled up for an improperly executed wingover , resulting in a low - level stall and crash , killing all on board .
