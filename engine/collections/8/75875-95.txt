The Battle of Jinyang saw the allied Han , Zhao and Wei destroy the Zhi family ( 453 BC ) and their lands were distributed among them . With this , they became the `` de facto '' rulers of most of Jin 's territory , though this situation would not be officially recognised until half a century later . The Jin division created a political vacuum that enabled during the first 50 years expansion of Chu and Yue northward and Qi southward . Qin increased its control of the local tribes and began its expansion southwest to Sichuan .
