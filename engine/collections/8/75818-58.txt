In `` The Hierarchy Itself : Hurston 's Their Eyes Were Watching God and the Sacrifice of Narrative Authority , '' Ryan Simmons argues that Hurston made a statement against models of authority that supplant an oppressive system with other oppressive systems and offered an alternative . By models of authority , Simmons means the narrative voice of the author and Janie 's narrative voice . Hurston represented the different ideologies of Booker T. Washington and W.E.B. Du Bois through the characters of Logan Killicks and Joe ( `` Jody '' ) Starks . Like Washington , Logan models the path of `` gradual progress '' that would not threaten the white - dominated sphere of power and Hurston presents his practices as a tradeoff between liberty and modest prosperity . Joe models the path advocated by Du Bois , which is one of assertion of dignity and less compromise . However , the issue shown by Joe 's eventual isolation from the community dialogue he helped establish and Janie 's overpowering of him through a usurpation of authority , Hurston shows that the weakness with Joe 's approach is that it mirrors that of white suppression .
