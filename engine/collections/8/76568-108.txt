He works at his father 's pawn shop `` Mohumbhai & Son '' and dispenses off - kilter advice about women and life in America . He still lives with his parents , though he tries to cover it up by pretending they are his crazy roommates who just think they are his parents . Bret and Jemaine overestimate Dave 's expertise with women , and often go to him for relationship advice .
