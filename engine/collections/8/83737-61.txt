There were some exceptions to removal . Approximately 100 Cherokees evaded the U.S. soldiers and lived off the land in Georgia and other states . Those Cherokees who lived on private , individually owned lands ( rather than communally owned tribal land ) were not subject to removal . In North Carolina , about 400 Cherokees , known as the Oconaluftee Cherokee , lived on land in the Great Smoky Mountains owned by a white man named William Holland Thomas ( who had been adopted by Cherokees as a boy ) , and were thus not subject to removal . Added to this were some 200 Cherokee from the Nantahala area allowed to stay in the Qualla Boundary after assisting the U.S. Army in hunting down and capturing the family of the old prophet , Tsali ( who faced a firing squad after capture ) . These North Carolina Cherokees became the Eastern Band of the Cherokee Nation .
