French military superiority might have allowed him to press for more advantageous terms . Thus , his generosity to Spain with regard to Catalonia has been read as a concession to foster pro-French sentiment and may ultimately have induced King Charles II to name Louis ' grandson Philip , Duke of Anjou , as heir to the throne of Spain . In exchange for financial compensation , France renounced its interests in the Electorate of Cologne and the Palatinate . Lorraine , which had been occupied by the French since 1670 , was returned to its rightful Duke Leopold , albeit with a right of way to the French military . William and Mary were recognised as joint sovereigns of the British Isles , and Louis withdrew support for James II . The Dutch were given the right to garrison forts in the Spanish Netherlands that acted as a protective barrier against possible French aggression . Though in some respects , the Treaty of Ryswick may appear a diplomatic defeat for Louis since he failed to place client rulers in control of the Palatinate or the Electorate of Cologne , he did in fact fulfill many of the aims laid down in his 1688 ultimatum . In any case , peace in 1697 was desirable to Louis , since France was exhausted from the costs of the war .
