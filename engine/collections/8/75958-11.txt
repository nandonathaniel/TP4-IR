The narrator of the story is a British journalist in 19th Century India -- Kipling himself , in all but name . Whilst on a tour of some Indian native states he meets two scruffy adventurers , Daniel Dravot and Peachey Carnehan . Softened by their stories , he agrees to help them in a minor errand , but later he regrets this and informs the authorities about them -- preventing them from blackmailing a minor rajah . A few months later the pair appear at his newspaper office in Lahore . They tell him of a plan they have hatched . They declare that after years of trying their hands at all manner of things , they have decided that `` India is not big enough for them '' . They plan to go to Kafiristan and set themselves up as kings . Dravot will pass as a native and , armed with twenty Martini - Henry rifles , they plan to find a king or chief to help him defeat enemies . Once that is done , they will take over for themselves . They ask the narrator for the use of books , encyclopedias and maps of the area -- as a favour , because they are fellow Freemasons , and because he spoiled their blackmail scheme . They also show him a contract they have drawn up between themselves which swears loyalty between the pair and total abstinence from women and alcohol .
