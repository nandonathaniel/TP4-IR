Farmer - managed natural regeneration ( FMNR ) is another technique that has produced successful results for desert reclamation . Since 1980 , this method to reforest degraded landscape has been applied with some success in Niger . This simple and low - cost method has enabled farmers to regenerate some 30,000 square kilometers in Niger . The process involves enabling native sprouting tree growth through selective pruning of shrub shoots . The residue from pruned trees can be used to provide mulching for fields thus increasing soil water retention and reducing evaporation . Additionally , properly spaced and pruned trees can increase crop yields . The Humbo Assisted Regeneration Project which uses FMNR techniques in Ethiopia has received money from The World Bank 's BioCarbon Fund , which supports projects that sequester or conserve carbon in forests or agricultural ecosystems .
