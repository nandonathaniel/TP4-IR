After the end of the first World War , most men adopted the short lounge coated suit . Long coats quickly went out of fashion for everyday wear and business , and the morning coat gained its current classification of `` formal '' . During the 1920s , short suits were always worn except on formal occasions in the daytime , when a morning coat would be worn . Older , more conservative men continued to wear a frock coat , or `` Prince Albert coat '' as it was known .
