The Gold Coast 600 ( formerly known as Lexmark Indy 300 ) is a car racing event held annually , usually in October . The course runs through the streets of Surfers Paradise and Main Beach . The GC 600 comprises many other events such as the Indy Undie Ball and the Miss Indy Competition . Formerly an Indy car event , V8 Supercars are now the headline attraction , using a similar track route , as the circuit was cut in half by a hairpin . The Magic Millions carnival is the brainchild of entrepreneurs Gerry Harvey ( of Harvey Normans ) and John Singleton . There are plans to relocate and build a state - of - the - art new racetrack at Palm Meadows which will incorporate the Magic Million sale with facilities for up to 4000 horses .
