In genetics and developmental biology , somatic cell nuclear transfer ( SCNT ) is a laboratory strategy for creating a viable embryo from a body cell and an egg cell . The technique consists of taking an enucleated oocyte ( egg cell ) and implanting a donor nucleus from a somatic ( body ) cell . It is used in both therapeutic and reproductive cloning . Dolly the Sheep became famous for being the first successful case of the reproductive cloning of a mammal . `` Therapeutic cloning '' refers to the potential use of SCNT in regenerative medicine ; this approach has been championed as an answer to the many issues concerning embryonic stem cells ( ESC ) and the destruction of viable embryos for medical use , though questions remain on how homologous the two cell types truly are .
