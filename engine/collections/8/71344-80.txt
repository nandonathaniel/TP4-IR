We prefer , however , our system of industry , by which labor and capital are identified in interest , and capital , therefore , protects labor -- by which our population doubles every twenty years -- by which starvation is unknown , and abundance crowns the land -- by which order is preserved by unpaid police , and the most fertile regions of the world , where the white man can not labor , are brought into usefulness by the labor of the African , and the whole world is blessed by our own productions ... We ask you to join us , in forming a Confederacy of Slaveholding States .
