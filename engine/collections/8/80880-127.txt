During high school , students ( usually in 11th grade ) may take one or more standardized tests depending on their post-secondary education preferences and their local graduation requirements . In theory , these tests evaluate the overall level of knowledge and learning aptitude of the students . The SAT and ACT are the most common standardized tests that students take when applying to college . A student may take the SAT , ACT , or both depending upon the post-secondary institutions the student plans to apply to for admission . Most competitive schools also require two or three SAT Subject Tests ( formerly known as SAT IIs ) , which are shorter exams that focus strictly on a particular subject matter . However , all these tests serve little to no purpose for students who do not move on to post-secondary education , so they can usually be skipped without affecting one 's ability to graduate .
