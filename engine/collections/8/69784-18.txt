Miss Rabbit ( voiced by Sarah Ann Kennedy ) -- Miss Rabbit appears to have many jobs at the same time , including bus driver , supermarket assistant , librarian , helicopter pilot , firefighter , ice cream seller , shoe shop assistant , nurse , ticket seller , and more , but she loves her jobs . She is Mummy Rabbit 's twin sister , and is Rebecca , Richard , Rosie , and Robbie 's aunt . She wears a yellow dress , like her twin sister . Some people think there is more than one Miss Rabbit but this has not been said in the show , possibly because seeing many Miss Rabbits at the same time would be confusing for kids .
