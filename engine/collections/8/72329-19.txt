The Governor Harry W. Nice Memorial Bridge , also known as the Potomac River Bridge , is a 1.7 - mile ( 2.7 km ) , two - lane continuous truss bridge that spans the Potomac River between Newburg in Charles County , Maryland and Dahlgren in King George County , Virginia , United States . The bridge is narrow ( one 11 - foot ( 3.4 m ) lane in each direction with no shoulders ) , steep ( up to 3.75 percent grade ) , and has a reduced speed limit ( 50 mph on the main span , even slower through the toll gates and plaza ) . By contrast , the approach roads on both sides of the bridge feature four 12 - foot ( 3.7 m ) lanes ( 2 in each direction ) , full shoulders , and 55 mph speed limits . This combination forces vehicles to slow and merge as they cross the bridge , which often results in backups .
