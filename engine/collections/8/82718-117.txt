The Inca Empire employed central planning . The Inca Empire traded with outside regions , although they did not operate a substantial internal market economy . While axe - monies were used along the northern coast , presumably by the provincial mindaláe trading class , most households in the empire lived in a traditional economy in which households were required to pay taxes , usually in the form of the mit'a corvée labor , and military obligations , though barter ( or trueque ) was present in some areas . In return , the state provided security , food in times of hardship through the supply of emergency resources , agricultural projects ( e.g. aqueducts and terraces ) to increase productivity and occasional feasts . The economy rested on the material foundations of the vertical archipelago , a system of ecological complementarity in accessing resources and the cultural foundation of ayni , or reciprocal exchange .
