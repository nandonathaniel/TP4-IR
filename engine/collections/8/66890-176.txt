In most states , major party candidates for each district are nominated in partisan primary elections , typically held in spring to late summer . In some states , the Republican and Democratic parties choose their respective candidates for each district in their political conventions in spring or early summer , which often use unanimous voice votes to reflect either confidence in the incumbent or the result of bargaining in earlier private discussions . Exceptions can result in so - called floor fight -- convention votes by delegates , with outcomes that can be hard to predict . Especially if a convention is closely divided , a losing candidate may contend further by meeting the conditions for a primary election .
