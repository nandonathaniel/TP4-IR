Interspecific competition results from a high density of species with similar niches in the tropics and limited resources available . Species which `` lose '' the competition may either become extinct or find a new niche . Direct competition will often lead to one species dominating another by some advantage , ultimately driving it to extinction . Niche partitioning is the other option for a species . This is the separation and rationing of necessary resources by utilizing different habitats , food sources , cover or general behavioral differences . A species with similar food items but different feeding times is an example of niche partitioning .
