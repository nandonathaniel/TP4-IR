At the end of the 19th century there were only two typefoundries left in the Netherlands : Johan Enschedé & Zonen , at Haarlem , and Lettergieterij Amsterdam , voorheen Tetterode . They both had their own type - height : Enschedé : 65 23 / 24 points Didot , and Amsterdam : 66 1 / 24 points Didot . Enough difference to prevent a combined use of fonts of both typefoundries : Enschede would be to light , or otherwise the Amsterdam - font would print rather bold . A perfect way of binding clients .
