In October 2011 , the Girl Scouts of Colorado council publicly stated , `` If a child identifies as a girl and the child 's family presents her as a girl , Girl Scouts of Colorado welcomes her as a Girl Scout '' , when overturning a local troop 's rejection of a seven - year - old transgender girl . In July 2015 , the Girl Scouts of Western Washington returned a $100,000 donation after the donor stipulated that the money could not be used to support services for transgender Scouts . The group then set up an online fundraising campaign to recoup the lost funds , ultimately raising $250,000 .
