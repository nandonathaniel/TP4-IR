World War I added to the chaos . Conscription swept up the unwilling across Russia . The vast demand for factory production of war supplies and workers caused many more labor riots and strikes . Conscription stripped skilled workers from the cities , who had to be replaced with unskilled peasants , and then , when famine began to hit due to the poor railway system , workers abandoned the cities in droves seeking food . Finally , the soldiers themselves , who suffered from a lack of equipment and protection from the elements , began to turn against the Tsar . This was mainly because , as the war progressed , many of the officers who were loyal to the Tsar were killed , and were replaced by discontented conscripts from the major cities , who had little loyalty to the Tsar .
