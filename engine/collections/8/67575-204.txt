In the summer of 2012 , MTV launched a music discovery web site called Artists. MTV . MTV stated , `` While technology has made it way easier for artists to produce and distribute their own music on their own terms , it has n't made it any simpler to find a way to cut through all the Internet noise and speak directly to all of their potential fans . The summer launch of Artists. MTV is an attempt to help music junkies and musicians close the gap by providing a one - stop place where fans can listen to and buy music and purchase concert tickets and merchandise . ''
