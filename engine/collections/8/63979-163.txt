During the planning and building phase of the stadium , the stadium was referred to as Dolphin Stadium . The stadium was named after Joe Robbie , the original and then - owner of the Miami Dolphins and stadium in 1987 , when it opened . In the early 1990s , Wayne Huizenga gained control of the stadium . Huizenga first sold the naming rights to Pro Player , the sports apparel division of Fruit of the Loom , and Joe Robbie Stadium became Pro Player Park on August 26 , 1996 and shortly later Pro Player Stadium .
