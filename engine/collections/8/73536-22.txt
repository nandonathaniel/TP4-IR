The Company built Sea Venture , probably in Aldeburgh , as England 's first purpose - designed emigrant ship and in response to the inadequacy of its vessels . She measured `` 300 tunnes '' , cost Â£ 1,500 , and differed from her contemporaries primarily in her internal arrangements . Her guns were placed on her main deck , rather than below decks as was then the norm . This meant that the ship did not need double - timbering , and she may have been the first single - timbered , armed merchant ship built in England . The hold was sheathed and furnished for passengers . She was armed with eight 9 - pounder ( 4.1 kg ) demi - culverins , eight 5 - pounder ( 2.3 kg ) sakers , four 3 - pounder ( 1.4 kg ) falcons , and four arquebuses . The ship was launched in 1609 , and her uncompleted journey to Jamestown appears to have been her maiden voyage .
