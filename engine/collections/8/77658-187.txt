As with many linguists working on Native American languages , Athabaskanists tend to use an Americanist phonetic notation system rather than IPA . Although some Athabaskanists prefer IPA symbols today , the weight of tradition is particularly heavy in historical and comparative linguistics , hence the Americanist symbols are still in common use for descriptions of Proto - Athabaskan and in comparisons between members of the family . In the tables in this section , the proto - phonemes are given in their conventional Athabaskanist forms with IPA equivalents following in square brackets .
