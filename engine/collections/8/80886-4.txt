Creditors holding liens against real estate can include primary mortgages , second mortgages , home equity lines of credit ( HELOC ) , homeowner association liens , mechanics liens , IRS and State Tax Liens , all of which will need to approve the sale in return for being paid less than the amount they are owed . The lien holders do not have to agree to accept less , but they often do since the alternative is to let the property go to foreclosure .
