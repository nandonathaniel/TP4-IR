In April 1906 , When Shastri was hardly one year old , his father , had only recently been promoted to the post of deputy tahsildar , died in an epidemic of bubonic plague . Ramdulari Devi , then only 23 and pregnant with her third child , took her two children and moved from Ramnnagar to her father 's house in Mughalsarai and settled there for good . She gave birth to a daughter , Sundari Devi , in July 1906 . Thus , Shastri and his sisters grew up in the household of his maternal grandfather , Hazari Lal . However , Hazari Lal himself died from a stroke in mid-1908 , after which the family were looked after by his brother ( Shastri 's great - uncle ) Darbari Lal , who was the head clerk in the opium regulation department at Ghazipur , and later by his son ( Ramdulari Devi 's cousin ) Bindeshwari Prasad , a school teacher in Mughalsarai .
