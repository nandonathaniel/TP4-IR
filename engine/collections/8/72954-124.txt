The Royal Prerogative includes the powers to appoint and dismiss ministers , regulate the civil service , issue passports , declare war , make peace , direct the actions of the military , and negotiate and ratify treaties , alliances , and international agreements . However , a treaty can not alter the domestic laws of the United Kingdom ; an Act of Parliament is necessary in such cases . The monarch is commander - in - chief of the Armed Forces ( the Royal Navy , the British Army , and the Royal Air Force ) , accredits British High Commissioners and ambassadors , and receives diplomats from foreign states .
