In 2004 , EA signed an exclusive license through 2009 with the NFL and the NFLPI to give the company the exclusive rights to use the NFL 's teams , stadia , and players in a video game . This exclusive license prevents other official NFL video games . The deal , reportedly worth $300 million and later extended to 2013 , has been widely criticized .
