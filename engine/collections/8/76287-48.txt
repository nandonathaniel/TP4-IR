A 2012 study by The Pew Charitable Trusts estimates that 24 % of the voting - eligible population in the United States are not registered to vote , a percentage that represents `` at least 51 million eligible U.S. citizens . '' Numerous states had a history of creating barriers to voter registration through a variety of fees , literacy or comprehension tests , and record - keeping requirements that in practice discriminated against racial or ethnic minorities , language minorities , and other groups . The Voting Rights Act of 1965 forbade such abuses and authorized federal oversight in jurisdictions of historic under - representation of certain groups . States continue to develop new practices that may discriminate against certain populations . By August 2016 , federal rulings in five cases have overturned all or parts of voter registration or voter ID laws in Ohio , Texas , North Carolina , Wisconsin , and North Dakota that were found to place undue burden on minorities and other groups among voters . The states are required to offer alternatives for the November 2016 elections ; many of these cases are expected to reach the US Supreme Court for additional hearings .
