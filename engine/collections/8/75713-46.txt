Oliver Twist is born and raised into a life of poverty and misfortune in a workhouse in an unnamed town 70 miles north of London . Orphaned by his mother 's death in childbirth and his father 's mysterious absence , Oliver is meagrely provided for under the terms of the Poor Law and spends the first nine years of his life living at a baby farm in the ' care ' of a woman named Mrs Mann . Oliver is brought up with little food and few comforts . Around the time of Oliver 's ninth birthday , Mr Bumble , the parish beadle , removes Oliver from the baby farm and puts him to work picking and weaving oakum at the main workhouse . Oliver , who toils with very little food , remains in the workhouse six months . One day , the desperately hungry boys decide to draw lots ; the loser must ask for another portion of gruel . The task falls to Oliver , who at the next meal comes forward trembling , bowl in hand , and begs Mr Bumble for gruel with his famous request : `` Please , sir , I want some more '' .
