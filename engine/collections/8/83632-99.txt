In 1936 the Convention for the Suppression of the Illicit Traffic in Dangerous Drugs ( 1936 Trafficking Convention ) was concluded in Geneva . The U.S. , led by Anslinger , had attempted to include the criminalization of all activities in the treaty -- cultivation , production , manufacture and distribution -- related to the use of opium , coca ( and its derivatives ) , and cannabis , for non-medical and non-scientific purposes . Many countries opposed this and the focus remained on illicit trafficking . Article 2 of the Convention called upon signatory countries to use their national criminal law systems to `` severely '' punish , `` particularly by imprisonment or other penalties of deprivation of liberty '' , acts directly related to drug trafficking . The U.S. refused to sign the final version because it considered the convention too weak , especially in relation to extradition , extraterritoriality and the confiscation of trafficking profits .
