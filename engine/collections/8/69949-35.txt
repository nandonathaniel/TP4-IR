Bob 's Burgers is located in a green two - story building which features an apartment on the second floor where the Belcher family lives . The restaurant is sandwiched between two other commercial buildings , one of which houses `` It 's Your Funeral Home and Crematorium '' , whose owner Mort is a regular at the restaurant . One of the show 's running gags involves the other building , which is generally vacant during episodes but has been home to such businesses as `` Uncle Marty 's Breast Pumps '' , `` Extra Moist Yoga '' , `` That 's A-Door - A-Bell Doorbells '' , and `` Tire - Rhea '' .
