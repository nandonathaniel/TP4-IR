The botanical gardens of the modern tradition were established in northern Italy , the first being at Pisa ( 1544 ) , founded by Luca Ghini ( 1490 -- 1556 ) . Although part of a medical faculty , the first chair of materia medica , essentially a chair in botany , was established in Padua in 1533 . Then in 1534 , Ghini became Reader in materia medica at Bologna University , where Aldrovandi established a similar garden in 1568 ( see below ) . Collections of pressed and dried specimens were called a hortus siccus ( garden of dry plants ) and the first accumulation of plants in this way ( including the use of a plant press ) is attributed to Ghini . Buildings called herbaria housed these specimens mounted on card with descriptive labels . Stored in cupboards in systematic order they could be preserved in perpetuity and easily transferred or exchanged with other institutions , a taxonomic procedure that is still used today .
