In early 2010 , two journalists from the New York Times spent three months with soldiers and Marines in Afghanistan . While there , they questioned around 100 infantry troops about the reliability of their M16 rifles , as well as the M4 carbine . The troops did not report reliability problems with their rifles . While only 100 troops were asked , they engaged in daily fighting in Marja , including least a dozen intense engagements in Helmand Province , where the ground is covered in fine powdered sand ( called `` moon dust '' by troops ) that can stick to firearms . Weapons were often dusty , wet , and covered in mud . Intense firefights lasted hours with several magazines being expended . Only one soldier reported a jam when his M16 was covered in mud after climbing out of a canal . The weapon was cleared and resumed firing with the next chambered round . Furthermore , the Marine Chief Warrant Officer responsible for weapons training and performance of the Third Battalion , Sixth Marines , reported that `` We 've had nil in the way of problems ; we 've had no issues . '' with his battalion 's 350 M16s and 700 M4s .
