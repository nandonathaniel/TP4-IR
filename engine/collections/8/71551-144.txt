As regards the pronouns used to refer to animals , these generally agree in gender with the nouns denoting those animals , rather than the animals ' sex ( natural gender ) . In a language like English , which does not assign grammatical gender to nouns , the pronoun used for referring to objects ( it ) is often used for animals also . However , if the sex of the animal is known , and particularly in the case of companion animals , the gendered pronouns ( he and she ) may be used as they would be for a human .
