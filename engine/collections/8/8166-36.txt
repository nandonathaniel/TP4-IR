A few critics were less than impressed by King 's victory ; she was 26 years younger , and some experts claimed that it was more an age versus youth game . According to Jack Kramer , `` I do n't think Billie Jean played all that well . She hit a lot of short balls which Bobby could have taken advantage of had he been in shape . I would never take anything away from Billie Jean -- because she was smart enough to prepare herself properly -- but it might have been different if Riggs had n't kept running around . It was more than one woman who took care of Bobby Riggs in Houston . '' Before the match , however , King had forced the American television network ABC to drop Kramer as a commentator . King said , `` He does n't believe in women 's tennis . Why should he be part of this match ? He does n't believe in half of the match . I 'm not playing . Either he goes -- or I go . ''
