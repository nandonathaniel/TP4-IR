We are still interested in finding points where f ( \ displaystyle f ) does not change as we walk , since these points might be ( constrained ) extrema . We therefore seek x ( \ displaystyle \ mathbf ( x ) ) such that any allowable direction of movement away from x ( \ displaystyle \ mathbf ( x ) ) is perpendicular to ∇ f ( x ) ( \ displaystyle \ nabla f ( \ mathbf ( x ) ) ) ( otherwise we could increase f ( \ displaystyle f ) by moving along that allowable direction ) . In other words , ∇ f ( x ) ∈ A ⊥ = S ( \ displaystyle \ nabla f ( \ mathbf ( x ) ) \ in A ^ ( \ perp ) = S ) . Thus there are scalars λ , λ , ... , λ such that
