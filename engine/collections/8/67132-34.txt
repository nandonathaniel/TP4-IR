On Christmas Eve 1734 , the Alcázar was destroyed by a fire originating in the rooms of the French painter Jean Ranc . It was not detected quickly , due to the warning bells being confused with the call to mass . For fear of looting , the doors of the building remained closed , hampering rescue efforts . Many works of art were lost , such as the Expulsion of the Moors , by Diego Velázquez . Others , such as Las Meninas , were rescued by tossing them out the windows . Fortunately , many pieces were saved because the king ordered that much of his collection be moved to the Buen Retiro Palace shortly before the blaze . This fire lasted four days and completely destroyed the old Alcázar , whose last walls were finally demolished in 1738 .
