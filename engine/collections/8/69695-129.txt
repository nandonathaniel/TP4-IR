The nation 's Founding Fathers expected the Congress -- which was the first branch of government described in the Constitution -- to be the dominant branch of government ; they did not expect a strong executive department . However , presidential power has shifted over time , which has resulted in claims that the modern presidency has become too powerful , unchecked , unbalanced , and `` monarchist '' in nature . Critic Dana D. Nelson believes presidents over the past thirty years have worked towards `` undivided presidential control of the executive branch and its agencies '' . She criticizes proponents of the unitary executive for expanding `` the many existing uncheckable executive powers -- such as executive orders , decrees , memorandums , proclamations , national security directives and legislative signing statements -- that already allow presidents to enact a good deal of foreign and domestic policy without aid , interference or consent from Congress '' . Activist Bill Wilson opined that the expanded presidency was `` the greatest threat ever to individual freedom and democratic rule '' .
