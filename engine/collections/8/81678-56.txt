In a 2002 case brought by atheist Michael Newdow , whose daughter was being taught the Pledge in school , the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled the phrase `` under God '' an unconstitutional endorsement of monotheism when the Pledge was promoted in public school . In 2004 , the Supreme Court heard Elk Grove Unified School District v. Newdow , an appeal of the ruling , and rejected Newdow 's claim on the grounds that he was not the custodial parent , and therefore lacked standing , thus avoiding ruling on the merits of whether the phrase was constitutional in a school - sponsored recitation . On January 3 , 2005 , a new suit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of California on behalf of three unnamed families . On September 14 , 2005 , District Court Judge Lawrence Karlton ruled in their favor . Citing the precedent of the 2002 ruling by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals , Judge Karlton issued an Order stating that , upon proper motion , he would enjoin the school district defendants from continuing their practices of leading children in pledging allegiance to `` one Nation under God .
