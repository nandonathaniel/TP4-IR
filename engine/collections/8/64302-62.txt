The introduction of the first book of Kalila wa Demna is different than Panchatantra , in being more elaborate and instead of king and his three sons studying in the Indian version , the Persian version speaks of a merchant and his three sons who had squandered away their father 's wealth . The Persian version also makes an abrupt switch from the story of the three sons to an injured ox , and thereafter parallels the Panchatantra .
