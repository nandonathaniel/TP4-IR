Aristotle 's cosmology that placed the Earth at the center of a spherical hierarchic cosmos . The terrestrial and celestial regions were made up of different elements which had different kinds of natural movement . The terrestrial region , according to Aristotle , consisted of concentric spheres of the four elements -- earth , water , air , and fire . All bodies naturally moved in straight lines until they reached the sphere appropriate to their elemental composition -- their natural place . All other terrestrial motions were non-natural , or violent . The celestial region was made up of the fifth element , aether , which was unchanging and moved naturally with uniform circular motion . In the Aristotelian tradition , astronomical theories sought to explain the observed irregular motion of celestial objects through the combined effects of multiple uniform circular motions . The Ptolemaic model of planetary motion : based on the geometrical model of Eudoxus of Cnidus , Ptolemy 's Almagest , demonstrated that calculations could compute the exact positions of the Sun , Moon , stars , and planets in the future and in the past , and showed how these computational models were derived from astronomical observations . As such they formed the model for later astronomical developments . The physical basis for Ptolemaic models invoked layers of spherical shells , though the most complex models were inconsistent with this physical explanation .
