The combined effects of the disruption of the Russian Revolution , which decreased the supply of wheat and other commodity crops , and World War I increased agricultural prices ; this demand encouraged farmers to dramatically increase cultivation . For example , in the Llano Estacado of eastern New Mexico and northwestern Texas , the area of farmland was doubled between 1900 and 1920 , then tripled again between 1925 and 1930 . The agricultural methods favored by farmers during this period created the conditions for large - scale erosion under certain environmental conditions . The widespread conversion of the land by deep plowing and other soil preparation methods to enable agriculture eliminated the native grasses which held the soil in place and helped retain moisture during dry periods . Furthermore , cotton farmers left fields bare during winter months , when winds in the High Plains are highest , and burned the stubble as a means to control weeds prior to planting , thereby depriving the soil of organic nutrients and surface vegetation .
