The Spanish peninsular Muslims were suspected of connivance with Northern African Muslim pirates . Cardinal Francisco Jim√©nez de Cisneros was instrumental in a massive campaign to convert Muslims to Christianity . From 1502 , Ferdinand and later Phillip II forced all Muslims in Castile and Aragon to convert or be expelled . The nominally converted Christian Moriscos were later expelled from Spain between 1609 ( Valencia ) and 1614 ( Castile ) .
