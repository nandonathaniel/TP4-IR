The north coast is unusual in having four high tides each day , with a double high tide every twelve and a half hours . This arises because the western Solent is narrower than the eastern ; the initial tide of water flowing from the west starts to ebb before the stronger flow around the south of the island returns through the eastern Solent to create a second high water .
