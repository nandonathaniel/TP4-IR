In November 2017 , the California Chapter of the NAACP called on Congress to remove The Star - Spangled Banner as the national anthem . Alice Huffman , California NAACP president said : `` it 's racist ; it does n't represent our community , it 's anti-black . '' The third stanza of the anthem , which is rarely sung and few know , contains the words , `` No refuge could save the hireling and slave , From the terror of flight , or the gloom of the grave : '' , which some interpret as racist . The organization was still seeking a representative to sponsor the legislation in Congress at the time of their announcement .
