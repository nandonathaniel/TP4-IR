The series features simple production values and a stereotypical portrayal of working - class family life at the turn of the millennium . It therefore has something in common with kitchen sink drama . Almost all of the episodes take place in the Royles ' home , largely in the telly - centric living room , with the humour derived from the conversations held therein . Aherne and Cash co-wrote every episode , along with Henry Normal ( series one ) , Carmel Morgan ( series two ) , and Phil Mealey ( five Christmas specials ) . A sixth special episode was set to be written , but Aherne died on 2 July 2016 effectively ending the programme .
