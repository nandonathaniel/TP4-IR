The papillary muscles extend from the walls of the heart to valves by cartilaginous connections called chordae tendinae . These muscles prevent the valves from falling too far back when they close . During the relaxation phase of the cardiac cycle , the papillary muscles are also relaxed and the tension on the chordae tendineae is slight . As the heart chambers contract , so do the papillary muscles . This creates tension on the chordae tendineae , helping to hold the cusps of the atrioventricular valves in place and preventing them from being blown back into the atria .
