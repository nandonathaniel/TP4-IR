Unionized workers are sometimes required to cross the picket lines established by other unions due to their organizations having signed contracts which include no - strike clauses . The no - strike clause typically requires that members of the union not conduct any strike action for the duration of the contract ; such actions are called sympathy or secondary strikes . Members who honor the picket line in spite of the contract frequently face discipline , for their action may be viewed as a violation of provisions of the contract . Therefore , any union conducting a strike action typically seeks to include a provision of amnesty for all who honored the picket line in the agreement that settles the strike .
