The verses outside are engraved into the stone , in large legible letters . Above the doors are small engraved versions of the `` Greatest Name '' , one of several Bahá'í symbols and an elaborate decorative design that includes the letters ABHA , representing the prayer `` Alláh u Abhá '' ( God is Most Glorious ) in Arabic . It is the numerical value of these four letters in the words abha and baha ( for Bahá'u'lláh ) that add up to total nine , one of reasons Bahá'í Houses of Worship are nine - sided .
