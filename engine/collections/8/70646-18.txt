In the Talmud and the Jewish Kabbalah , the scholars agree that there are two types of spiritual places called `` Garden in Eden '' . The first is rather terrestrial , of abundant fertility and luxuriant vegetation , known as the `` lower Gan Eden '' . The second is envisioned as being celestial , the habitation of righteous , Jewish and non-Jewish , immortal souls , known as the `` higher Gan Eden '' . The Rabbanim differentiate between Gan and Eden . Adam is said to have dwelt only in the Gan , whereas Eden is said never to be witnessed by any mortal eye .
