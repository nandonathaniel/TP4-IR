From 26 -- 29 April 1994 , the South African population voted in the first universal suffrage general elections . The African National Congress won , well ahead of the governing National Party and the Inkatha Freedom Party . The Democratic Party and Pan Africanist Congress , among others , formed a parliamentary opposition in the country 's first non-racial parliament . Nelson Mandela was elected as President on 9 May 1994 and formed a Government of National Unity , consisting of the ANC , the National Party and Inkatha . On 10 May 1994 Mandela was inaugurated as South Africa 's new President in Pretoria with Thabo Mbeki and F.W. De Klerk as his vice-presidents . The Government of National Unity lapsed at the end of the first parliament sitting in 1999 , with the ANC becoming the sole party in power while maintaining a strategic alliance with the Congress of South African Trade Unions ( COSATU ) and the South African Communist Party . After considerable debate , and following submissions from advocacy groups , individuals and ordinary citizens , the Parliament enacted a new Constitution and Bill of Rights in 1996 . The death penalty was abolished , land reform and redistribution policies were introduced , and equitable labour laws legislated .
