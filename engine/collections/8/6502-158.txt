In June 2017 , Remini was upped to a series regular starting with Season 2 ; shortly after , it was announced that Erinn Hayes would not be returning for the show 's second season . Sources cited in a Variety article confirmed that Remini would be returning as Detective Vanessa Cellucci , the character she portrayed in the first - season finale , and that Hayes ' dismissal was for creative reasons and `` not a reflection '' of the actress ' performance . In August 2017 , it was reported Hayes ' character will be killed off before season two begins and the season will take place 7 -- 10 months after season one ended , in order to make room for Remini .
