For thousands of years , seawater pearls were retrieved by divers in the Indian Ocean in areas such as the Persian Gulf , the Red Sea and the Gulf of Mannar . Evidence also suggest a prehistoric origin to pearl diving in these regions . Starting in the Han Dynasty ( 206 BC -- 220 AD ) , the Chinese hunted extensively for seawater pearls in the South China Sea . In the 14th - century Arabian Sea , the traveller Ibn Battuta provided the earliest known description of pearl diving by means of attaching a cord to the diver 's waist .
