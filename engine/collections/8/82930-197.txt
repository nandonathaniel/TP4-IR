Believed to be a stowaway on a U.S. military transport near the end of World War II , the brown tree snake ( Boiga irregularis ) was accidentally introduced to Guam , which previously had no native species of snake . It nearly eliminated the native bird population . The problem was exacerbated because the snake has no natural predators on the island . The brown tree snake , known locally as the kulebla , is native to northern and eastern coasts of Australia , Papua New Guinea , and the Solomon Islands . It is slightly venomous , but relatively harmless to human beings ; it is nocturnal . Although some studies have suggested a high density of these serpents on Guam , residents rarely see them . The United States Department of Agriculture has trained detector dogs to keep the snakes out of the island 's cargo flow . The United States Geological Survey also has dogs that can detect snakes in forested environments around the region 's islands .
