Though the presence of U.S. draft evaders and deserters in Canada was initially controversial , the Canadian government eventually chose to welcome them . Draft evasion was not a criminal offense under Canadian law . The issue of deserters was more complex . Desertion from the U.S. military was not on the list of crimes for which a person could be extradited under the extradition treaty between Canada and the U.S. ; however , desertion was a crime in Canada , and the Canadian military strongly opposed condoning it . In the end , the Canadian government maintained the right to prosecute these deserters , but in practice left them alone and instructed border guards not to ask questions relating to the issue .
