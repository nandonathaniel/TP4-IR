According to the Commonwealth Treasury , immigration can reduce the average age of the Australian population : `` The level of net overseas migration is important : net inflows of migrants to Australia reduce the rate of population ageing because migrants are younger on average than the resident population . Currently , around 85 per cent of migrants are aged under 40 when they migrate to Australia , compared to around 55 per cent for the resident population . '' Ross Gittins , an economics columnist at Fairfax Media , has said that the Government 's focus on skilled migration has in fact reduced the average age of migrants . `` More than half are aged 15 to 34 , compared with 28 per cent of our population . Only 2 per cent of permanent immigrants are 65 or older , compared with 13 per cent of our population . '' Because of these statistics , Gittens claims that immigration is slowing the ageing of the Australian population and that the `` net benefit to the economy is a lot more clear - cut . ''
