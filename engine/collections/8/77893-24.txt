According to contemporary accounts , in February 1604 Catesby invited Thomas Wintour to his house in Lambeth , where they discussed Catesby 's plan to re-establish Catholicism in England by blowing up the House of Lords during the State Opening of Parliament . Wintour was known as a competent scholar , able to speak several languages , and he had fought with the English army in the Netherlands . His uncle , Francis Ingleby , had been executed for being a Catholic priest in 1586 , and Wintour later converted to Catholicism . Also present at the meeting was John Wright , a devout Catholic said to be one of the best swordsmen of his day , and a man who had taken part with Catesby in the Earl of Essex 's rebellion three years earlier . Despite his reservations over the possible repercussions should the attempt fail , Wintour agreed to join the conspiracy , perhaps persuaded by Catesby 's rhetoric : `` Let us give the attempt and where it faileth , pass no further .
