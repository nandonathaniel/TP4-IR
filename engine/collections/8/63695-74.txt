A penalty stroke is awarded when a defender commits a foul in the circle ( accidental or otherwise ) that prevents a probable goal or commits a deliberate foul in the circle or if defenders repeatedly run from the back line too early at a penalty corner . The penalty stroke is taken by a single attacker in the circle , against the goalkeeper , from a spot 6.4 m from goal . The ball is played only once at goal by the attacker using a push , flick or scoop stroke . If the shot is saved , play is restarted with a 15 m hit to the defenders . When a goal is scored , play is restarted in the normal way .
