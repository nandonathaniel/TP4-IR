The Italian Navy established a submarine base at Bordeaux , code named BETASOM , and thirty two Italian submarines participated in the Battle of the Atlantic . Plans to attack the harbour of New York City with CA class midget submarines in 1943 were disrupted when the submarine converted to carry out the attack , the Leonardo da Vinci , was sunk in May 1943 . The armistice put a stop to further planning .
