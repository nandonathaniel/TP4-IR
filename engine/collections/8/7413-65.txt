Parker chose Paul Williams to score the film in order to get a more `` palatable '' modern sound , and simply because he liked him . Williams had scored Brian De Palma 's commercial failure Phantom of the Paradise , but had also written huge pop - radio hits ( such as `` We 've Only Just Begun '' ( lyrics ) , and `` ( Just An ) Old Fashioned Love Song '' ) . In fact , Williams would soon win an Oscar for his song `` Evergreen '' from the film A Star Is Born ( 1976 ) .
