Ronald Melzack and Patrick Wall introduced their `` gate control '' theory of pain in the 1965 Science article `` Pain Mechanisms : A New Theory '' . The authors proposed that both thin ( pain ) and large diameter ( touch , pressure , vibration ) nerve fibers carry information from the site of injury to two destinations in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord : transmission cells that carry the pain signal up to the brain , and inhibitory interneurons that impede transmission cell activity . Activity in both thin and large diameter fibers excites transmission cells . Thin fiber activity impedes the inhibitory cells ( tending to allow the transmission cell to fire ) and large diameter fiber activity excites the inhibitory cells ( tending to inhibit transmission cell activity ) . So , the more large fiber ( touch , pressure , vibration ) activity relative to thin fiber activity at the inhibitory cell , the less pain is felt . The authors had drawn a neural `` circuit diagram '' to explain why we rub a smack . They pictured not only a signal traveling from the site of injury to the inhibitory and transmission cells and up the spinal cord to the brain , but also a signal traveling from the site of injury directly up the cord to the brain ( bypassing the inhibitory and transmission cells ) where , depending on the state of the brain , it may trigger a signal back down the spinal cord to modulate inhibitory cell activity ( and so pain intensity ) . The theory offered a physiological explanation for the previously observed effect of psychology on pain perception .
