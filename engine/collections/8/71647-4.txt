Danielle Reyes ( born January 22 , 1972 ) , 45 , was a media buyer from Fairfield , California . Danielle became a teenage mother while in high school , and later had another child . While in the house , Danielle had friendships with the majority of the cast . She became known for her Diary Room entries , in which she often made fun of her fellow HouseGuests . She also gained notability for the `` countdown '' , in which she would countdown the number of HouseGuests remaining until the Final Two . She had a secret alliance with Jason that was formed during the first week , in which the two would strategize while playing chess or cards . The secret alliance managed to get to the Final Three together uncaught , until Jason 's eviction on Day 78 . Danielle won the second Power of Veto of the season , and chose to leave Marcellas 's nominations intact that week . She went on to win the tenth Head of Household of the season , and nominated Amy and Lisa for eviction , resulting in Amy 's eviction . She managed to escape being nominated throughout the entire game , and was only technically nominated on Day 78 , when Lisa won the Final Head of Household competition and immediately had to choose to evict either Jason or Danielle ; she chose to evict Jason . On Day 82 , Danielle became Runner - up of Big Brother 3 in a nine to one vote , only receiving the vote of alliance member Jason . The jury vote was a source of controversy for fans of the series , who blamed Danielle 's Diary Room entries for her loss . Following this season , Big Brother 4 saw the evicted HouseGuests being sequestered until after the series finale , and they were not shown Diary Room sessions or private conversations . Danielle is seen as one of the great players to ever play the game by fans of the series .
