A Hail Mary pass , also known as a shot play , is a very long forward pass in American football , made in desperation , with only a small chance of success and time running out on the clock . The term became widespread after a December 28 , 1975 NFL playoff game between the Dallas Cowboys and the Minnesota Vikings , when Cowboys quarterback Roger Staubach ( a Roman Catholic and fan of The Godfather Part II ( 1974 ) , whose character Fredo had popularized the phrase ) said about his game - winning touchdown pass to wide receiver Drew Pearson , `` I closed my eyes and said a Hail Mary .
