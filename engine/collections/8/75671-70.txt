The dams also protected Egypt from the droughts in 1972 -- 73 and 1983 -- 87 that devastated East and West Africa . The High Dam allowed Egypt to reclaim about 2.0 million feddan ( 840,000 hectares ) in the Nile Delta and along the Nile Valley , increasing the country 's irrigated area by a third . The increase was brought about both by irrigating what used to be desert and by bringing under cultivation of 385,000 ha that were previously used as flood retention basins . About half a million families were settled on these new lands . In particular the area under rice and sugar cane cultivation increased . In addition , about 1 million feddan ( 420,000 hectares ) , mostly in Upper Egypt , were converted from flood irrigation with only one crop per year to perennial irrigation allowing two or more crops per year . On other previously irrigated land , yields increased because water could be made available at critical low - flow periods . For example , wheat yields in Egypt tripled between 1952 and 1991 and better availability of water contributed to this increase . Most of the 32 km of freshwater , or almost 40 percent of the average flow of the Nile that were previously lost to the sea every year could be put to beneficial use . While about 10 km of the water saved is lost due to evaporation in Lake Nasser , the amount of water available for irrigation still increased by 22 km . Other estimates put evaporation from Lake Nasser at between 10 and 16 cubic km per year .
