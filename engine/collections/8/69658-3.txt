As a rule of thumb , polysaccharides contain more than ten monosaccharide units , whereas oligosaccharides contain three to ten monosaccharide units ; but the precise cutoff varies somewhat according to convention . Polysaccharides are an important class of biological polymers . Their function in living organisms is usually either structure - or storage - related . Starch ( a polymer of glucose ) is used as a storage polysaccharide in plants , being found in the form of both amylose and the branched amylopectin . In animals , the structurally similar glucose polymer is the more densely branched glycogen , sometimes called `` animal starch '' . Glycogen 's properties allow it to be metabolized more quickly , which suits the active lives of moving animals .
