It has been argued that `` during the twentieth century two ' revolutions ' transformed rural Mexico : the Mexican Revolution ( 1910 -- 1920 ) and the Green Revolution ( 1950 -- 1970 ) '' . With the support of the Mexican government , the U.S. government , the United Nations , the Food and Agriculture Organization ( FAO ) , and the Rockefeller Foundation , Mexico made a concerted effort to transform agricultural productivity , particularly with irrigated rather than dry - land cultivation in its northwest , to solve its problem of lack of food self - sufficiency . In the center and south of Mexico , where large - scale production faced challenges , agricultural production languished . Increased production meant food self - sufficiency in Mexico to feed its growing and urbanizing population , with the number of calories consumed per Mexican increasing . Technology was seen as a valuable way to feed the poor , and would relieve some pressure of the land redistribution process .
