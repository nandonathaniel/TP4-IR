The Black Sea is a marginal sea and is the world 's largest body of water with a meromictic basin . The deep waters do not mix with the upper layers of water that receive oxygen from the atmosphere . As a result , over 90 % of the deeper Black Sea volume is anoxic water . The Black Sea 's circulation patterns are primarily controlled by basin topography and fluvial inputs , which result in a strongly stratified vertical structure . Because of the extreme stratification , it is classified as a salt wedge estuary .
