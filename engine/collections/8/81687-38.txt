The Peggs continued to record and release the Cropredy concerts as ' official bootlegs ' . These were supplemented by New Year 's gigs in minor locations including the Half Moon at Putney and the Gloucester Leisure Centre . In 1983 the magazine Fairport Fanatics ( later Dirty Linen ) , was created : a testament to the continued existence of a dedicated fan base .
