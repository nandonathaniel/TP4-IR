For reasons that remain unclear , no attempt was made to spike other allied guns while they were in French possession . In line with Wellington 's orders , gunners were able to return to their pieces and fire into the French cavalry as they withdrew after each attack . After numerous costly but fruitless attacks on the Mont - Saint - Jean ridge , the French cavalry was spent . Their casualties can not easily be estimated . Senior French cavalry officers , in particular the generals , experienced heavy losses . Four divisional commanders were wounded , nine brigadiers wounded , and one killed -- testament to their courage and their habit of leading from the front . Illustratively , Houssaye reports that the Grenadiers Ã  Cheval numbered 796 of all ranks on 15 June , but just 462 on 19 June , while the Empress Dragoons lost 416 of 816 over the same period . Overall Guyot 's Guard heavy cavalry division lost 47 % of its strength .
