These shorts were used to promote the film . They have all been released on the official Jimmy Neutron : Boy Genius DVD release of the film . All of the inventions in each short were seen again at some point on the television series ( except for the Pain - Transference helmet ) . Clips from similar versions of these shorts , along with clips from the unaired `` Runaway Rocketboy '' pilot , appeared in the teaser trailer for Jimmy Neutron : Boy Genius . The biggest difference between the clips seen in the trailer and the original shorts is that Jimmy wears the white and red striped shirt he wore in the pilot , rather than his trademark shirt .
