According to historian Simon Anglim , the rebel groups were divided into general categories : mujahadeen and fedayeen . The former were guerrillas who engaged in armed confrontations , while the latter committed acts of sabotage . According to later accounts of some surviving rebel leaders from the Galilee , the mujahideen maintained little coordination with the nominal hierarchy of the revolt . Most ambushes were the result of a local initiative undertaken by a qa'id or a group of quwwa'id from the same area .
