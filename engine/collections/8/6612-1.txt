Under the central route , persuasion will likely result from a person 's careful and thoughtful consideration of the true merits of the information presented in support of an advocacy . The central route involves a high level of message elaboration in which a great amount of cognition about the arguments are generated by the individual receiving the message . The results of attitude change will be relatively enduring , resistant , and predictive of behavior . On the other hand , under the peripheral route , persuasion results from a person 's association with positive or negative cues in the stimulus or making a simple inference about the merits of the advocated position . The cues received by the individual under the peripheral route are generally unrelated to the logical quality of the stimulus . These cues will involve factors such as the credibility or attractiveness of the sources of the message , or the production quality of the message . The likelihood of elaboration will be determined by an individual 's motivation and ability to evaluate the argument being presented .
