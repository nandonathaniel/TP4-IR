Needle tatting originated in the early twentieth century , but did not become popular until much later . A tatting needle is a long , blunt needle that does not change thickness at the eye of the needle . The needle used must match the thickness of the thread chosen for the project . Rather than winding the shuttle , the needle is threaded with a length of thread . To work with a second color , a second needle is used . Although needle tatting looks similar to shuttle tatting , it differs in structure and is slightly thicker and looser because both the needle and the thread must pass through the stitches . However , it may be seen that the Victorian tatting pin would function as a tatting needle . As well , Florence Hartley refers in The Ladies ' Hand Book of Fancy and Ornamental Work ( 1859 ) to the use of the tatting needle , so it must have originated prior to the mid-1800s .
