The franchise adopted its brand name Golden State Warriors prior to the 1971 -- 72 season , in order to suggest that the team represented the entire state of California . Almost all home games were played in Oakland that season ; six were played in San Diego , but none in San Francisco or Daly City . Oakland Arena became the team 's exclusive home court in 1971 .
