In his book Reflections on the Revolution in Europe , Ralf Dahrendorf asserts that , due to advanced level of competence required for political activity , a political party tends to become , actually , a provider of `` political services '' , that is , the administration of local and governmental public offices . During the electoral campaign , each party tries to convince voters it is the most suitable for managing the state business . The logical consequence would be to acknowledge this character and openly register the parties as service providing companies . In this way , the ruling class would include the members and associates of legally acknowledged companies and the `` class that is ruled '' would select by election the state administration company that best fits its interests .
