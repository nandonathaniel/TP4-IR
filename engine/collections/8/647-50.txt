Professor Eobard Thawne is introduced on The Flash as a scientist from the future who duplicated the reaction that gave Barry Allen / The Flash his powers and became the hero 's archenemy , the Reverse - Flash . Eobard traveled back in time to the year 2000 to kill his nemesis as a child . When the 2024 Flash intervened , the Reverse - Flash murdered Barry 's mother and framed his father instead , thus erasing this Flash from existence while unintentionally severing his own connection to the Speed Force , leaving him stranded in the 21st Century . Knowing that Dr. Harrison Wells would be responsible for creating metahumans in 2020 , Eobard killed the scientist and assumed his identity . He then founded S.T.A.R. Labs and created a particle accelerator to turn Barry into the Flash and regain his own link to the Speed Force . Faking paralysis , `` Dr. Wells '' pushes Barry to run faster in hopes of using the latter 's pure Speed Force connection to travel back to his time . After Eobard 's secret is discovered , he is defeated by the Flash , the Arrow and Firestorm . Eobard then offers Barry a chance to travel back in time to save his mother in exchange for a time sphere to return to the future , but Barry ultimately chooses not to do so and returns to destroy Eobard 's machine . As the Reverse - Flash prepares to kill the Flash , his ancestor Detective Eddie Thawne kills himself and seemingly erases Eobard from existence . A year later , Barry temporarily creates a new reality and restores a time remnant of Eobard to the timeline in the process .
