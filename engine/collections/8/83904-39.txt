The approach to improvisation has developed enormously over the history of the music . In early New Orleans and Dixieland jazz , performers took turns playing the melody , while others improvised countermelodies . By the swing era , big bands were coming to rely more on arranged music : arrangements were either written or learned by ear and memorized , while individual soloists would improvise within these arrangements . Later , in bebop , the focus shifted back toward small groups and minimal arrangements ; the melody would be stated briefly at the start and end of a piece , but the core of the performance would be the series of improvisations . Subsequent styles such as modal jazz abandoned the strict notion of a chord progression , allowing the individual musicians to improvise even more freely within the context of a given scale or mode . In many forms of jazz , a soloist is often supported by a rhythm section consisting of one or more chordal instruments ( piano , guitar , etc . ) , double bass playing the basslines and drum kit . These performers provide accompaniment by playing chords and rhythms that outline the song structure and complement the soloist . In avant - garde and free jazz idioms , the separation of soloist and band is reduced , and there is license , or even a requirement , for the abandoning of chords , scales and rhythmic meters .
