Tris McCall of The Star - Ledger describes `` The Fox '' as `` a parody of the excesses and absurdities of contemporary club music '' : the brothers `` take turns singing preposterous lyrics about animal noises '' over `` typically vainglorious synthpop '' , with the proposed fox sounds `` mimic ( king ) the car - alarm synthesizers of contemporary dubstep '' . He compares it to Ylvis ' `` Someone Like Me '' which mocked the insertion of dubstep breaks into pop songs . Danielle Seamon of The Lantern acknowledges that while some may be `` extremely perplexed by the attention stupidity and bizarreness collects in 2013 '' displayed by the song , it is in fact `` meant to be a funny and almost satirical to pop music '' , and Ylvis has `` pushed everybody 's buttons by breaking and manipulating every rule of a Top 40 pop song '' . Evan Sawdey of PopMatters , who names `` The Fox '' one of the best songs of the year , calls it `` a concept that 's so stupid it 's smart '' by bending `` the very fabric of pop culture in such a memorable , ridiculous way '' with simple lines of `` utter comic brilliance '' .
