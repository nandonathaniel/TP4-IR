United States President Theodore Roosevelt sought to prevent European intervention , largely to protect the routes to the future Panama Canal , as the canal was already under construction . He made a small military intervention to ward off European powers , to proclaim his famous Roosevelt Corollary to the Monroe Doctrine , and also to obtain his 1905 Dominican agreement for U.S. administration of Dominican customs , which was the chief source of income for the Dominican government . A 1906 agreement provided for the arrangement to last 50 years . The United States agreed to use part of the customs proceeds to reduce the immense foreign debt of the Dominican Republic and assumed responsibility for said debt .
