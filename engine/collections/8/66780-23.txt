HA is a bulky , negatively charged glycosaminoglycan , whose strong affinity with water procures HA its viscoelastic and shock absorbing properties essential to vocal biomechanics . Viscosity and elasticity are critical to voice production . Chan , Gray and Titze , quantified the effect of HA on both the viscosity and the elasticity of vocal folds ( VF ) by comparing the properties of tissues with and without HA . The results showed that removal of HA decreased the stiffness of VF by an average of 35 % , but increased their dynamic viscosity by an average of 70 % at frequencies higher than 1 Hz . Newborns have been shown to cry an average of 6.7 hours per day during the first 3 months , with a sustained pitch of 400 -- 600 Hz , and a mean duration per day of 2 hours . Similar treatment on adult VF would quickly result in edema , and subsequently aphonia . Schweinfurth and al. presented the hypothesis that high hyaluronic acid content and distribution in newborn VF is directly associated with newborn crying endurance . These differences in newborn vocal fold composition would also be responsible for newborns inability to articulate sounds , besides the fact that their lamina propria is a uniform structure with no vocal ligament . The layered structure necessary for phonation will start to develop during the infancy and until the adolescence .
