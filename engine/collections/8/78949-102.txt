I used to listen to Gertrude Lawrence on the public address system every night in our dressing rooms , and she 'd get onto a note and sag down off of it . The night after I left the show to go into Paint Your Wagon , Yul Brynner gave me house seats and I saw her from the front and I was so taken by her . She had such a star quality , you did n't care if she sang off - key . She more than dominated the stage . Boy , was that a lesson to me .
