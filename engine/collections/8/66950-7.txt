In the early 18th century , comic operas often appeared as short , one - act interludes known as intermezzi that were performed in between acts of opera seria . There also existed , however , self - contained operatic comedies . La serva padrona ( 1733 ) by Giovanni Battista Pergolesi ( 1710 -- 1736 ) , is the one intermezzo still performed with any regularity today , and provides an excellent example of the style . Lo frate ' nnamorato ( 1732 ) and Il Flaminio ( 1735 ) , by Pergolesi as well , are examples of the three - act commedia per musica .
