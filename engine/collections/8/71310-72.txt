A full or 100 % - reserve gold standard exists when the monetary authority holds sufficient gold to convert all the circulating representative money into gold at the promised exchange rate . It is sometimes referred to as the gold specie standard to more easily distinguish it . Opponents of a full standard consider it difficult to implement , saying that the quantity of gold in the world is too small to sustain worldwide economic activity at or near current gold prices ; implementation would entail a many-fold increase in the price of gold . Gold standard proponents have said , `` Once a money is established , any stock of money becomes compatible with any amount of employment and real income . '' While prices would necessarily adjust to the supply of gold , the process may involve considerable economic disruption , as was experienced during earlier attempts to maintain gold standards .
