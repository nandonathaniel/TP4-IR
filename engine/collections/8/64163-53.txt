According to Edward Bishop Elliott 's interpretation , that the Four Horsemen represent a prophecy of the subsequent history of the Roman Empire , the white color of this horse signifies triumph , prosperity and health in the political Roman body . For the next 80 or 90 years succeeding the banishment of the apostle John to Patmos covering the successive reigns of the emperors Nerva , Trajan , Hadrian and the two Antonines ( Antoninus Pius and Marcus Aurelius ) , a golden age of prosperity , union , civil liberty and good government unstained with civil blood unfolded . The agents of this prosperity personified by the rider of the white horse are these five emperors wearing crowns that reigned with absolute authority and power under the guidance of virtue and wisdom , the armies being restrained by their firm and gentle hands .
