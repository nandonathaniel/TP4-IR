Driving or hiking to the summit of Cadillac Mountain to see `` the nation 's first sunrise '' is a popular activity among visitors of Acadia National Park . However , Cadillac only sees the first sunrise in the fall and winter , when the sun rises south of due east . During most of the spring and summer , the sun rises first on Mars Hill , 150 miles ( 240 km ) to the northeast . For a few weeks around the equinoxes , the sun rises first at West Quoddy Head in Lubec , Maine .
