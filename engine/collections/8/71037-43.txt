William found a stable parsonage at the St. Thomas A.M.E. Zion in 1910 , where Robeson would fill in for his father during sermons when he was called away . In 1912 , Robeson attended Somerville High School in Somerville , New Jersey , where he performed in Julius Caesar and Othello , sang in the chorus , and excelled in football , basketball , baseball and track . His athletic dominance elicited racial taunts which he ignored . Prior to his graduation , he won a statewide academic contest for a scholarship to Rutgers . He took a summer job as a waiter in Narragansett Pier , Rhode Island , where he befriended Fritz Pollard , later to be the first African - American coach in the National Football League .
