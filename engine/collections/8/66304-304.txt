WQUXGA is the maximum resolution supported by DisplayPort 1.2 , though actually displaying such a resolution on a device with DisplayPort 1.2 is dependent on the graphics system in much the same way devices with VGA connectors do not necessarily maximize that standard 's highest possible resolution . Most display cards with a DVI connector are capable of supporting the 3840 Ã— 2400 resolution . However , the maximum refresh rate will be limited by the number of DVI links which are connected to the monitor . 1 , 2 , or 4 DVI connectors are used to drive the monitor using various tile configurations . Only the IBM T221 - DG5 and IDTech MD22292B5 support the use of dual - link DVI ports through an external converter box . Many systems using these monitors use at least two DVI connectors to send video to the monitor . These DVI connectors can be from the same graphics card , different graphics cards , or even different computers . Motion across the tile boundary ( ies ) can show tearing if the DVI links are not synchronized . The display panel can be updated at a speed between 0 Hz and 41 Hz ( 48 Hz for the IBM T221 - DG5 , - DGP , and IDTech MD22292B5 ) . The refresh rate of the video signal can be higher than 41 Hz ( or 48 Hz ) but the monitor will not update the display any faster even if graphics card ( s ) do so .
