Insertion on internal nodes is slightly more complex than on leaf nodes . Say that the internal node is node A and that node B is the child of A. ( If the insertion is to insert a right child , then B is the right child of A , and similarly with a left child insertion . ) A assigns its child to the new node and the new node assigns its parent to A. Then the new node assigns its child to B and B assigns its parent as the new node .
