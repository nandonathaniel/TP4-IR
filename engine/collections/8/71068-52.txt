Microcode programs control some central processing units and some other hardware . This code moves data between the registers , buses , arithmetic logic units , and other functional units in the CPU . Unlike conventional programs , microcode is not usually written by , or even visible to , the end users of systems , and is usually provided by the manufacturer , and is considered internal to the device .
