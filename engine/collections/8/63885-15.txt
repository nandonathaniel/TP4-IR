The colony was separated into the Province of South Carolina and the Province of North Carolina in 1712 . South Carolina 's capital city of Charleston became a major port for traffic on the Atlantic Ocean , and South Carolina developed indigo , rice and Sea Island cotton as commodity crop exports , making it one of the most prosperous of the colonies . A strong colonial government fought wars with the local Indians , and with Spanish imperial outposts in Florida , while fending off the threat of pirates . Birth rates were high , food was abundant , and these offset the disease environment of malaria to produce rapid population growth among whites . With the expansion of plantation agriculture , the colony imported numerous African slaves , who comprised a majority of the population by 1708 . They were integral to its development .
