`` And there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field , keeping watch over their flock by night . And , lo , the angel of the Lord came upon them , and the glory of the Lord shone round about them : and they were sore afraid . And the angel said unto them , Fear not ; for , behold , I bring you tidings of great joy , which shall be to all people . For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Savior , which is Christ the Lord . And this shall be a sign unto you : Ye shall find the babe wrapped in swaddling clothes , lying in a manger . And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God , and saying , Glory to God in the highest , and on earth peace and goodwill towards men . ''
