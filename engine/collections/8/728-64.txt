Until 1971 , the Postmaster General , the head of the Post Office Department , was a member of the Cabinet , initially the last in the presidential line of succession before new officers were added . Once the Post Office Department was re-organized into the United States Postal Service , a special agency independent of the executive branch , the Postmaster General ceased to be a member of the Cabinet and was thus removed from the line of succession .
