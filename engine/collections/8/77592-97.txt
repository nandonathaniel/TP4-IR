In August 2003 , Governor Mike Foster announced speed and lane restrictions on trucks on the 18 mile ( 29 km ) stretch of Interstate 10 known as the Atchafalaya Swamp Freeway . The restrictions lower the truck speed limit to 55 mph and restrict them to the right lane for the entire length of the elevated freeway .
