Little evidence has been found of iron production after the Romans left until the ninth century , when a primitive bloomery , of a continental style , was built at Millbrook on Ashdown Forest , with a small hearth for reheating the blooms nearby . Production based on bloomeries then continued till the end of the 15th century , when a new technique was imported from northern France that allowed the production of cast iron . A permanent blast furnace was constructed ; into the furnace chamber was inserted a pipe fed by bellows that could be operated by a wheel ; the wheel was rotated by the use of water power , oxen or horses . Pairs of bellows continuously forced air into the furnace chamber , producing higher temperatures such that the iron completely melted and could be run off from the base of the chamber and into moulds . This allowed a continuous process that usually ran during the winter and spring seasons , ceasing when water supplies to drive the bellows dwindled in the summer .
