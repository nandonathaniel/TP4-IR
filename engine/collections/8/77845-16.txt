Upon arrival at the Louvre , the statue was reassembled , but the fragments of the left hand and arm were dismissed initially as being a later restoration because of the rougher workmanship . It now is accepted that the left hand holding the apple and the left arm are in fact original to the statue , but were not so well finished as the rest of the statue since they would have been somewhat above visible level and difficult to see . This was a standard practice for many sculptors of the era -- less visible parts of statues often were not so well finished since typically , they would be invisible to the casual observer . Sculptures and statues from this era normally were carved out of several blocks of stone and carefully pieced together . The Venus de Milo was found to have been carved from at least six or seven blocks of Parian marble : one block for the nude torso , another for the draped legs , one for each arm , a small block for the right foot , a block for the inscribed plinth , and the separately carved herm that stood beside the statue .
