The writers were new to screenwriting , so their film treatment ran to 110 - pages ; the average was 15 pages . Reitman and Simmons pitched it to various Hollywood studios . Simmons met with Ned Tanen , an executive at Universal Studios . He was encouraged by younger executives Sean Daniel and Thom Mount who were more receptive to the Lampoon type of humor ; Mount had discovered the `` Seven Fires '' film treatment as Tanen 's assistant , while investigating projects left by a fired studio executive . Tanen hated the idea . Ramis remembers , `` We went further than I think Universal expected or wanted . I think they were shocked and appalled . Chris ' fraternity had virtually been a vomiting cult . And we had a lot of scenes that were almost orgies of vomit ... We did n't back off anything '' . As the writers created more drafts of the screenplay ( nine in total ) , the studio gradually became more receptive to the project , especially Mount , who championed it . The studio green - lighted the film and set the budget at a modest $3 million . Simmons remembers , `` They just figured , ' Screw it , it 's a silly little movie , and we 'll make a couple of bucks if we 're lucky -- let them do whatever they want . ' ''
