The R series are built around a horizontally opposed flat - twin ( boxer ) engine . As the engine is mounted with a longitudinal crankshaft , the cylinder heads protrude well beyond the sides of the frame . Originally , R series bikes had air - cooled heads but are now produced only with partial oil cooling or water cooling . The type of internal combustion engine cooling used across the various R series engines leads to the use of the distinguishing names airhead and oilhead .
