The calculus controversy ( often referred to with the German term Priorit√§tsstreit , meaning `` priority dispute '' ) was an argument between 17th - century mathematicians Isaac Newton and Gottfried Leibniz ( begun or fomented in part by their disciples and associates ) over who had first invented the mathematical study of change , calculus . It is a question that had been the cause of a major intellectual controversy , one that began simmering in 1699 and broke out in full force in 1711 .
