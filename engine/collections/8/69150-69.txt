After putting out a call for volunteers in June 2015 , over 450 volunteers helped to make the Super Bowl 50 Tour happen . More than 5,000 volunteers were on hand to help with events leading up to , during and after Super Bowl 50 as well . Volunteers signed up for a minimum of 3 -- 4 hour shifts , and some volunteers gave more than 200 hours of their time over the course of the week . As a thank you for volunteering , volunteers were gifted backpacks and uniforms .
