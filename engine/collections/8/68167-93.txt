A fixed wing is typically unstable in pitch , roll , and yaw . Pitch and yaw stabilities of conventional fixed wing designs require horizontal and vertical stabilisers , which act similarly to the feathers on an arrow . These stabilizing surfaces allow equilibrium of aerodynamic forces and to stabilise the flight dynamics of pitch and yaw . They are usually mounted on the tail section ( empennage ) , although in the canard layout , the main aft wing replaces the canard foreplane as pitch stabilizer . Tandem wing and Tailless aircraft rely on the same general rule to achieve stability , the aft surface being the stabilising one .
