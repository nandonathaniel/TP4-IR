Chelsea have only had one home ground , Stamford Bridge , where they have played since the team 's foundation . It was officially opened on 28 April 1877 and for the first 28 years of its existence it was used almost exclusively by the London Athletic Club as an arena for athletics meetings and not at all for football . In 1904 the ground was acquired by businessman Gus Mears and his brother Joseph , who had also purchased nearby land ( formerly a large market garden ) with the aim of staging football matches on the now 12.5 acre ( 51,000 m2 ) site . Stamford Bridge was designed for the Mears family by the noted football architect Archibald Leitch , who had also designed Ibrox , Craven Cottage and Hampden Park . Most football clubs were founded first , and then sought grounds in which to play , but Chelsea were founded for Stamford Bridge .
