Every current justice has an Ivy League background . Four justices are from the state of New York , one is from California , one is from New Jersey , one is from Georgia , one is from Colorado , and one is from Maryland . In the 19th century , every justice was a man of European descent ( usually Northern European ) , and almost always Protestant . Diversity concerns focused on geography , to represent all regions of the country , rather than religious , ethnic , or gender diversity .
