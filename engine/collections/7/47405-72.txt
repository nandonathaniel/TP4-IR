Steven Rea of The Philadelphia Inquirer gave the film a score of 3 out of 4 ; he said : `` Woodley ... balances grace with gravity , wit with heart . '' A.O. Scott writing for The New York Times said : `` The film sets out to make you weep -- not just sniffle or choke up a little , but sob until your nose runs and your face turns blotchy . It succeeds . '' The Boston Globe 's Ty Burr gave the film a rating of 2.5 out 4 and said : `` If Elgort 's Gus is glibly charming and ultimately affecting , The Fault in Our Stars belongs to Woodley , a performer who always seems to be backing warily into her own movies .
