Carprofen , and other anti-inflammatories in general , whilst very safe for most animals , can sometimes cause problems for some animals , and ( in a few rare cases ) sudden death through liver toxicity . This is most commonly discussed with carprofen but may be equally relevant with other anti-inflammatories . As a result , it is often recommended to perform monthly ( or at least , twice - annually ) blood tests to confirm that the animal is not reacting adversely to the medications . Such side effects are rare but worth being aware of , especially if long - term use is anticipated .
