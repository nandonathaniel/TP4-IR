On 7 October 2009 , the presence of water ice was confirmed on the surface of 24 Themis using NASA 's Infrared Telescope Facility . The surface of the asteroid appears completely covered in ice . As this ice layer is sublimated , it may be getting replenished by a reservoir of ice under the surface . Organic compounds were also detected on the surface . Scientists hypothesize that some of the first water brought to Earth was delivered by asteroid impacts after the collision that produced the Moon . The presence of ice on 24 Themis supports this theory .
