Although the moths are cryptically camouflaged and rest during the day in unexposed positions on trees , they are predated by birds hunting by sight . The original camouflage ( or crypsis ) seems near - perfect against a background of lichen growing on trees . The sudden growth of industrial pollution in the nineteenth century changed the effectiveness of the moths ' camouflage : the trees became blackened by soot , and the lichen died off . In 1848 a dark version of this moth was found in the Manchester area . By 1895 98 % of the peppered moths in this area were black . This was a rapid change for a species that has only one generation a year .
