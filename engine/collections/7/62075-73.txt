The film had its opening premiere on March 2 , 1965 at the Rivoli Theater in New York City . Initial reviews were mixed . Bosley Crowther , in The New York Times , criticized the film 's `` romantic nonsense and sentiment '' , the children 's `` artificial roles '' , and Robert Wise 's `` cosy - cum - corny '' direction . Judith Crist , in a biting review in the New York Herald Tribune , dismissed the movie as `` icky sticky '' and designed for `` the five to seven set and their mommies '' . In her review for McCall 's magazine , Pauline Kael called the film `` the sugar - coated lie people seem to want to eat '' , and that audiences have `` turned into emotional and aesthetic imbeciles when we hear ourselves humming the sickly , goody - goody songs '' . Wise later recalled , `` The East Coast , intellectual papers and magazines destroyed us , but the local papers and the trades gave us great reviews '' . Indeed , reviewers such as Philip K. Scheuer of the Los Angeles Times described the film as `` three hours of visual and vocal brilliance '' , and Variety called it `` a warmly - pulsating , captivating drama set to the most imaginative use of the lilting R-H tunes , magnificently mounted and with a brilliant cast '' . The `` wildly mixed film reviews '' reflected the critical response to the stage musical , according to The Oxford Companion to the American Musical . After its Los Angeles premiere on March 10 , The Sound of Music opened in 131 theaters in the United States , including a limited number of roadshow events . After four weeks , the film became the number one box office movie in the country , and held that position for thirty out of the next forty - three weeks in 1965 . The original theatrical release of the film in America lasted four and a half years .
