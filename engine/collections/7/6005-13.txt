The brand derives its name from the fact that the original brewery , which was established in 1857 by LÃ¼der Rutenberg , was located next to the former St. Paul 's Friary ( de ) in Bremen . There are currently three brands of beer brewed : St. Pauli Girl Lager , St. Pauli Girl Special Dark and St. Pauli Non-Alcoholic Malt Beverage . The beer is only produced for export and is not sold in Germany .
