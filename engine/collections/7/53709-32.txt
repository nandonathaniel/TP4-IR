The new NCAA rule was passed in response to the end of the 4th quarter in the 2010 Music City Bowl . In that game , the North Carolina Tar Heels were down 20 - 17 at the end of the 4th quarter and because they had no timeouts , they spiked the ball to stop the clock with 1 second left while too many men were on the field due to confusion about whether the field goal unit needed to come on the field . Because college football did not yet have the 10 - second runoff , UNC was penalized 5 yards but was still able to kick the field goal to send the game to overtime , and would wind up beating Tennessee 30 - 27 in double overtime . Ironically , the new rule would not have saved Tennessee , because the Tar Heels ' foul came after the snap , which would not have triggered the runoff .
