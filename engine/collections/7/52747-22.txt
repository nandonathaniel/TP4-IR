Messages of support poured into the Assembly from Paris and other French cities . On 9 July 1789 , the Assembly , reconstituting itself as the National Constituent Assembly , addressed the king in polite but firm terms , requesting the removal of the troops ( which now included foreign regiments , who showed far greater obedience to the king than did his French troops ) , but Louis declared that he alone could judge the need for troops , and assured them that the troops had deployed strictly as a precautionary measure . Louis `` offered '' to move the assembly to Noyon or Soissons : that is to say , to place it between two armies and deprive it of the support of the Parisian people . Public outrage over this troop presence precipitated the Storming of the Bastille , beginning the Revolution .
