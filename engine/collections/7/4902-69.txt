With the complexities of ownership unresolved , none of the grand Baroque schemes could be realised for a City of piazzas and avenues ; there was nobody to negotiate with , and no means of calculating how much compensation should be paid . Instead , much of the old street plan was recreated in the new City , with improvements in hygiene and fire safety : wider streets , open and accessible wharves along the length of the Thames , with no houses obstructing access to the river , and , most importantly , buildings constructed of brick and stone , not wood . New public buildings were created on their predecessors ' sites ; perhaps the most famous is St Paul 's Cathedral and its smaller cousins , Christopher Wren 's 50 new churches .
