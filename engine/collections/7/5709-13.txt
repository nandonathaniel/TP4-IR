The New Croton Aqueduct , completed in 1890 , brings water from the New Croton Reservoir in Westchester and Putnam counties . The Catskill Aqueduct , completed in 1916 , is significantly larger than New Croton and brings water from two reservoirs in the eastern Catskill Mountains . The Delaware Aqueduct , completed in 1945 , taps tributaries of the Delaware River in the western Catskill Mountains and provides approximately half of New York City 's water supply .
