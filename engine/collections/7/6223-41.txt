Section 1 is a vesting clause that bestows federal legislative power exclusively to Congress . Similar clauses are found in Articles II and III . The former confers executive power upon the President alone , and the latter grants judicial power solely to the federal judiciary . These three articles create a separation of powers among the three branches of the federal government . This separation of powers , by which each department may exercise only its own constitutional powers and no others , is fundamental to the idea of a limited government accountable to the people .
