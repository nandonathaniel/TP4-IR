In meteorological terms , the summer solstice and winter solstice ( or the maximum and minimum insolation , respectively ) do not fall in the middles of summer and winter . The heights of these seasons occur up to seven weeks later because of seasonal lag . Seasons , though , are not always defined in meteorological terms .
