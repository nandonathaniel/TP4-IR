Fishing fleet monitoring and control AIS is widely used by national authorities to track and monitor the activities of their national fishing fleets . AIS enables authorities to reliably and cost effectively monitor fishing vessel activities along their coast line , typically out to a range of 100 km ( 60 mi ) , depending on location and quality of coast based receivers / base stations with supplementary data from satellite based networks .
