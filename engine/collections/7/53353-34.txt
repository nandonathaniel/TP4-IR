Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey is a new attraction inside the replica of Hogwarts Castle , simulating a tour of the castle and its surrounding grounds . Visitors initially walk through the castle , interacting with various characters and props from the Potter series , including a speech from Dumbledore , and directions from Harry , Hermione and Ron , before boarding a `` magical bench '' ( controlled with a KUKA robotic arm system ) . Throughout the ride , guests are taken around the outside of the castle , using a combination of simulated flight as well as encountering realistic animatronic versions of the Whomping Willow , a horde of dementors , giant spiders , the Hungarian Horntail Dragon , and a Quidditch match .
