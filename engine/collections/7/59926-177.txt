General Ursus is interested mainly in his own dreams of conquest , glory and power . At a meeting of the ape council , Ursus uses the recent crop failures , drought , and raids by wild humans as the basis for a call to invade the Forbidden Zone , where few apes have ventured since the beginning of their world . Suggesting that another tribe of humans lives there ( a belief based on Dr. Zaius ' encounter with Taylor in the previous film ) , and the disappearances of gorilla scouts sent into the zone to investigate , Ursus stirs the apes up to invade , and claim their food source for themselves .
