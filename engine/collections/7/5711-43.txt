Relying solely on private donations , Sagrada Familia 's construction progressed slowly and was interrupted by the Spanish Civil War , only to resume intermittent progress in the 1950s . Since commencing construction in 1882 , advancements in technologies such as computer aided design and computerised numerical control ( CNC ) have enabled faster progress and construction passed the midpoint in 2010 . However , some of the project 's greatest challenges remain , including the construction of ten more spires , each symbolising an important Biblical figure in the New Testament . It is anticipated that the building could be completed by 2026 -- the centenary of Gaud√≠ 's death .
