The current National League club was founded in 1969 as the Montreal Expos , part of the MLB expansion , which included the Seattle Pilots ( now the Milwaukee Brewers ) , Kansas City Royals , and San Diego Padres . Based in Montreal , the Expos were the first Major League team in Canada . Home games were played at Jarry Park Stadium and later in Olympic Stadium . During the strike - shortened 1981 season , the Expos won a division championship and made their only post-season appearance in Montreal , defeating the Philadelphia Phillies , 3 -- 2 , in the National League Division Series , but losing to the Los Angeles Dodgers , 3 -- 2 , in the National League Championship Series .
