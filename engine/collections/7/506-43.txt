ACC Sixth Man of the Year De'Andre Hunter broke his wrist in the ACC Tournament victory , and was announced to be out for the NCAA Tournament two days before it began . The injury led the New York Daily News to change their pick from Virginia winning the national championship to not advancing out of the Sweet Sixteen . UVA entered as the No. 1 overall seed , placed in the South regional , but suffered a historic upset in the first round to UMBC and became the first No. 1 seed to lose to a No. 16 seed since the field expanded to 64 teams in 1985 . The first round losses by No. 1 seed Virginia and No. 4 seed Arizona , and second round losses by No. 2 seed Cincinnati and No. 3 seed Tennessee , led to the South Region becoming the first ever to not advance any of its top four seeds to the Sweet Sixteen .
