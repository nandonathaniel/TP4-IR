The threat to Orléans had prompted the partisans of Richemont and La Trémoille to make a quick temporary truce in October 1428 . In early 1429 , Charles de Bourbon ( Count of Clermont ) assembled a French - Scottish force in Blois for the relief of Orléans . Hearing of the dispatch of an English supply convoy from Paris , under the command of Sir John Fastolf for the English siege troops , Clermont decided to take a detour to intercept it . He was joined by a force from Orléans under John of Dunois , which had managed to slip past the English lines . The forces made junction at Janville and attacked the English convoy at Rouvray on 12 February , in an encounter known as the Battle of the Herrings , on account of the convoy being laden with a large supply of fish for the forthcoming Lenten season .
