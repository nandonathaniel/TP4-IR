Network congestion in data networking and queueing theory is the reduced quality of service that occurs when a network node or link is carrying more data than it can handle . Typical effects include queueing delay , packet loss or the blocking of new connections . A consequence of congestion is that an incremental increase in offered load leads either only to a small increase or even a decrease in network throughput .
