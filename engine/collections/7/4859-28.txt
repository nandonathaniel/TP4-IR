Although PCH advertises its sweepstakes along with magazine subscriptions , no purchase is necessary to enter or win . In 1995 , PCH began the tradition of announcing winners of its $10 million prize just after the Super Bowl . As of 2012 , $225 million in prizes have been distributed . Some of its larger prizes are for $5,000 a week for life , or $10 million . Prizes can also range from $1 Amazon gift cards to $2,500 , $1 million or $3 million . The larger cash prizes are paid in installments , typically with a balloon payment at 30 years , reducing the present value of prizes to much less than their nominal values .
