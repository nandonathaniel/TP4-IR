Tex Dinoco , voiced by Humpy Wheeler of Charlotte Motor Speedway , is the owner of Dinoco . Packaged as `` Tex Dinoco with bullhorns '' as a diecast car , he is simply called `` Tex '' in the film 's credits . He speaks with a Carolina accent and resembles a 1975 Cadillac Coupe de Ville at The Big Texan Steak Ranch in Amarillo . He is the King 's manager and sponsor . Unlike Lightning 's agent ( Harv , who does n't watch the race ) , Tex is an avid race fan who would never miss a race . As a supportive and long - time friend of both Lynda and `` The King '' , he has been a loyal fan of the # 43 car for many years and boasts that The King `` has made Dinoco proud '' .
