The Southeastern Conference sponsors championship competition in nine men 's and twelve women 's NCAA sanctioned sports . Under SEC conference rules reflecting the large number of male scholarship participants in football and attempting to address gender equity concerns ( see also Title IX ) , each member institution is required to provide two more women 's varsity sports than men 's . A similar rule was recently adopted by the NCAA for all of Division I .
