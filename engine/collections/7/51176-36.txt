The first railroad to directly connect two oceans ( although not by crossing a broad `` continental '' land mass ) was the Panama Rail Road . Opened in 1855 , this 77 km ( 48 mi ) line was designated instead as an `` inter-oceanic '' railroad crossing Central America at its narrowest point , the Isthmus of Panama , when that area was still part of Colombia . ( Panama split off from Colombia in 1903 and became the independent nation of Panama ) . By spanning the isthmus , the line thus became the first railroad to completely cross any part of the Americas and physically connect ports on the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans . Given the tropical rain forest environment , the terrain , and diseases such as malaria and cholera , its completion was a considerable engineering challenge . The construction took five years after ground was first broken for the line in May , 1850 , cost eight million dollars , and required more than seven thousand workers drawn from `` every quarter of the globe .
