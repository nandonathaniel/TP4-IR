Going back to those studio days for me and John Paul Jones , the one thing you did n't do was speed up , because if you sped up you would n't be seen again . Everything had to be right on the meter all the way through . And I really wanted to write something which did speed up , and took the emotion and the adrenaline with it , and would reach a sort of crescendo . And that was the idea of it . That 's why it was a bit tricky to get together in stages .
