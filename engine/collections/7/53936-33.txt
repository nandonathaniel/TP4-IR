Hieronymus Bosch was a painter of the Netherlands , who employed the type of fanciful forms that were often utilized to decorate borders and letters in illuminated manuscripts , combining plant and animal forms with architectonic ones . When taken from the context of the illumination and peopled with humans , these forms give Bosch 's paintings a surreal quality which have no parallel in the work of any other Renaissance painter . His masterpiece is the triptych The Garden of Earthly Delights .
