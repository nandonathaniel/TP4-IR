In one scene from the video , Idol forces the barbed - wire wedding ring onto the bride 's finger and cuts her knuckle . Lister insisted that her knuckle actually be cut in order for the scene to appear more realistic . MTV initially removed this scene from the video . Also controversial were the apparent Nazi salutes made by the crowd toward the couple . Director David Mallet says he was merely `` playing with the power of crowd imagery '' when he had the extras reach toward the bride and did not realize how it looked until later .
