The authors of the song have repeatedly rejected this interpretation and have strongly and consistently denied that they intended any references to drug use . Leonard Lipton has stated `` Puff the Magic Dragon is not about drugs . '' Peter Yarrow has frequently explained that the song is about the hardships of growing older and has no relationship to drug - taking . He has also said of the song that it `` never had any meaning other than the obvious one '' and is about the `` loss of innocence in children '' , and dismissed the suggestion of association with drugs as `` sloppy research '' .
