The law also attaches importance to the preservation of life : aiding and abetting a suicide is a criminal offence under the Suicide Act 1961 and euthanasia is unlawful ( see the Bland case ) . Furthermore , there is a duty upon medical professionals to keep patients alive unless to do so would be contrary to the patient 's best interests based on professional medical opinion ( the Bolam Test ) , taking into account their quality of life in the event that treatment is continued . The Abortion Act 1967 permits the termination of a pregnancy under certain conditions and the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990 requires the storage of embryos to be licensed .
