The idea for a national theater resurfaced in 1950 , when U.S. Representative Arthur George Klein of New York introduced a bill to authorize funds to plan and build a cultural center . The bill included provisions that the center would prohibit any discrimination of cast or audience . In 1955 , the Stanford Research Institute was commissioned to select a site and provide design suggestions for the center . From 1955 to 1958 , Congress debated the idea amid much controversy . A bill was finally passed in Congress in the summer of 1958 and on September 4 , President Dwight D. Eisenhower signed into law the National Cultural Center Act which provided momentum for the project .
