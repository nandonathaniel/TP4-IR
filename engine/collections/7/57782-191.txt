A side - channel attack using branch prediction analysis ( BPA ) has been described . Many processors use a branch predictor to determine whether a conditional branch in the instruction flow of a program is likely to be taken or not . Often these processors also implement simultaneous multithreading ( SMT ) . Branch prediction analysis attacks use a spy process to discover ( statistically ) the private key when processed with these processors .
