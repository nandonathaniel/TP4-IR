Missing features and issues noted as essential to professional video production in FCPX included lack of edit decision list ( EDL ) , XML and Open Media Framework Interchange ( OMF ) support , inability to import projects created in previous releases of Final Cut Pro , a lack of a multicam editing tool , third - party I / O hardware output , and videotape capture being limited to Firewire video devices only , including capture with third - party hardware , were addressed within the first six months of the product 's life . EDL export , a product of the early days of videotape editing , is now supported through third - party software and creating an AAF ( a newer version of OMF ) for passing projects to ProTools through X2Pro .
