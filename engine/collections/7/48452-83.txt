The Parthenon , the Temple to the Goddess Athena on the Acropolis in Athens , is referred to by many as the pinnacle of ancient Greek architecture . Helen Gardner refers to its `` unsurpassable excellence '' , to be surveyed , studied and emulated by architects of later ages . Yet , as Gardner points out , there is hardly a straight line in the building . Banister Fletcher calculated that the stylobate curves upward so that its centres at either end rise about 2.6 inches above the outer corners , and 4.3 inches on the longer sides . A slightly greater adjustment has been made to the entablature . The columns at the ends of the building are not vertical but are inclined towards the centre , with those at the corners being out of plumb by about 2.6 inches . These outer columns are both slightly wider than their neighbours and are slightly closer than any of the others .
