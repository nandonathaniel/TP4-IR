After the cremation of the deceased at Varanasi 's ghats the bones and ashes are thrown into the Ganges . However , in the past thousands of uncremated bodies were thrown into the Ganges during cholera epidemics , spreading the disease . Even today , holy men , pregnant women , people with leprosy / chicken pox , people who had been bitten by snakes , people who had committed suicide , the poor , and children under 5 are not cremated at the ghats but are floated free to decompose in the waters . In addition , those who can not afford the large amount of wood needed to incinerate the entire body , leave behind a lot of half burned body parts .
