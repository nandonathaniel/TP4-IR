Hydrogen ions are formed from the dissociation of carbonic acid . Water is a very minor source of hydrogen ions in comparison to carbonic acid . Carbonic acid is formed from carbon dioxide and water by carbonic anhydrase . The bicarbonate ion ( HCO ) is exchanged for a chloride ion ( Cl ) on the basal side of the cell and the bicarbonate diffuses into the venous blood , leading to an alkaline tide phenomenon . Potassium ( K ) and chloride ( Cl ) ions diffuse into the canaliculi . Hydrogen ions are pumped out of the cell into the canaliculi in exchange for potassium ions , via the H / K ATPase . These receptors are increased in number on luminal side by fusion of tubulovesicles during activation of parietal cells and removed during deactivation . This receptor maintains a million fold difference in proton concentration . ATP is provided by the numerous mitochondria .
