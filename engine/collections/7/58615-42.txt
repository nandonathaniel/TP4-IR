The core of the group that came to be known as the Pilgrims were brought together between 1586 and 1605 by shared theological beliefs , as expressed by Richard Clyfton , a Brownist parson at All Saints ' Parish Church in Babworth , near East Retford , Nottinghamshire . This congregation held Puritan beliefs comparable to other non-conforming movements ( i.e. , groups not in communion with the Church of England ) led by Robert Browne , John Greenwood , and Henry Barrowe . As Separatists , they also held that their differences with the Church of England were irreconcilable and that their worship should be independent of the trappings , traditions , and organization of a central church -- unlike those Puritans who maintained their membership in and allegiance to the Church of England . William Brewster was a former diplomatic assistant to the Netherlands . He was living in the Scrooby manor house while serving as postmaster for the village and bailiff to the Archbishop of York . He had been impressed by Clyfton 's services and had begun participating in services led by John Smyth in Gainsborough , Lincolnshire .
