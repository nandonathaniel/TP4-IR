As a young man , Myers struggled with a speech impediment that caused many of his classmates and teachers to ridicule him and think him unintelligent . He often got into trouble at school for selling drugs in school and on the streets . When trying to defend himself against the ridicule , many labeled him a `` Monster '' much like how Steve Harmon was labeled a `` Monster . '' Later , while working as a construction worker , Myers decided to follow advice given to him by his high school writing teacher and began writing at night after work , just as the character Steve Harmon writes throughout the novel .
