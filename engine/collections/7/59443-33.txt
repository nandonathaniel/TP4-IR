A team from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers dammed the American Falls in June 1969 to clear rock from the base of the falls . Rockslides caused a significant buildup of rock at the bottom of the American side of the falls , and the engineers were to clean up the rock and repair some faults to prevent eventual erosion of the American side of the waterfall . A temporary dam was built to divert the flow of water to the Canadian side ; the dam measured 600 feet ( 180 m ) across and was made of nearly 30,000 tons of rock . The engineers cleared the rock debris and tested for safety , finishing the project in November of that year . Water flow was restored on November 25 , 1969 .
