His knowledge of the size of Egypt was founded on the work of many generations of surveying trips . Pharaonic bookkeepers gave a distance between Syene and Alexandria of 5,000 stadia ( a figure that was checked yearly ) . Some historians say that the distance was corroborated by inquiring about the time that it took to travel from Syene to Alexandria by camel . Some claim Eratosthenes used the Olympic stade of 176.4 m , which would imply a circumference of 44,100 km , an error of 10 % , but the 184.8 m Italian stade became ( 300 years later ) the most commonly accepted value for the length of the stade , which implies a circumference of 46,100 km , an error of 15 % . It was unlikely , even accounting for his extremely primitive measuring tools , that Eratosthenes could have calculated an accurate measurement for the circumference of the Earth . He made five important assumptions ( none of which is perfectly accurate ) :
