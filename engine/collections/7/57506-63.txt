In typical people who are not known to be at high risk of PE , imaging is helpful to confirm or exclude a diagnosis of PE after simpler first - line tests are used . Medical societies recommend tests such as the D - dimer to first provide supporting evidence for the need for imaging , and imaging would be done if other tests confirmed a moderate or high probability of finding evidence to support a diagnosis of PE .
