To complicate matters , in the years preceding World War I , there existed a tangle of Great Power alliances , both formal and informal , public and secret . Following the Napoleonic Wars there had existed a `` balance of power '' to , in theory , prevent major wars . This theory held that opposing combinations of powers in Europe would be evenly matched entailing that any general war would be far too costly for any nation to risk entering . This system began to fall apart as the Ottoman Empire which had been seen as a check on Russian power began to crumble , and as Germany , which had been a loose confederation of minor states , was united into a major power . Not only did these changes lead to a realignment of power , but of interests as well .
