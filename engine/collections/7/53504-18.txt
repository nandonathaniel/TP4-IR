The 1819 Act for the Resumption of Cash Payments set 1823 as the date for resumption of convertibility , which was reached by 1821 . Throughout the 1820s , small notes were issued by regional banks . This was restricted in 1826 , while the Bank of England was allowed to set up regional branches . In 1833 however , Bank of England notes were made legal tender and redemption by other banks was discouraged . In 1844 , the Bank Charter Act established that Bank of England notes were fully backed by gold and they became the legal standard . According to the strict interpretation of the gold standard , this 1844 act marked the establishment of a full gold standard for British money .
