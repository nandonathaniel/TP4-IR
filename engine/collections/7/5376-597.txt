Statewide smoking ban excluding bars , casinos and some restaurants . Effective September 11 , 2008 , after being signed into law by Governor Ed Rendell on June 13 , 2008 , Pennsylvania 's 1988 Clean Indoor Air Act was amended to ban smoking statewide in all restaurants and other enclosed workplaces in Pennsylvania , except as exempted . The Act exempts ( 1 ) eating / drinking establishments where 20 % or less of sales come from food AND persons under 18 are not allowed , ( 2 ) private homes and vehicles , except those used as a child daycare or adult care facility , ( 3 ) designated hotel / motel smoking rooms , ( 4 ) full service truck stops , ( 5 ) retail tobacco shops , ( 6 ) workplaces of tobacco manufacturers and wholesalers , ( 7 ) nursing homes , ( 8 ) designated smoking areas in day treatment facilities , psychiatric facilities , and healthcare facilities , ( 9 ) private clubs when public events are not being held , including volunteer fire , ambulance , and rescue stations , ( 10 ) tobacco - related fundraisers , ( 11 ) places rented for tobacco exhibitions , ( 12 ) cigar bars , ( 13 ) 25 % of a casino gaming floor , and ( 14 ) outdoor areas . Local governments except Philadelphia are preempted from regulating smoking more stringently than the Act . Philadelphia 's smoking ordinance , which went into effect on January 8 , 2007 , bans smoking in all restaurants , exempting bars where food accounts for less than 10 % of sales and alcohol accounts for more than 90 % of sales , and persons under 18 are prohibited . Philadelphia 's ordinance is the only local smoking ban in Pennsylvania . On April 29 , 2014 , Mayor Michael Nutter passed an executive order banning smoking in all city parks . Allegheny County enacted a smoking ban October 2006 , but it was immediately challenged in court as violating the 1988 Clean Indoor Air Act 's preemption of all local smoking regulations . In May 2007 , the ban was overturned by the Pennsylvania Commonwealth Court .
