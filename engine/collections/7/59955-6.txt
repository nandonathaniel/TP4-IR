The second League Cup loss was an infamous upset -- Arsenal lost 3 -- 1 to Third Division side Swindon Town . Eight of the team had been struck by flu that had led to the postponement of Arsenal 's previous League fixture , and Arsenal had only reached extra time thanks to a late goalkeeping error that had allowed Bobby Gould to score . In extra time , Don Rogers scored twice as Arsenal searched for a winner . However , that season was not a total disaster for Arsenal ; they had also finished fourth , which won them a place in Europe for the 1969 -- 70 season .
