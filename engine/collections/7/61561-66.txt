The Council of Trent ( 1545 -- 1563 ) , initiated by Pope Paul III , addressed issues of certain ecclesiastical corruptions such as simony , nepotism , and other abuses , as well as the reassertion of traditional practices and the dogmatic articulation of the traditional doctrines of the Church , such as the episcopal structure , clerical celibacy , the seven Sacraments , transubstantiation ( the belief that during mass the consecrated bread and wine truly become the body and blood of Christ ) , the veneration of relics , icons , and saints ( especially the Blessed Virgin Mary ) , the necessity of both faith and good works for salvation , the existence of purgatory and the issuance ( but not the sale ) of indulgences , etc . In other words , all Protestant doctrinal objections and changes were uncompromisingly rejected . The council also fostered an interest in education for parish priests to increase pastoral care . Milan 's Archbishop Carlo Borromeo set an example by visiting the remotest parishes and instilling high standards .
