The Dutch took their fight overseas , attacking Spanish and Portuguese colonies and beginning the Dutch -- Portuguese War , which would last for over sixty years ( 1602 -- 1663 ) . Other European nations , such as Protestant England , assisted the Dutch Empire in the war . The Dutch attained victories in Asia and Africa with assistance of various indigenous allies , eventually wrenching control of Malacca , Ceylon , and SÃ£o Jorge da Mina . The Dutch also had regional control of the lucrative sugar - producing region of northeast Brazil as well as Luanda , but the Portuguese regained these territories after considerable struggle .
