Each April ( excluding 2014 when it took place in May ) , the NFL holds a draft of college players . The draft consists of seven rounds , with each of the 32 clubs getting one pick in each round . The draft order for non-playoff teams is determined by regular - season record ; among playoff teams , teams are first ranked by the furthest round of the playoffs they reached , and then are ranked by regular - season record . For example , any team that reached the divisional round will be given a higher pick than any team that reached the conference championships , but will be given a lower pick than any team that did not make the divisional round . The Super Bowl champion always drafts last , and the losing team from the Super Bowl always drafts next - to - last . All potential draftees must be at least three years removed from high school in order to be eligible for the draft . Underclassmen that have met that criterion to be eligible for the draft must write an application to the NFL by January 15 renouncing their remaining college eligibility . Clubs can trade away picks for future draft picks , but can not trade the rights to players they have selected in previous drafts .
