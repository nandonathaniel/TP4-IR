Several antibiotics are effective for treatment including streptomycin , gentamicin , and doxycycline . Without treatment it results in the death of 30 % to 90 % of those infected . Death , if it occurs , is typically within ten days . With treatment the risk of death is around 10 % . Globally there are about 650 documented cases a year which result in ~ 120 deaths .
