Children start primary school aged between 41⁄2 and 51⁄2 depending on when the child 's birthday falls . Scottish school policy places all those born between March of a given year and February of the following year in the same year group . Children born between March and August start school in August at between 51⁄2 and 5 years old , and those born between September and February start school in the previous August at between age 4 years 11 months and 41⁄2 years old . The Scottish system is the most flexible in the UK , however , as parents of children born between September and December can request a deferral for 1 year ( not automatic , requires approval ) , whilst children born between January and February can opt to hold their child back a year and let them start school the following August . This usually allows those not ready for formal education to have an extra year at an early years centre ( formerly known as nursery ) . ( Funding is only available for children born in January and February ) .
