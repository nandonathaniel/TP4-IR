Denial -- The first reaction is denial . In this stage , individuals believe the diagnosis is somehow mistaken , and cling to a false , preferable reality . Anger -- When the individual recognizes that denial can not continue , they become frustrated , especially at proximate individuals . Certain psychological responses of a person undergoing this phase would be : `` Why me ? It 's not fair ! '' ; `` How can this happen to me ? '' ; `` Who is to blame ? '' ; `` Why would this happen ? '' . Bargaining -- The third stage involves the hope that the individual can avoid a cause of grief . Usually , the negotiation for an extended life is made in exchange for a reformed lifestyle . People facing less serious trauma can bargain or seek compromise . For instance : `` I 'd give anything to have him back . '' Or : `` If only he 'd come back to life , I 'd promise to be a better person ! '' Depression -- `` I 'm so sad , why bother with anything ? '' ; `` I 'm going to die soon , so what 's the point ? '' ; `` I miss my loved one ; why go on ? '' During the fourth stage , the individual despairs at the recognition of their mortality . In this state , the individual may become silent , refuse visitors and spend much of the time mournful and sullen . Acceptance -- `` It 's going to be okay . '' ; `` I ca n't fight it ; I may as well prepare for it . '' In this last stage , individuals embrace mortality or inevitable future , or that of a loved one , or other tragic event . People dying may precede the survivors in this state , which typically comes with a calm , retrospective view for the individual , and a stable condition of emotions .
