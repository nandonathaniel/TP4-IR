Changes in when the eligibility of a single first begins , as well as more accurate digital download totals , have made abrupt chart jumps more commonplace . From 1955 to 2001 , under Billboard 's previous methodologies , only two singles ascended directly to # 1 from a previous position beneath the Top 20 : The Beatles ' `` Ca n't Buy Me Love '' , which jumped from # 27 to the top slot in April 1964 , and Brandy and Monica 's `` The Boy Is Mine '' which jumped from # 23 to # 1 in June 1998 .
