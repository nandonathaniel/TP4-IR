In the future , the world is expected to exit the `` fossil fuel age '' , and perhaps the `` nuclear energy age '' , and enter the `` renewable - energy age '' or even further into the `` fusion power age '' , if and whenever these technologies become economically sustainable . Being a region in the sunny tropical belt , the Indian subcontinent could greatly benefit from a renewable energy trend , as it has the ideal combination of both - high solar insolation and a big consumer base density . For example , considering the costs of energy consumed for temperature control ( a major factor influencing a region 's energy intensity ) and the fact that - cooling load requirements , unlike heating , are roughly in phase with the sun 's intensity , cooling from the excessive solar radiation could make great energetic ( and hence economic ) sense in the subcontinent , whenever the required technology becomes competitively cheaper . India also has 25 % of the world 's thorium resources .
