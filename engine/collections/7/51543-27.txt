For the next forty years , the institution struggled to find its identity as it cycled through periods of achieving popularity versus academic excellence . Under the vigorous leadership of President Samuel Chiles Mitchell from 1909 to 1913 , enrollment at the University doubled ; he brought the University to the state by setting up extension courses in 1910 . Incessant criticism by Governor Coleman Livingston Blease over Mitchell 's handling of University affairs led to his resignation and the trustees elected William Spenser Currell with the intention of raising the level of scholarship at the University . Entrance requirements were made more stringent and Currell 's efforts were rewarded when in 1917 the University became the first state - supported college or university in South Carolina to earn accreditation by the Southern Association .
