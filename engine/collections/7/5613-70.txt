There are three avenues of heat loss : convection , conduction , and radiation . If skin temperature is greater than that of the surroundings , the body can lose heat by radiation and conduction . But , if the temperature of the surroundings is greater than that of the skin , the body actually gains heat by radiation and conduction . In such conditions , the only means by which the body can rid itself of heat is by evaporation . So , when the surrounding temperature is higher than the skin temperature , anything that prevents adequate evaporation will cause the internal body temperature to rise . During intense physical activity ( e.g. sports ) , evaporation becomes the main avenue of heat loss . Humidity affects thermoregulation by limiting sweat evaporation and thus heat loss .
