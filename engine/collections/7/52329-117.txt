Indian Art got a boost with the economic liberalisation of the country since the early 1990s . Artists from various fields now started bringing in varied styles of work . Post-liberalisation Indian art thus works not only within the confines of academic traditions but also outside it . In this phase , artists have introduced even newer concepts which have hitherto not been seen in Indian art . Devajyoti Ray has introduced a new genre of art called Pseudorealism . Pseudorealist Art is an original art style that has been developed entirely on the Indian soil . Pseudorealism takes into account the Indian concept of abstraction and uses it to transform regular scenes of Indian life into a fantastic images .
