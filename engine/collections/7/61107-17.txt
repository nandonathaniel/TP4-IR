HSV - 1 and - 2 are transmitted by contact with an infected person who has reactivations of the virus . Herpes simplex virus ( HSV ) - 2 is periodically shed in the human genital tract , most often asymptomatically . Most sexual transmissions occur during periods of asymptomatic shedding . Asymptomatic reactivation means that the virus causes atypical , subtle or hard to notice symptoms that are not identified as an active herpes infection . It is therefore possible to acquire the virus even if no active HSV blisters or sores are present . In one study , daily genital swab samples found HSV - 2 at a median of 12 -- 28 % of days among those who have had an outbreak , and 10 % of days among those suffering from asymptomatic infection , with many of these episodes occurring without visible outbreak ( `` subclinical shedding '' ) .
