An invasive species might be able to use resources that were previously unavailable to native species , such as deep water sources accessed by a long taproot , or an ability to live on previously uninhabited soil types . For example , barbed goatgrass ( Aegilops triuncialis ) was introduced to California on serpentine soils , which have low water - retention , low nutrient levels , a high magnesium / calcium ratio , and possible heavy metal toxicity . Plant populations on these soils tend to show low density , but goatgrass can form dense stands on these soils and crowd out native species that have adapted poorly to serpentine soils .
