The sixth film was simultaneously released in regular cinemas and IMAX 3D everywhere but the United States , due to a conflicting agreement in which Transformers : Revenge of the Fallen was given a four - week window by itself in IMAX in that country . Therefore , the IMAX 3D version of the film was released on 29 July 2009 there . The film 's opening sequence featuring the destruction of the Millennium Bridge was in 3D . The film had been chosen to be screened at the 2008 Royal Film Performance on 17 November , but was not shown . Cinema and Television Benevolent Fund chief executive Peter Hore noted he was `` very disappointed '' with Warner Bros ' decision .
