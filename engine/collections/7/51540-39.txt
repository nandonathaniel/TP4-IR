The 1993 -- 94 derby at Anfield saw Liverpool defeat Everton 2 -- 1 , not having much effect for a mid-table Liverpool side but increasing the risk of relegation ( a battle which was ultimately won ) for Everton . Perhaps the most notable event of this game was the winning goal by Robbie Fowler , who turned 19 the following month and was one of the most promising young players in England at the time .
