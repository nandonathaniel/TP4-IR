The earliest text preserving fragments of George 's narrative is in a Greek hagiography identified by Hippolyte Delehaye of the scholarly Bollandists to be a palimpsest of the fifth century . The compiler of this Acta Sancti Georgii , according to Hippolyte Delehaye , `` confused the martyr with his namesake , the celebrated George of Cappadocia , the Arian intruder into the see of Alexandria and enemy of St. Athanasius '' . An earlier work by Eusebius , Church history , written in the 4th century , contributed to the legend but did not name George or provide significant detail .
