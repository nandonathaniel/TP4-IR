A number of figures have been suggested as first circulating a European eyewitness description of Niagara Falls . The Frenchman Samuel de Champlain visited the area as early as 1604 during his exploration of Canada , and members of his party reported to him the spectacular waterfalls , which he described in his journals . The Finnish - Swedish naturalist Pehr Kalm explored the area in the early 18th century and is credited with the first scientific description of the falls . The consensus honoree for the first description is the Belgian missionary Louis Hennepin , who observed and described the falls in 1677 , earlier than Kalm , after traveling with the explorer René - Robert Cavelier , Sieur de La Salle , thus bringing the falls to the attention of Europeans . Further complicating matters , there is credible evidence the French Jesuit missionary Paul Ragueneau visited the falls some 35 years before Hennepin 's visit , while working among the Huron First Nation in Canada . Jean de Brébeuf also may have visited the falls , while spending time with the Neutral Nation .
