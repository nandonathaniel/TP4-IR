The name `` Babylon '' , meaning `` Gate of the Gods '' was applied to several Mesopotamian cities . Sennacherib renamed the city gates of Nineveh after gods , which suggests that he wished his city to be considered `` a Babylon '' . Only Josephus names Nebuchadnezzar as the king who built the gardens ; although Nebuchadnezzar left many inscriptions , none mentions any garden or engineering works . Diodorus Siculus and Quintus Curtius Rufus specify a `` Syrian '' king . By contrast , Sennacherib left written descriptions , and there is archaeological evidence of his water engineering . His grandson Assurbanipal pictured the mature garden on a sculptured wall panel in his palace . Sennacherib called his new palace and garden `` a wonder for all peoples '' . He describes the making and operation of screws to raise water in his garden . The descriptions of the classical authors fit closely to these contemporary records . Before the Battle of Gaugamela in 331 BC Alexander the Great camped for four days near the aqueduct at Jerwan . The historians who travelled with him would have had ample time to investigate the enormous works around them , recording them in Greek . These first - hand accounts do not survive into our times but were quoted by later Greek writers .
