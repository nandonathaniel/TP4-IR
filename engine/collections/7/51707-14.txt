After a fall in the number of tourists entering India in 1961 from the preceding year , the government constituted a committee headed by Lakshmi Kant Jha , then secretary in the Department of Economic Affairs , under the Ministry of Finance , to find and examine the reasons . The committee attributed it to the Chinese aggression in the backdrop of the Sino - Indian War that year . Subsequently , as per the committee 's recommendations , visa norms were liberlized , and the India Tourism Development Corporation was established in 1966 as a functional agency of the Department of Tourism . Further , Prime Minister Indira Gandhi convened a conference in October that year , the deliberations of which resulted in the creation of the Ministry of Tourism and Civil Aviation . Karan Singh was appointed the first minister .
