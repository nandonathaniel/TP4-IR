Temperature is a monotonic function of the average molecular kinetic energy of a substance . When a substance is heated , the kinetic energy of its molecules increases . Thus , the molecules begin vibrating / moving more and usually maintain a greater average separation . Materials which contract with increasing temperature are unusual ; this effect is limited in size , and only occurs within limited temperature ranges ( see examples below ) . The relative expansion ( also called strain ) divided by the change in temperature is called the material 's coefficient of thermal expansion and generally varies with temperature .
