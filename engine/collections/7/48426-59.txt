The pattern of ' basin and range ' with adjacent basins and ranges in this region results in incredible biological diversity . Climate , elevation , soil type , and many anthropogenic variables greatly influence the diversity and distribution of shrubland , grassland , and woodland communities in the desert . Across the high desert there are numerous sub-climates correlating to the varied elevations . Heading from the valley bottoms to the mountain peaks , one will encounter constantly changing combinations of plant and animal species making up some 200 distinct biological communities . These communities can be generally grouped into six general communities or `` life zones '' .
