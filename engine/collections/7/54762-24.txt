( EU member ) European Union residents in Belgium were given the right to vote and to be candidates for the 1994 European Parliament election , then for the 2000 Municipal elections . They had however first only the right to be elected as municipal councillors , not at the executive level ( schepen / alderman or burgomaster / mayor ) , the alderman level was only opened for them from the 2006 Municipal elections , the mayor level may not be opened to them because it includes a function of administrative police . In conformance with EU regulations , EU residents are submitted to the same residence conditions as Belgian nationals , i.e. residence in the commune at the closure date of the electoral roll ( July 31 for the municipal elections ) .
