`` Brother , Can You Spare a Dime ? '' , also sung as `` Buddy , Can You Spare a Dime ? '' , is one of the best - known American songs of the Great Depression . Written in 1930 by lyricist E.Y. `` Yip '' Harburg and composer Jay Gorney , `` Brother , Can You Spare a Dime ? '' was part of the 1932 musical revue Americana ; the melody is based on a Russian - Jewish lullaby Gorney 's mother had sung to him as a child . It was considered by Republicans to be anti-capitalist propaganda , and almost dropped from the show ; attempts were made to ban it from the radio . The song became best known , however , through recordings by Bing Crosby and Rudy Vallee . They were released right before Franklin Delano Roosevelt 's election to the presidency . The Brunswick Crosby recording made on October 25 , 1932 with Lennie Hayton and his Orchestra became the best - selling record of its period , and came to be viewed as an anthem to the shattered dreams of the era .
