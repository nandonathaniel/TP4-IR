Form 990 ( officially , the `` Return of Organization Exempt From Income Tax '' ) is a United States Internal Revenue Service form that provides the public with financial information about a nonprofit organization . It is often the only source of such information . It is also used by government agencies to prevent organizations from abusing their tax - exempt status . Certain nonprofits have more comprehensive reporting requirements , such as hospitals and other health care organizations ( Schedule H ) .
