Later , Claudius Ptolemy ( ca . 90 -- ca . 168 AD ) expanded upon Hipparchus ' Chords in a Circle in his Almagest , or the Mathematical Syntaxis . The Almagest is primarily a work on astronomy , and astronomy relies on trigonometry . Ptolemy 's table of chords gives the lengths of chords of a circle of diameter 120 as a function of the number of degrees n in the corresponding arc of the circle , for n ranging from 1 / 2 to 180 by increments of 1 / 2 . The thirteen books of the Almagest are the most influential and significant trigonometric work of all antiquity . A theorem that was central to Ptolemy 's calculation of chords was what is still known today as Ptolemy 's theorem , that the sum of the products of the opposite sides of a cyclic quadrilateral is equal to the product of the diagonals . A special case of Ptolemy 's theorem appeared as proposition 93 in Euclid 's Data . Ptolemy 's theorem leads to the equivalent of the four sum - and - difference formulas for sine and cosine that are today known as Ptolemy 's formulas , although Ptolemy himself used chords instead of sine and cosine . Ptolemy further derived the equivalent of the half - angle formula
