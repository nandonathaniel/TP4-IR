As a declared ' enemy of the Emperor ' , Alaric was denied the legitimacy that he needed to collect taxes and hold cities without large garrisons , which he could not afford to detach . He again offered to move his men , this time to Pannonia , in exchange for a modest sum of money and the modest title of Comes , but he was refused as a supporter of Stilicho . He moved into Italy , probably using the route and supplies arranged for him by Stilicho , bypassing the imperial court in Ravenna which was protected by widespread marshland and had a port , and he menaced the city of Rome itself . In 407 , there was no equivalent of the determined response to the catastrophic Battle of Cannae in 216 BCE , when the entire Roman population , even slaves , had been mobilized to resist the enemy .
