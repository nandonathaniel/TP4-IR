The reaction begins in the amygdala , which triggers a neural response in the hypothalamus . The initial reaction is followed by activation of the pituitary gland and secretion of the hormone ACTH . The adrenal gland is activated almost simultaneously , via the sympathetic nervous system , and releases the hormone epinephrine . The release of chemical messengers results in the production of the hormone cortisol , which increases blood pressure , blood sugar , and suppresses the immune system . The initial response and subsequent reactions are triggered in an effort to create a boost of energy . This boost of energy is activated by epinephrine binding to liver cells and the subsequent production of glucose . Additionally , the circulation of cortisol functions to turn fatty acids into available energy , which prepares muscles throughout the body for response . Catecholamine hormones , such as adrenaline ( epinephrine ) or noradrenaline ( norepinephrine ) , facilitate immediate physical reactions associated with a preparation for violent muscular action and :
