On the posterior side the capsule is thin and mainly composed of transverse fibres . A few of these fibres stretch across the olecranon fossa without attaching to it and form a transverse band with a free upper border . On the ulnar side , the capsule reaches down to the posterior part of the annular ligament . The posterior capsule is attached to the triceps tendon which prevents the capsule from being pinched during extension .
