Tropical savanna climate or tropical wet and dry climate is a type of climate that corresponds to the Köppen climate classification categories `` Aw '' and `` As '' . Tropical savanna climates have monthly mean temperatures above 18 ° C ( 64 ° F ) in every month of the year and typically a pronounced dry season , with the driest month having precipitation less than 60 mm and also less than 100 -- ( total annual precipitation ( mm ) / 25 ) of precipitation . This latter fact is in direct contrast to a tropical monsoon climate , whose driest month sees less than 60 mm of precipitation but has more than 100 -- ( total annual precipitation ( mm ) / 25 ) of precipitation . In essence , a tropical savanna climate tends to either see less rainfall than a tropical monsoon climate or have more pronounced dry seasons .
