Casting began around August 2013 , with Abrams meeting with potential actors for script readings and screen tests . Open auditions were held in the UK , Ireland , and the United States in November 2013 for the roles of Rachel and Thomas . Casting began in earnest in January 2014 , because of changes to the script by Kasdan and Abrams . Screen tests with actors continued until at least three weeks before the official announcement on April 29 , 2014 , with final casting decisions made only a few weeks prior . Actors testing had strict non-disclosure agreements , preventing them , their agents or publicists from commenting on their potential involvement .
