Tom ( portrayed by David Durham ) was the father of Guinevere and Elyan . He worked as a blacksmith in Camelot . When Nimueh poisoned the city 's water supply , he fell victim to the magical plague which had killed many others . Merlin cured him using magic , resulting in Gwen being blamed for causing the plague . She was arrested for witchcraft but later released , and joyfully reunited with her father . Tom made the sword which became Excalibur when the Great Dragon gave it magical powers for Arthur 's use . He later became involved in a plot by a sorcerer , Tauren , to perform alchemy using the legendary Philosopher 's Stone ( referred to in dialogue as the `` Mage Stone '' ) . Tom was arrested and put on trial for treason in unwittingly assisting a known enemy of Camelot , because Uther believed that Tom was supplying weapons to Tauren . Morgana suspected that the trial was a formality and Uther planned to have Tom executed anyway just to make an example of him . He was then killed by soldiers after she helped him to escape from the dungeons .
