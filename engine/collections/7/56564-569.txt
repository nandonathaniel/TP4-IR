There are hundreds if not thousands of place names derived from Arabic in the Iberian peninsula including provinces and regions , cities , towns , villages and even neighborhoods and streets . They also include geographical features such as mountains , mountain ranges , valleys and rivers . Toponyms derived from Arabic are common in all of Spain ( including much of the North of the country ) except for those regions which never came under Muslim rule or where it was particularly short - lived . These regions include Galicia and the Northern coast ( Asturias , Cantabria and the Basque country ) as well as much of Catalonia , Navarre and northern Aragon . Regions where place names of Arabic origin are particularly common are the Eastern Coast ( Valencia and Murcia ) and the region of Andalusia . In Portugal , the frequency of Arabic toponyms increases as one travels south in the country .
