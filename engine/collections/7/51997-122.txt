In the Agadir Crisis of 1911 France strong - armed itself into seizing more control over Morocco . The German Foreign Minister Alfred von Kiderlen - Waechter was not opposed to these moves , but he felt Germany was entitled to some compensation elsewhere in Africa . He sent a small warship , made saber - rattling threats , and whipped up anger among German nationalists . France and Germany soon agreed on a compromise . However , the British cabinet was alarmed at Germany 's aggressiveness toward France . David Lloyd George made a dramatic `` Mansion House '' speech that denounced the German move as an intolerable humiliation . There was talk of war , and Germany backed down . Relations between Berlin and London remained sour .
