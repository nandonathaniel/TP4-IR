Premier Parks purchased Six Flags from Time Warner and Boston Ventures on April 1 , 1998 . The following year , the new management team added a dozen flat rides to the park and declared a `` war on lines '' . The Adventure River complex was retired but the flume ride and the Congo Rapids remained . A kiddie water play area also remained as part of a new kiddie ride area called Looney Tunes Seaport . A junior roller coaster called Blackbeard 's Lost Treasure Train ( now known as Harley Quinn Crazy Train ) as well as a kiddie roller coaster called Road Runner Railway were also added , but the star attraction was a floorless steel multiple looping roller coaster called Medusa ( now known as Bizarro ) .
