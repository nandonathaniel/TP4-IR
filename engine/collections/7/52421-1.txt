Based on human ecology theory done by Burgess and applied on Chicago , it was the first to give the explanation of distribution of social groups within urban areas . This concentric ring model depicts urban land usage in concentric rings : the Central Business District ( or CBD ) was in the middle of the model , and the city expanded in rings with different land uses . It is effectively an urban version of Von Th√ºnen 's regional land use model developed a century earlier . It influenced the later development of Homer Hoyt 's sector model ( 1939 ) and Harris and Ullman 's multiple nuclei model ( 1945 ) .
