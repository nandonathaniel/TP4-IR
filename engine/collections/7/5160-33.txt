An ongoing topic of controversy is whether the separation of Church and State should be weakened so that the government would be able to subsidize Muslim prayer rooms and the formation of imams . Advocates of such measures , such as Nicolas Sarkozy at times , declare that they would encourage the Muslim population to better integrate into the fabric of French society . Opponents contend that the state should not fund religions . Furthermore , the state ban on wearing conspicuous religious symbols , such as the Islamic female headscarf , in public schools has alienated some French Muslims , provoked minor street protests and drawn some international criticism .
