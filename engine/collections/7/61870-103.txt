Candido , ovvero un sogno fatto in Sicilia ( it ) ( 1977 ) or simply Candido is a book by Leonardo Sciascia . It was at least partly based on Voltaire 's Candide , although the actual influence of Candide on Candido is a hotly debated topic . A number of theories on the matter have been proposed . Proponents of one say that Candido is very similar to Candide , only with a happy ending ; supporters of another claim that Voltaire provided Sciascia with only a starting point from which to work , that the two books are quite distinct .
