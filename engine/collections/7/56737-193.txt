The season 2 finale of the Australian TV show Miss Fisher 's Murder Mysteries ( `` Murder under the Mistletoe '' , 2013 ) mirrors the plot of Christie 's novel . Guests stranded in a secluded mansion are murdered one by one according to the circumstances described in the `` 12 Days of Christmas . '' Like in the Christie novel , the guests soon realize that the murderer must be among them , but the culprit escapes detection by means of a bluff involving one of the corpses . The episode follows the 1965 film Ten Little Indians in re-imagining the island as a snowed - in inaccessible chalet .
