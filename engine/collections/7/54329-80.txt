Many externalities arise from lack of property rights . Consequently , introducing property rights will internalize many costs and benefits . In a gift economy , people are expected to consume what they are given . If they consume a gift which they value less than somebody else , that other person who can not consume it is harmed , an externality . A market system will reduce this kind of externality because the person who values it less is more likely to trade it away and the person who values it more is more likely to trade for it .
