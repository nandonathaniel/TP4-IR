There have been attempts to connect Eurṓpē to a Semitic term for `` west '' , this being either Akkadian erebu meaning `` to go down , set '' ( said of the sun ) or Phoenician ' ereb `` evening , west '' , which is at the origin of Arabic Maghreb and Hebrew ma'arav . Michael A. Barry , professor in Princeton University 's Near Eastern Studies Department , finds the mention of the word Ereb on an Assyrian stele with the meaning of `` night , ( the country of ) sunset '' , in opposition to Asu `` ( the country of ) sunrise '' , i.e. Asia . The same naming motive according to `` cartographic convention '' appears in Greek Ἀνατολή ( Anatolḗ `` ( sun ) rise '' , `` east '' , hence Anatolia ) . Martin Litchfield West stated that `` phonologically , the match between Europa 's name and any form of the Semitic word is very poor . '' Next to these hypotheses there is also a Proto - Indo - European root * h regwos , meaning `` darkness '' , which also produced Greek Erebus .
