An all - wild card matchup ( teams who failed to win their divisions ) -- Ten wild card teams have won conference titles since the AFL -- NFL merger , but never two in the same season . The closest the NFL has come to having an all - wild card Super Bowl occurred during the 2010 -- 11 NFL playoffs when the New York Jets , a wild card team , reached the AFC Championship Game where they played the Pittsburgh Steelers . The Pittsburgh Steelers beat the New York Jets 24 -- 19 . In the subsequent Super Bowl , the Pittsburgh Steelers faced another wild card team , the Green Bay Packers , who beat them 31 -- 25 . Every Super Bowl has had a first or second seeded team .
