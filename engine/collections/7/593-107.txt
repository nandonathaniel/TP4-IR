In 2015 , Curry wore sneakers that had Deah Shaddy Barakat 's name on them ( one of the victims of the 2015 Chapel Hill shooting ) . According to his sister Suzanne , Deah Barakat was known for his `` love for basketball and anything Steph Curry . '' Deah 's number for his intramural basketball team at North Carolina State University was Curry 's No. 30 and he posed for a photo that was similar to one that Curry did for GQ . Curry said that Barakat 's family `` did a great job of reaching out to me and making me aware of the details of his life and personality ( ... ) It was really kind of a cool deal to be able to use the platform yesterday to honor Deah and his family ( ... ) I 'm going to send them the shoes I wore yesterday . And hopefully they know that I 've been thinking about them . '' Also in 2015 , after winning the MVP award following his impressive season , Curry donated his prize vehicle -- a 2016 Kia Sorento -- to the East Oakland Youth Development Center , a local non-profit organization located in the backyard of Oracle Arena .
