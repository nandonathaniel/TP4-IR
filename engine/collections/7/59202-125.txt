Journalists report complaints that , `` these days , if a student is lucky enough to study in the West , he will rarely come home . There are so few good jobs that everyone , from students to middle - aged engineers , is looking for a way out . '' An estimated `` two to four million entrepreneurs , professionals , technicians , and skilled craftspeople ( and their capital ) '' emigrated to other countries following the revolution , and continue to do so at a rate of more than 150,000 a year . This flight of intellectual capital is estimated to come to almost $6 billion a year in growth opportunities , based on the average Iranian professional contributing $40,000 per year to gross capital formation .
