Article 124 of the Constitution of India provides for the manner of appointing judges to the Supreme Court . Though no specific provision exists in the Constitution for appointing the Chief Justice , who , as a result , is appointed like the other judges conventionally , the outgoing CJI recommends the name of the senior-most judge ( i.e. by date of appointment to the Supreme Court ) for appointment by the President of India , as his successor .
