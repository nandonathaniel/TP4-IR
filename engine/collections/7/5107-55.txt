The legislation which set the price to 49 cents was enacted as a temporary measure and as an `` exigent surcharge for mailing products and services '' . However , this legislation was set to expire in April 2016 . As a result , the Post Office retained one cent of the price change as a previously allotted adjustment for inflation , but the price of a first class stamp became 47 cents : for the first time in 97 years ( and for the third time in the agency 's history ) , the price of a stamp decreased .
