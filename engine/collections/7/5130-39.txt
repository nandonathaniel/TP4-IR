Most information in the Soviet economy flowed from the top down . There were several mechanisms in place for producers and consumers to provide input and information that would help in the drafting of economic plans ( as detailed below ) , but the political climate was such that few people ever provided negative input or criticism of the plan . Thus , Soviet planners had very little reliable feedback that they could use to determine the success of their plans . This meant that economic planning was often done based on faulty or outdated information , particularly in sectors with large numbers of consumers . As a result , some goods tended to be underproduced , leading to shortages , while other goods were overproduced and accumulated in storage . Low - level managers often did not report such problems to their superiors , relying instead on each other for support . Some factories developed a system of barter and either exchanged or shared raw materials and parts without the knowledge of the authorities and outside the parameters of the economic plan .
