Consider the question of whether a tossed coin is fair ( i.e. that on average it lands heads up 50 % of the time ) and an experiment where you toss the coin 5 times . A possible result of the experiment that we consider here is 5 heads . Let outcomes be considered unlikely with respect to an assumed distribution if their probability is lower than a significance threshold of 0.05 .
