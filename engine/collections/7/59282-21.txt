The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act ( RCRA ) is the primary federal law that governs hazardous waste management . The owner or operator of a cruise ship may be a generator and / or a transporter of hazardous waste , and thus subject to RCRA rules . Issues that the cruise ship industry may face relating to RCRA include ensuring that hazardous waste is identified at the point at which it is considered generated ; ensuring that parties are properly identified as generators , storers , treaters , or disposers ; and determining the applicability of RCRA requirements to each . Hazardous waste generated onboard cruise ships are stored onboard until the wastes can be offloaded for recycling or disposal in accordance with RCRA .
