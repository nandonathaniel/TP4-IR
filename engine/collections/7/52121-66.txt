Neutral / No gear ( N ) This disengages all gear trains within the transmission , effectively disconnecting the transmission from the driven wheels , allowing the vehicle to coast freely under its own weight and gain momentum without the motive force from the engine . Coasting in idle down long grades ( where law permits ) should be avoided , though , with many transmission designs as the transmission 's lubrication pump is commonly driven by the input ( engine ) side , which may not provide sufficient fluid flow at engine idle speed for high - speed travel . Similarly , emergency towing ( with the driven wheels of the disabled and non-running vehicle on the ground ) with an automatic transmission in neutral is not permitted by the manufacturer for many vehicles . Manufacturers understand emergency situations and list limitations of towing a vehicle in neutral ( usually not to exceed 55 mph and 50 miles ) . This is the only other selection in which the vehicle 's engine may be started .
