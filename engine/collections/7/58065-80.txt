Despite their losses at the Alamo , the Mexican army in Texas still outnumbered the Texian army by almost six to one . Santa Anna assumed that knowledge of the disparity in troop numbers and the fate of the Texian soldiers at the Alamo would quell the resistance , and that Texian soldiers would quickly leave the territory . News of the Alamo 's fall had the opposite effect , however , and men flocked to join Houston 's army . The New York Post editorialized that `` had ( Santa Anna ) treated the vanquished with moderation and generosity , it would have been difficult if not impossible to awaken that general sympathy for the people of Texas which now impels so many adventurous and ardent spirits to throng to the aid of their brethren '' .
