On the night of 10 August in Washington , U.S. colonels Dean Rusk and Charles H. Bonesteel III were tasked with dividing the Korean Peninsula into Soviet and U.S. occupation zones and proposed the 38th parallel . This was incorporated into the U.S. General Order No. 1 which responded to the Japanese surrender on 15 August . Explaining the choice of the 38th parallel , Rusk observed , `` even though it was further north than could be realistically reached by U.S. forces , in the event of Soviet disagreement ... we felt it important to include the capital of Korea in the area of responsibility of American troops '' . He noted that he was `` faced with the scarcity of US forces immediately available , and time and space factors , which would make it difficult to reach very far north , before Soviet troops could enter the area '' . As Rusk 's comments indicate , the U.S. doubted whether the Soviet government would agree to this . Stalin , however , maintained his wartime policy of co-operation , and on 16 August the Red Army halted at the 38th parallel for three weeks to await the arrival of U.S. forces in the south .
