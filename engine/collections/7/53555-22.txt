The gun - type and implosion - type designs were codenamed `` Thin Man '' and `` Fat Man '' respectively . These code names were created by Robert Serber , a former student of Oppenheimer 's who worked on the Manhattan Project . He chose them based on their design shapes ; the Thin Man would be a very long device , and the name came from the Dashiell Hammett detective novel The Thin Man and series of movies by the same name ; the Fat Man would be round and fat and was named after Sydney Greenstreet 's character in The Maltese Falcon . Little Boy would come last , as a variation of Thin Man . The use of the term `` little boy '' for the uranium - 235 gun - type device is not known to have had any connection to George L. Harrison 's use of the same term on the morning of July 18 , 1945 , in his report to President Harry Truman , while he attended the Potsdam Conference , concerning the success of the Trinity test two days earlier .
