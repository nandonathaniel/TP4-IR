In a capability - based model , holding an unforgeable reference or capability to an object provides access to the object ( roughly analogous to how possession of one 's house key grants one access to one 's house ) ; access is conveyed to another party by transmitting such a capability over a secure channel In an ACL - based model , a subject 's access to an object depends on whether its identity appears on a list associated with the object ( roughly analogous to how a bouncer at a private party would check an ID to see if a name appears on the guest list ) ; access is conveyed by editing the list . ( Different ACL systems have a variety of different conventions regarding who or what is responsible for editing the list and how it is edited . )
