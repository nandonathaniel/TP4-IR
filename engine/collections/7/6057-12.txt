Benzodiazepines enhance the effect of the neurotransmitter gamma - aminobutyric acid ( GABA ) at the GABA receptor , resulting in sedative , hypnotic ( sleep - inducing ) , anxiolytic ( anti-anxiety ) , anticonvulsant , and muscle relaxant properties . High doses of many shorter - acting benzodiazepines may also cause anterograde amnesia and dissociation . These properties make benzodiazepines useful in treating anxiety , insomnia , agitation , seizures , muscle spasms , alcohol withdrawal and as a premedication for medical or dental procedures . Benzodiazepines are categorized as either short - , intermediate - , or long - acting . Short - and intermediate - acting benzodiazepines are preferred for the treatment of insomnia ; longer - acting benzodiazepines are recommended for the treatment of anxiety .
