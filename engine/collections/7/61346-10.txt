q = 2 corresponds to the arithmetic mean . As q approaches infinity , the generalized mean approaches the maximum p i ( \ displaystyle p_ ( i ) ) value . In practice , q modifies species weighting , such that increasing q increases the weight given to the most abundant species , and fewer equally abundant species are hence needed to reach mean proportional abundance . Consequently , large values of q lead to smaller species diversity than small values of q for the same dataset . If all species are equally abundant in the dataset , changing the value of q has no effect , but species diversity at any value of q equals species richness .
