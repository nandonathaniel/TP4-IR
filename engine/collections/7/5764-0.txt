Heart of palm is a vegetable harvested from the inner core and growing bud of certain palm trees ( notably the coconut ( Cocos nucifera ) , palmito juçara ( Euterpe edulis ) , Açaí palm ( Euterpe oleracea ) , sabal ( Sabal spp . ) , pupunha and pejibaye ( Bactris gasipaes ) palms ) . Harvesting of many non-cultivated or wild single - stemmed palms results in palm tree death ( e.g. Geonoma edulis ) . However , other palm species are clonal or multi-stemmed plants ( e.g. Prestoea acuminata , Euterpe oleracea ) and moderate harvesting will not kill the entire clonal palm . Heart of palm may be eaten on its own , and often it is eaten in a salad .
