On June 26 , 1940 the Soviet government issued an ultimatum to the Romanian minister in Moscow , demanding Romania immediately cede Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina . Italy and Germany , which needed a stable Romania and access to its oil fields urged King Carol II to do so . Under duress , with no prospect of aid from France or Britain , Carol complied . On June 28 , Soviet troops crossed the Dniester and occupied Bessarabia , Northern Bukovina , and the Hertza region .
