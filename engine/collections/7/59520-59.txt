Sara Bibel of Xfinity wrote that she had hoped Nikki 's relationship with Deacon Sharpe ( Sean Kanan ) would blossom into a `` real romance '' . She also wrote about Nikki and Victor 's union , stating : `` Nikki and Victor 's ( Eric Braeden ) romance has lasted three decades because they were separated for years at a time , involved in fully developed , longterm relationships with other characters , while continuing to be drawn into each other 's orbit . It 's a shame that the current regime has not realized the story potential of keeping these characters apart . '' Bibel criticized Nikki 's reunion with Jack in 2012 , blaming it on the soap opera 's `` creative trouble '' . She wrote : `` They were a great couple the first time they got together . There seemed like a parallel between the back problems that Nikki was struggling with when they were married and Jack 's paralysis . It seemed like the recipe for a beautiful love story , as Nikki helped Jack realize that he was still desirable despite his injury and help him adjust to the changes in his life until , being that this is a soap , he miraculously regains the ability to walk again . Instead of watching a friendship bloom into romance , Jack and Nikki hooked up one night in Vegas and , bam , instant relationship . '' The following year , she predicted Nikki could be potentially diagnosed with either multiple sclerosis or Parkinson 's disease . Bibel wrote that she usually finds soap opera medical storylines `` tedious because I know going in that the character will inevitably be cured . But giving a character a chronic but manageable illness is a fresh spin . ''
