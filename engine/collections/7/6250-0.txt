Dialysis tubing , also known as Visking tubing , is a type of semi-permeable membrane tubing used in separation techniques , that facilitates the removal or exchange of small molecules from macromolecules in solution based on differential diffusion . In the context of life science research , dialysis tubing is typically used in the sample clean - up and processing of proteins and DNA samples or complex biological samples such as blood or serums . Dialysis tubing is also frequently used as a teaching aid to demonstrate the principles of diffusion , osmosis , Brownian motion and the movement of molecules across a restrictive membrane . For the principles and usage of dialysis in a research setting , see Dialysis ( biochemistry ) .
