Early editors of the Song of Roland , informed in part by patriotic desires to produce a distinctly French epic , could thus overstate the textual cohesiveness of the Roland tradition . This point is clearly expressed by Andrew Taylor , who notes , `` ( T ) he Roland song was , if not invented , at the very least constructed . By supplying it with an appropriate epic title , isolating it from its original codicological context , and providing a general history of minstrel performance in which its pure origin could be located , the early editors presented a 4,002 line poem as sung French epic '' .
