Salad fork : Similar to a regular fork , but may be shorter , or have one of the outer tines shaped differently . Often , a `` salad fork '' in the silverware service of some restaurants ( especially chains ) may be simply a second fork ; conversely , some restaurants may omit it , offering only one fork in their service .
