Epstein 's death in August 1967 left the Beatles without management ; Starr remarked : `` ( It was ) a strange time for us , when it 's someone who we 've relied on in the business , where we never got involved . '' Soon afterwards , the band began an ill - fated film project , Magical Mystery Tour . Starr 's growing interest in photography at the time led to his billing as the movie 's Director of Photography , and his participation in the film 's editing was matched only by that of McCartney .
