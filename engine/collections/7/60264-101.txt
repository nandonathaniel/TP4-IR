Integrated Drive Electronics ( IDE ) , later standardized under the name AT Attachment ( ATA , with the alias PATA ( Parallel ATA ) retroactively added upon introduction of SATA ) moved the HDD controller from the interface card to the disk drive . This helped to standardize the host / controller interface , reduce the programming complexity in the host device driver , and reduced system cost and complexity . The 40 - pin IDE / ATA connection transfers 16 bits of data at a time on the data cable . The data cable was originally 40 - conductor , but later higher speed requirements led to an `` ultra DMA '' ( UDMA ) mode using an 80 - conductor cable with additional wires to reduce cross talk at high speed .
