The process of ovulation is controlled by the hypothalamus of the brain and through the release of hormones secreted in the anterior lobe of the pituitary gland , luteinizing hormone ( LH ) and follicle - stimulating hormone ( FSH ) . In the preovulatory phase of the menstrual cycle , the ovarian follicle will undergo a series of transformations called cumulus expansion , which is stimulated by FSH . After this is done , a hole called the stigma will form in the follicle , and the secondary oocyte will leave the follicle through this hole . Ovulation is triggered by a spike in the amount of FSH and LH released from the pituitary gland . During the luteal ( post-ovulatory ) phase , the secondary oocyte will travel through the fallopian tubes toward the uterus . If fertilized by a sperm , the fertilized secondary oocyte or ovum may implant there 6 -- 12 days later .
