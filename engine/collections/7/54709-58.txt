Steller 's sea cow ( Hydrodamalis gigas ) is an extinct sirenian discovered by Europeans in 1741 . At that time , it was found only around the Commander Islands in the Bering Sea between Alaska and Russia ; its range was more extensive during the Pleistocene epoch , and it is possible that the animal and humans previously interacted . Some 18th - century adults would have reached weights of 8 -- 10 t ( 8.8 -- 11.0 short tons ) and lengths up to 9 m ( 30 ft ) .
