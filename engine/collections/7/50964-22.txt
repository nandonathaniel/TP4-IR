Sylvia Nasar wrote in her book A Beautiful Mind that in February 1995 , after acrimony pertaining to the awarding of the 1994 Prize in Economics to John Forbes Nash , the Prize in Economics was redefined as a prize in social sciences . This makes it available to researchers in such topics as political science , psychology , and sociology . Moreover , the composition of the Economics Prize Committee changed to include two non-economists . This has not been confirmed by the Economics Prize Committee . The members of the 2007 Economics Prize Committee are still dominated by economists , as the secretary and four of the five members are professors of economics . In 1978 , Herbert A. Simon , whose PhD was in political science , became the first non-economist to win the prize , while Daniel Kahneman , a professor of psychology and international relations at Princeton University is the first non-economist by profession to win the prize .
