Users are often the targets as well as the source of information in social networking . Users leave digital imprints during browsing of social networking sites or services . It has been identified from few of online studies conducted , that users trust websites and social networking sites . As per trust referred , `` trust is defined in ( Mayer , Davis , and Schoorman , 1995 ) as `` the willingness of a party to be vulnerable to the actions of another party based on the expectation that the other will perform a particular action important to the trustor , irrespective of the ability to monitor or control that other party '' ( p. 712 ) `` . A survey was conducted by Carnegie Mellon University , a majority of users provided their living city , phone numbers among other personal information , while user is clearly unaware of consequences of sharing certain information . Adding to this insight , is the social networking users are from various cities , remote villages , towns , cultures , traditions , religions , background , economic classes , education background , time zones and so on that highlight the significant gap in awareness .
