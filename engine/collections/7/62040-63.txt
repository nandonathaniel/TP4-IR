The primary cause of inkjet printing problems is ink drying on the printhead 's nozzles , causing the pigments and dyes to dry out and form a solid block of hardened mass that plugs the microscopic ink passageways . Most printers attempt to prevent this drying from occurring by covering the printhead nozzles with a rubber cap when the printer is not in use . Abrupt power losses , or unplugging the printer before it has capped the printhead , can cause the printhead to be left in an uncapped state . Even when the head is capped , this seal is not perfect , and over a period of several weeks the moisture ( or other solvent ) can still seep out , causing the ink to dry and harden . Once ink begins to collect and harden , the drop volume can be affected , drop trajectory can change , or the nozzle can completely fail to jet ink .
