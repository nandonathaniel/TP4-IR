In Virginia , state habeas corpus for condemned men are heard by the state supreme court under exclusive original jurisdiction since 1995 , immediately after direct review by the same court . This avoids any proceeding before the lower courts , and is in part why Virginia has the shortest time on average between death sentence and execution ( less than eight years ) and has executed 113 offenders since 1976 with only five remaining on death row as of June 2017 .
