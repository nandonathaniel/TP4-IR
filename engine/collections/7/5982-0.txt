A United States Navy enlisted rate indicates where an enlisted sailor stands within the chain of command , and also defines one 's pay grade . An enlisted sailor 's rate is similar conceptually to a naval officer 's rank . Only naval officers carry the term `` rank '' . The word rate refers to an enlisted sailor 's pay grade , while the word rating refers to one 's area of occupational specialization within the enlisted Navy . Associated with the enlisted pay grades is a numbering system from the most junior enlisted sailor ( `` E-1 '' ) to the most senior enlisted sailor ( `` E-9 '' ) . This enlisted numbering system is the same across all five branches of the U.S. military . All E-1 through E-3 are known as Seamen . E-4 through E-6 are called petty officers . All E-7s are called chief petty officer , E-8s senior chief petty officer , and E-9s master chief petty officer . Rates are displayed on a rating badge , which is a combination of rate and rating . E-2s and E-3s have color - coded group rate marks based on their career field . Personnel in pay grade E-1 , since 1996 , do not have an insignia to wear .
