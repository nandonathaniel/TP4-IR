Although the very young nation had a chronic shortage of weapons to go to war , it was determined to defend itself . Although there was much sympathy in Europe and elsewhere , only five countries ( Tanzania , Gabon , CÃ´te d'Ivoire , Zambia , and Haiti ) officially recognised the new republic . Britain supplied amounts of heavy weapons and ammunition to the Nigerian side because of its desire to preserve the country it had created . The Biafra side received arms and ammunition from France even though French government denied sponsoring Biafra . An article in Paris Match of 20 November 1968 claimed that French arms were reaching Biafra through neighbouring countries such as Gabon . The heavy supply of weapons by Britain was the biggest factor in determining the outcome of the war .
