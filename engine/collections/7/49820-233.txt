There is a sociologist and demographer called Elizabeth Wrigley - Field who is currently teaching at Columbia University , N.Y. She has her name from her parents ( her mother was a Wrigley , her father a Field ) but they called her simply Field , so she had to take legal steps to change her name to Wrigley - Field .
