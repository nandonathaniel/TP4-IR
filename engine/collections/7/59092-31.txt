On occasion , the material of introduction reappears in its original tempo later in the movement . Often , this occurs as late as the coda , as in Mozart 's String Quintet in D major KV 593 , Haydn 's `` Drumroll '' Symphony , Beethoven 's Piano Sonata No. 8 ( `` Pathétique '' ) , or Schubert 's Symphony No. 9 ( `` Great '' ) . Sometimes it can appear earlier : it occurs at the beginning of the development in the Pathétique Sonata , and at the beginning of the recapitulation of Schubert 's Symphony No. 1 .
