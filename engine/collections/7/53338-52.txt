Director Toby Haynes has previously worked on Sherlock and Doctor Who . He also was a fan of Star Trek , and helped to fill in appropriate details from that show within this episode that Brooker had not included , such as putting Lowry in a red uniform since she was the first to be killed off . Haynes was also a fan of Star Wars and brought in at least three direct references to the films . Filming began in January 2017 , and ran for twenty days . The episode was mostly shot in the U.K. , with roughly three days of filming in the Canary Islands for interplanetary scenes . The scenes set on the Callister ship , Daly 's apartment , and the Callister offices were shot at Twickenham Studios , with all of the office scenes shot within three days . Most scenes had to be done in two or three takes , with some scenes such as Walton 's description of Tommy being filmed in one take . Haynes and Milioti both commented on the tight schedule , with Haynes feeling that the pressure helped everyone to rise to the challenge .
