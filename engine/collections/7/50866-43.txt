SWFs are typically created when governments have budgetary surpluses and have little or no international debt . It is not always possible or desirable to hold this excess liquidity as money or to channel it into immediate consumption . This is especially the case when a nation depends on raw material exports like oil , copper or diamonds . In such countries , the main reason for creating a SWF is because of the properties of resource revenue : high volatility of resource prices , unpredictability of extraction , and exhaustibility of resources .
