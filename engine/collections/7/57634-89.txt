The Esquipulas Peace Agreement was an initiative in the mid-1980s to settle the military conflicts that had plagued Central America for many years , and in some cases ( notably Guatemala ) for decades . It built upon groundwork laid by the Contadora Group from 1983 to 1985 . The agreement was named for Esquipulas , Guatemala , where the initial meetings took place . The US Congress lobbying efforts were helped by one of Capitol Hill 's top lobbyists , William C. Chasey .
