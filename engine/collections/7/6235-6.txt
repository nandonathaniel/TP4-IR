The halo effect is a type of immediate judgement discrepancy , or cognitive bias , where a person making an initial assessment of another person , place , or thing will assume ambiguous information based upon concrete information . A simplified example of the halo effect is when an individual noticing that the person in the photograph is attractive , well groomed , and properly attired , assumes , using a mental heuristic , that the person in the photograph is a good person based upon the rules of that individual 's social concept . This constant error in judgment is reflective of the individual 's preferences , prejudices , ideology , aspirations , and social perception . The halo effect is an evaluation by an individual and can affect the perception of a decision , action , idea , business , person , group , entity , or other whenever concrete data is generalized or influences ambiguous information .
