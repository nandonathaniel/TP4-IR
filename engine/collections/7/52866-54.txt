Akitsukuni ( 秋津 国 ) , Akitsushima ( 秋 津島 ) , Toyo - akitsushima ( 豊秋 津島 ) . According to the literal meanings of the Chinese characters used to transcribe these names of Japan , toyo means `` abundant , '' aki means `` autumn , '' tsu means `` harbor , '' shima means `` island , '' and kuni means `` country , land . '' In this context , - tsu may be interpreted to be a fossilized genitive case suffix , as in matsuge `` eyelash '' ( < Japanese me `` eye '' + - tsu + Japanese ke `` hair '' ) or tokitsukaze `` a timely wind , a favorable wind '' ( < Japanese toki `` time '' + - tsu + Japanese kaze `` wind '' ) . However , akitu or akidu are also archaic or dialectal Japanese words for `` dragonfly , '' so `` Akitsushima '' may be interpreted to mean `` Dragonfly Island . '' Another possible interpretation would take akitsu - to be identical with the akitsu - of akitsukami or akitsumikami ( `` god incarnate , a manifest deity , '' often used as an honorific epithet for the Emperor of Japan ) , perhaps with the sense of `` the present land , the island ( s ) where we are at present .
