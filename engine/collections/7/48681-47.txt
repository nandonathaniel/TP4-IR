The Grateful Dead wrote several songs about , or in response to , what lyricist Robert Hunter called `` the Altamont affair '' , including `` New Speedway Boogie '' ( featuring the line `` One way or another , this darkness got to give '' ) and `` Mason 's Children '' . Both songs were written and recorded during sessions for the early 1970 album Workingman 's Dead , but `` Mason 's Children '' was viewed as too `` popular '' stylistically and was consequently not included on the album .
