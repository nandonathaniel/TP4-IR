These issues are due to the exposed tail rotor cutting through open air around rear of the vehicle . This issue disappears when the tail is instead ducted , using an internal impeller enclosed in the tail and a jet of high pressure air sideways out of the tail , as the main rotor vortices can not impact the operation of an internal impeller .
