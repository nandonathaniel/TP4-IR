The National Air and Space Museum is a center for research into the history and science of aviation and spaceflight , as well as planetary science and terrestrial geology and geophysics . Almost all space and aircraft on display are originals or the original backup craft . It operates an annex , the Steven F. Udvar - Hazy Center , at Dulles International Airport , which opened in 2003 and itself encompasses 760,000 square feet ( 71,000 m ) . The museum currently conducts restoration of its collection at the Paul E. Garber Preservation , Restoration , and Storage Facility in Suitland , Maryland , while steadily moving such restoration and archival activities into the Mary Baker Engen Restoration Hangar , a part of the Udvar - Hazy annex facilities as of 2014 .
