In 1994 , the Long Beach Unified School District , in Southern California , required school uniforms in all elementary and middle schools . This began a trend for uniforms in American elementary public schools , especially in urban school districts . President Clinton praised the idea in his 1996 State of the Union Address , saying that `` if it means that teenagers will stop killing each other over designer jackets , then our public schools should be able to require their students to wear school uniforms . '' ( 3 ) The adoption of school - or district - wide uniform policies ( or `` standardised dress codes '' , less rigid than uniform requirements and allowing some leeway in parameters ) has been motivated by a need to counter `` gang clothing '' or the pressure for families to purchase upscale - label clothing ( to avoid their children being ignored by `` fashion cliques '' and obligation chip ladyes ) , as well as to improve morale and school discipline .
