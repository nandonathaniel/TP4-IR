Darryl McCray , known by his tagging name , `` Cornbread '' , is a graffiti artist from Philadelphia , credited with being the first modern graffiti artist . McCray was born in North Philadelphia in 1953 and raised in Brewerytown , Philadelphia , a neighborhood of North Philadelphia . During the late 1960s , he and a group of friends started `` tagging '' Philadelphia , by writing their nicknames on walls across the city . The movement spread to New York City and blossomed into the modern graffiti movement , which reached its peak in the U.S. in the late 1970s and early 1980s , and then spread to Europe . Since his tagging days , McCray has developed a close relationship with The Philadelphia Mural Arts Program . He is a public speaker and a youth advocate .
