`` Its administration favors the many instead of the few ; this is why it is called a democracy . If we look to the laws , they afford equal justice to all in their private differences ; if no social standing , advancement in public life falls to reputation for capacity , class considerations not being allowed to interfere with merit ; nor again does poverty bar the way , if a man is able to serve the state , he is not hindered by the obscurity of his condition . The freedom which we enjoy in our government extends also to our ordinary life . ''
