Most programming languages in use today allow the direct specification of recursive functions and procedures . When such a function is called , the program 's runtime environment keeps track of the various instances of the function ( often using a call stack , although other methods may be used ) . Every recursive function can be transformed into an iterative function by replacing recursive calls with iterative control constructs and simulating the call stack with a stack explicitly managed by the program .
