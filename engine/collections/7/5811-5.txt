In 1909 , William Howard Taft expanded the building southward , covering the tennis court . He placed the first Oval Office at the center of the addition 's south facade , reminiscent of the oval rooms of the White House . Later , at the outset of his presidency , Herbert Hoover rebuilt the West Wing , excavating a partial basement , and supporting it with structural steel . The completed building lasted less than seven months . On December 24 , 1929 , the West Wing was significantly damaged by an electrical fire . Hoover rebuilt it , and added air - conditioning .
