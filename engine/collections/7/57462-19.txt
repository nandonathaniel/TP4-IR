In 1957 , the Dollanganger family lives an idyllic life in Gladstone , Pennsylvania . After Christopher Sr. , the children 's father , dies in a car accident , his wife Corrine and their four children are left deep in debt . As Corrine has no work skills , the family is forced to move in with her estranged wealthy parents , who live at Foxworth Hall , in Virginia . Corrine explains to the children that she has been estranged from her parents because of something she did when she was 18 . She then adds that their true family name is Foxworth , not Dollanganger . Upon arrival Corrine 's mother , Olivia , sneaks the family into a small bedroom that connects to the attic and insists the children must be hidden from their grandfather . Olivia treats the children with disdain and threatens to severely punish them for any disobedience . Corrine meets with her father , and when she returns to the children , she has been savagely whipped by Olivia , who then tells the children that their parents were half - uncle and niece . Corrine confirms this and explains her plan to win back her father 's love so she can introduce the children to him .
