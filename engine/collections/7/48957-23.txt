Starting out as a seasonal settlement , Timbuktu became a permanent settlement early in the 12th century . After a shift in trading routes , Timbuktu flourished from the trade in salt , gold , ivory and slaves . It became part of the Mali Empire early in the 14th century . In the first half of the 15th century the Tuareg tribes took control of the city for a short period until the expanding Songhai Empire absorbed the city in 1468 . A Moroccan army defeated the Songhai in 1591 , and made Timbuktu , rather than Gao , their capital .
