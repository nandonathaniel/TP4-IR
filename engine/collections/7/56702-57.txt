`` Smells Like Teen Spirit '' uses a `` somewhat conventional formal structure '' consisting of four - , eight - , and twelve - bar sections , including an eight - bar verse , an eight - bar pre-chorus , and a twelve - bar chorus . Musicologist Graeme Downes , who led the band the Verlaines , says that `` Smells Like Teen Spirit '' illustrates developing variation . Elements of the structure are marked with shifts in volume and dynamics , moving from quiet to loud several times . This structure of `` quiet verses with wobbly , chorused guitar , followed by big , loud hardcore - inspired choruses '' became an alternative rock template .
