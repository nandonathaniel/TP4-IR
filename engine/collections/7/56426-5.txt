India is believed to have had a functioning system of higher education as early as 1000 B.C. Unlike present day universities , these ancient learning centers were primarily concerned with dispersing Vedic education . The modern Indian education system finds its roots in colonial legacy . The British Government used the university system as a tool of cultural colonization . Colonial efforts in higher education were carried out initially through the East India Company , followed by the British parliament and later under direct British rule . The first institution of higher learning set up by the British East India Company was the Calcutta Madrasa in 1781 . This was followed by the Asiatic Society of Bengal in 1784 , Benaras Sanskrit College in 1791 and Fort William College in 1800 . With the Charter Act of 1813 , the British Parliament officially declared Indian education as one of the duties of the state . The same act also removed restrictions on missionary work in British India , thus leading to the establishment of the evangelist Serampore College in 1818 . Thomas Babbington Macaulay 's famously controversial Minute on Education ( 1835 ) reflected the growing support of a Western approach to knowledge over an Oriental one . Soon after , in 1857 , the first three official universities were started in Bombay ( Mumbai ) , Calcutta ( Kolkata ) and Madras ( Chennai ) . These universities were modeled after the University of London and focused on English and the humanities
