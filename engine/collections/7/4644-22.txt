The music to `` Man Gave Names to All the Animals '' is reggae - inspired . The lyrics were inspired by the biblical Book of Genesis , verses 2 : 19 -- 20 in which Adam named the animals and birds . The lyrics have an appeal to children , rhyming the name of the animal with one of its characteristics . So after describing an animal 's `` muddy trail '' and `` curly tail , '' Dylan sings that `` he was n't too small and he was n't too big '' and so that animal was named a pig . Similarly , the cow got its name because Adam `` saw milk comin ' out but he did n't know how '' and the bear got its name because it has a `` great big furry back and furry hair . ''
