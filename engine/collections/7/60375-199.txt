The pyramid structure of European leagues means the number of small clubs in the various lower divisions can run into the thousands . The promotion and relegation system which allows transfers between these divisions presents challenges to a cap system . A club that is relegated to a lower league after a poor season may find themselves significantly over the lower division cap . Similarly , a promoted club might have to face the challenge of hastily finding players who it could then pay under a higher cap . A salary cap exacerbates the problem of players switching clubs along with the clubs ' movement between tiers .
