Rise of Islamist `` state - building '' where `` state failure '' has taken place -- most prominently in Syria , Iraq , Libya and Yemen . Islamists have found it easier than competing non-Islamists trying to fill the void of state failure , by securing external funding , weaponry and fighters -- `` many of which have come from abroad and have rallied around a pan-Islamic identity '' . The norms of governance in these Islamist areas are militia - based , and the governed submit to their authority out of fear , loyalty , other reasons , or some combination . The `` most expansive '' of these new `` models '' is the Islamic State .
