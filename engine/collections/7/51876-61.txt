Nate says that the first Dominator invasion occurred in 1951 in Redmond , Oregon . He goes there with fellow Legends Mick Rory and Amaya Jiwe and Felicity and Cisco to kidnap a Dominator for information . Although they are successful , the three Legends and their alien captive are taken prisoner by federal agents . The Legends learn from the Dominator that the aliens have arrived to assess humanity 's threat , now that metahumans have appeared and formed the Justice Society of America . Felicity and Cisco rescue the Legends and help set the Dominator free . In 2016 Central City , the team learns that the Dominators know about Barry 's manipulation of the timeline , deem him a threat , and are demanding his surrender in exchange for peace . After the Legends return , the team discovers that the Dominators ' weapon is a bomb that will kill all metahumans on Earth , with millions of collateral human casualties . The teams dissuade Barry from surrendering , and he and Cisco reconcile ; Cisco realizes that continuing their estrangement would be hypocritical , as Cisco has now also changed the past . Firestorm transmutes the bomb into a liquid , and the teams force the Dominators to retreat with a pain - inflicting nano - weapon developed by Martin 's daughter Lily . As the heroes celebrate their victory , Oliver offers Kara his friendship ; Cisco gives her a device which will enable her to interdimensional travel and communicate between Earth - 1 and Earth - 38 . Martin persuades Jax not to tell the others that Lily 's existence is the result of a temporal paradox he inadvertently caused when the Legends were in 1987 .
