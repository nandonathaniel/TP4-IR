In 2002 , the Discovery Channel produced an episode of the Unsolved History documentaries titled `` Death of the U.S.S. Maine '' that used photographic evidence , naval experts , and archival information to determine the cause of the explosion . Its conclusion was that a coal bunker fire caused the explosion , and it identified a weakness or gap in the bulkhead separating the coal and powder bunkers that allowed the fire to spread from the coal bunker to the powder bunker .
