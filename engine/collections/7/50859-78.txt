In the beginning of the 20th century , the Ottomans embarked on an ambitious project : the construction of a railway connecting Istanbul , the capital of the Ottoman Empire and the seat of the Islamic Caliphate , and Hejaz with its holiest shrines of Islam which are the yearly pilgrimage destination of the Hajj . Another important goal was to improve the economic and political integration of the distant Arabian provinces into the Ottoman state , and to facilitate the transportation of military troops in case of need .
