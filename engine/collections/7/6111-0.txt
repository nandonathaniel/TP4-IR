In Greek mythology , Icarus ( the Latin spelling , conventionally adopted in English ; Ancient Greek : Ἴκαρος , Íkaros , Etruscan : Vikare ) is the son of the master craftsman Daedalus , the creator of the Labyrinth . Often depicted in art , Icarus and his father attempt to escape from Crete by means of wings that his father constructed from feathers and wax . Icarus ' father warns him first of complacency and then of hubris , asking that he fly neither too low nor too high , so the sea 's dampness would not clog his wings or the sun 's heat melt them . Icarus ignored his father 's instructions not to fly too close to the sun ; when the wax in his wings melted he tumbled out of the sky and fell into the sea where he drowned .
