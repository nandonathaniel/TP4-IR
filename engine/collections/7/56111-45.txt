In the United States , automotive insurance covering liability for injuries and property damage is compulsory in most states , but different states enforce the insurance requirement differently . In Virginia , where insurance is not compulsory , residents must pay the state a $500 annual fee per vehicle if they choose not to buy liability insurance . Penalties for not purchasing insurance vary by state , but often include a substantial fine , license and / or registration suspension or revocation , and possible jail time . Usually , the minimum required by law is third party insurance to protect third parties against the financial consequences of loss , damage or injury caused by a vehicle .
