Franco Della Peruta argues in favour of close links between the operas and the Risorgimento , emphasizing Verdi 's patriotic intent and links to the values of the Risorgimento . Verdi started as a republican , became a strong supporter of Cavour and entered the Italian parliament on Cavour 's suggestion . His politics caused him to be frequently in trouble with the Austrian censors . Verdi 's main works of 1842 - 49 were especially relevant to the struggle for independence , including Nabucco ( 1842 ) , I Lombardi alla prima crociata ( 1843 ) , Ernani ( 1844 ) , Attila ( 1846 ) , Macbeth ( 1847 ) , and La battaglia di Legnano ( 1848 ) . However , starting in the 1850s , his operas showed few patriotic themes because of the heavy censorship of the absolutist regimes in power .
