The Impeachment of Andrew Johnson occurred in 1868 , when the United States House of Representatives resolved to impeach President Andrew Johnson , adopting eleven articles of impeachment detailing his `` high crimes and misdemeanors , '' in accordance with Article Two of the United States Constitution . The House 's primary charge against Johnson was violation of the Tenure of Office Act , passed by the U.S. Congress in March 1867 , over the president 's veto . Specifically , he had removed from office Edwin M. Stanton , the Secretary of War -- whom the Act was largely designed to protect -- and attempted to replace him with Brevet Major General Lorenzo Thomas ( Earlier , while Congress was not in session , Johnson had suspended Stanton and appointed General Ulysses S. Grant as secretary of war ad interim ) .
