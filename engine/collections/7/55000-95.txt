`` Berufsakademien '' have four quarters , January to March and so on . In alternating quarters the students attend the university and intern at the employer ( the latter being the `` Praxisphase '' ) . The number of lessons per week is significantly higher than at normal universities ( equivalent to a full - time job ) and the exams can not be during the `` free time '' of the year , as that time is spent in the company . Vacation is given according to labor laws , i.e. half of 20 -- 30 days ( because only half of the year is worked ) .
