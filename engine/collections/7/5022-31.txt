On Unix - like systems , the list of authorized public keys is typically stored in the home directory of the user that is allowed to log in remotely , in the file ~ /. ssh / authorized_keys . This file is respected by SSH only if it is not writable by anything apart from the owner and root . When the public key is present on the remote end and the matching private key is present on the local end , typing in the password is no longer required ( some software like Message Passing Interface ( MPI ) stack may need this password-less access to run properly ) . However , for additional security the private key itself can be locked with a passphrase .
