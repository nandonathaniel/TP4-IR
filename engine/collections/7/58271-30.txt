One aspect of death was the disintegration of the various kheperu , or modes of existence . Funerary rituals served to re-integrate these different aspects of being . Mummification served to preserve and transform the physical body into sah , an idealised form with divine aspects ; the Book of the Dead contained spells aimed at preserving the body of the deceased , which may have been recited during the process of mummification . The heart , which was regarded as the aspect of being which included intelligence and memory , was also protected with spells , and in case anything happened to the physical heart , it was common to bury jewelled heart scarabs with a body to provide a replacement . The ka , or life - force , remained in the tomb with the dead body , and required sustenance from offerings of food , water and incense . In case priests or relatives failed to provide these offerings , Spell 105 ensured the ka was satisfied . The name of the dead person , which constituted their individuality and was required for their continued existence , was written in many places throughout the Book , and spell 25 ensured the deceased would remember their own name . The ba was a free - ranging spirit aspect of the deceased . It was the ba , depicted as a human - headed bird , which could `` go forth by day '' from the tomb into the world ; spells 61 and 89 acted to preserve it . Finally , the shut , or shadow of the deceased , was preserved by spells 91 , 92 and 188 . If all these aspects of the person could be variously preserved , remembered , and satiated , then the dead person would live on in the form of an akh . An akh was a blessed spirit with magical powers who would dwell among the gods .
