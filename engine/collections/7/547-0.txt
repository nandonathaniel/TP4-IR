This is a list of host cities of the Olympic Games , both summer and winter , since the modern Olympics began in 1896 . Since then , summer games have usually -- but not always -- celebrated a four - year period known as an Olympiad . There have been 28 Summer Olympic Games held in 23 cities , and 23 Winter Olympic Games held in 20 cities . In addition , three summer and two winter editions of the Games were scheduled to take place but later cancelled due to war : Berlin ( summer ) in 1916 ; Tokyo / Helsinki ( summer ) and Sapporo / Garmisch - Partenkirchen ( winter ) in 1940 ; and London ( summer ) and Cortina d'Ampezzo , Italy ( winter ) in 1944 . The 1906 Summer Olympics were officially sanctioned and held in Athens . However , in 1949 , the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) , decided to unrecognize the 1906 Games . Four cities have been chosen by the IOC to host upcoming Olympic Games : Tokyo for the 2020 Summer Olympics , Beijing for the 2022 Winter Olympics , Paris for the 2024 Summer Olympics , and Los Angeles for the 2028 Summer Olympics .
