In September 2015 , Michelle Murdocca , the film 's producer , said before the second film 's release that the studio was `` talking about number 3 and moving forward and taking the franchise to the next level , '' but thought that she and director Genndy Tartakovsky would not return , since they were working on Tartakovsky 's Can You Imagine ? before that project was later shelved . That same month , Tartakovsky stated that he will not return for the sequel , specifying to TheWrap that `` two is enough . I have a lot of other ideas , and I kind of have to express them and have them come out . '' In November 2015 , Sony Pictures Animation announced that the third film , under the tentative title of Hotel Transylvania 3 , had been set for release on September 21 , 2018 .
