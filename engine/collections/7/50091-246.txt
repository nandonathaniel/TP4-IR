Leedsichthys Along with its close pachycormid relatives Bonnerichthys and Rhinconichthys , Leedsichthys is part of a lineage of large - sized filter - feeders that swam the Mesozoic seas for over 100 million years , from the middle Jurassic until the end of the Cretaceous period . Pachycormids might represent an early branch of Teleostei , the group most modern bony fishes belong to ; in that case Leedsichthys is the largest known teleost fish . In 2003 , a fossil specimen 22 meters ( 72 feet ) long was unearthed .
