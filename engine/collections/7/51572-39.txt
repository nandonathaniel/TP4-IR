The Edict of Caracalla ( officially the Constitutio Antoniniana ( Latin : `` Constitution ( or Edict ) of Antoninus '' ) was an edict issued in AD 212 by the Roman Emperor Caracalla , which declared that all free men in the Roman Empire were to be given full Roman citizenship and all free women in the Empire were given the same rights as Roman women . Before 212 , for the most part only inhabitants of Italia held full Roman citizenship . Colonies of Romans established in other provinces , Romans ( or their descendants ) living in provinces , the inhabitants of various cities throughout the Empire , and a few local nobles ( such as kings of client countries ) also held full citizenship . Provincials , on the other hand , were usually non-citizens , although some held the Latin Right .
