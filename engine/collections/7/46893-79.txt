The classic Fran√ßois - Louis Ganshof version of feudalism describes a set of reciprocal legal and military obligations among the warrior nobility , revolving around the three key concepts of lords , vassals and fiefs . A lord was in broad terms a noble who held land , a vassal was a person who was granted possession of the land by the lord , and the land was known as a fief . In exchange for the use of the fief and the protection of the lord , the vassal would provide some sort of service to the lord . There were many varieties of feudal land tenure , consisting of military and non-military service . The obligations and corresponding rights between lord and vassal concerning the fief form the basis of the feudal relationship .
