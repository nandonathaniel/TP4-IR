In October 2011 , the new premier , Barry O'Farrell , announced that the governor , now Dame Marie Bashir , had agreed with O'Farrell's offer to move back into Government House : `` A lot of people believe the Governor should live at Government House . That 's what it was built for ... ( A ) t some stage a rural or regional governor will be appointed and we will need to provide accommodation at Government House so it makes sense to provide appropriate living areas '' . With the Governor 's return , management of the residence reverted to the Office of the Governor in December 2013 .
