Alternative possibilities include moving from Stamford Bridge to a location such as the Earls Court Exhibition Centre , White City , Battersea Power Station , the Imperial Road Gasworks ( off the Kings Road on the Fulham and Chelsea border ) and the Chelsea Barracks . But , under the Chelsea Pitch Owners articles of association , the club would relinquish the name ' Chelsea Football Club ' should it ever move from Stamford Bridge . On 3 October 2011 , the club issued a statement , in which it proposed to buy back the freehold from Chelsea Pitch Owners Plc . This has been widely speculated as the first move by the football club to begin their movement away from the current stadium . On 27 October 2011 , Chelsea F.C. failed in its bid to buy back the freehold , with shareholders of the CPO voting against selling the land . On 4 May 2012 , Chelsea F.C. announced a bid to purchase Battersea Power Station , as part of plans to build a new 60,000 - seater stadium on the site . Though they were not the preferred bidders , they released artistic impressions of the proposed stadium at the BPS on 22 June 2012 .
