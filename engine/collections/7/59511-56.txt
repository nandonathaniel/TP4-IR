The Butler Act was also an historic compromise between church and state . Three new categories of schools were created . The first were Voluntary Controlled schools whose costs were met by the State , and would be controlled by the local education authority . The school kept the title deeds to the land , but taught an agreed religious education syllabus . These schools were favoured by the Anglicans : over half their schools chose this status , and were soon effectively absorbed into the state system . The second were Voluntary Aided schools , which retained greater influence over school admission policies , staffing and curriculum , and which were preferred by the Roman Catholics and by some Anglican schools . They would have all of their running costs met by the State , but their capital costs would only be 50 % state funded ( later increased to 75 % by the Education Act 1959 , and now 90 % ) . The third were Direct Grant Schools : former independent schools , often town grammar schools and predominantly in the north of England , who accepted a state grant in return for providing free education to many students but still charging for others . The state had little control on syllabus or admissions policy . The schools kept their title deeds .
