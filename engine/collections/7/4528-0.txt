`` Crossing the Bar '' is an 1889 poem by Alfred , Lord Tennyson . It is considered that Tennyson wrote it in elegy ; the poem has a tone of finality and the narrator uses an extended metaphor to compare death with crossing the `` sandbar '' between river of life , with its outgoing `` flood '' , and the ocean that lies beyond ( death ) , the `` boundless deep '' , to which we return .
