Since 2008 , a former Kansas State University food safety professor has accused Chipotle of confusing the public by using such terms as `` naturally raised meats '' , `` organic ingredients '' , and `` locally sourced '' and trying to equate those terms with food safety . In rebuttal , a Chipotle spokesperson told The Daily Beast that `` all of our practices have always been very much within industry norms . It 's important to note that restaurant practices are regulated by health codes , and restaurants are routinely inspected by health officials . Everything we have done in our supply chain and in our restaurants has been within industry norms . '' Yet , FiveThirtyEight pointed out that the 2015 norovirus outbreak appears to be unusual and others are criticizing their food sourcing or handling practices . MarketWatch wrote that the result of all of these outbreaks will be to force Chipotle to obtain their produce from larger corporate farms that can afford the more extensive microbial food - safety testing programs and to process vegetables at centralized locations instead of at the individual stores , both of which are industry - standard practices that the company had previously criticized . The New York Times implied that the company 's insistence on maintaining its long standing rhetoric about `` food integrity '' seemed to be quite opposite with the realities of recent current events and made it appear that the management was just ignoring their current problems . It also has been pointed out that Chipotle 's current record - keeping system is actually hindering the health authorities ' investigation in locating the sources of the various infections .
