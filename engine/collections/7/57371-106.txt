On October 25 , 1836 , construction began on the Wilmington and Raleigh Railroad to connect the port city of Wilmington with the state capital of Raleigh . In 1849 the North Carolina Railroad was created by act of the legislature to extend that railroad west to Greensboro , High Point , and Charlotte . During the Civil War , the Wilmington - to - Raleigh stretch of the railroad would be vital to the Confederate war effort ; supplies shipped into Wilmington would be moved by rail through Raleigh to the Confederate capital of Richmond , Virginia .
