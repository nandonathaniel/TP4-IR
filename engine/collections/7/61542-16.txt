In 2002 , Wolfgang Petersen was set to direct a Batman vs. Superman film from a script by Akiva Goldsman . Warner Bros. canceled development to focus on individual Superman and Batman projects after J.J. Abrams submitted another draft for Superman : Flyby . In February 2007 , Warner Bros. hired husband and wife duo Michele and Kieran Mulroney to write a script for a Justice League film . Christian Bale , who starred as Batman in Batman Begins ( 2005 ) , was not approached to reprise the role , nor was Brandon Routh , who starred as Superman in Superman Returns ( 2006 ) . George Miller was hired to direct the film , reportedly titled Justice League Mortal , with Armie Hammer cast as Batman , D.J. Cotrona as Superman , Adam Brody as Flash , Santiago Cabrera as Aquaman , Common as Green Lantern , Megan Gale as Wonder Woman , Hugh Keays - Byrne as Martian Manhunter and Jay Baruchel as Maxwell Lord . The project was put on indefinite hold in January 2008 , after failing to secure tax breaks for filming in Australia , as well as the 2007 -- 2008 Writers Guild of America strike preventing progress on the script .
