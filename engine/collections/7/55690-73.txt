In May , General Nivelle , who had taken over the Second Army , ordered General Charles Mangin , commander of the 5th Division to plan a counter-attack on Fort Douaumont . The initial plan was for an attack on a 3 km ( 1.9 mi ) front but several minor German attacks captured Fausse - Côte and Couleuvre ravines on the south - east and west sides of the fort . A further attack took the ridge south of the ravin de Couleuvre , which gave the Germans better routes for counter-attacks and observation over the French lines to the south and south - west . Mangin proposed a preliminary attack to retake the area of the ravines , to obstruct the routes by which a German counter-attack on the fort could be made . More divisions were necessary but these were refused , to preserve the troops needed for the forthcoming offensive on the Somme ; Mangin was limited to one division for the attack with one in reserve . Nivelle reduced the attack to an assault on Morchée Trench , Bonnet - d'Evèque , Fontaine Trench , Fort Douaumont , a machine - gun turret and Hongrois Trench , which would require an advance of 500 m ( 550 yd ) on a 1,150 m ( 1,260 yd ) front .
