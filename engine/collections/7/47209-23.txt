After the program is over , the adults celebrate Dan Hollis ' birthday . He gets two presents from his wife : a bottle of brandy -- which is one of only five left in the village -- and a Perry Como record . Dan is eager to listen to the record , but he 's reminded by everyone that Anthony does not like singing and he must listen to it at home . Getting drunk from the brandy , he starts complaining about the miserable state of the town , not listening to the record , and no one singing `` Happy Birthday '' to him . Anthony at first ignores him after telling him to be quiet . Dan eventually snaps with repressed rage surfacing and confronts the child , calling him a monster and a murderer . While Anthony 's anger grows , Dan yells for someone to attack Anthony from behind and end his reign of terror . Aunt Amy ( who is n't able to sing anymore because of Anthony ) tentatively reaches for a fireplace poker , but no one has the courage to act . Anthony transforms Dan into a jack - in - the - box , causing his wife to break down . The adults are horrified at what Anthony had done , and his father asks him to wish it into the cornfield , which he does .
