An ice - cream headache , also known as brain freeze , cold - stimulus headache , trigeminal headache or its given scientific name sphenopalatine ganglioneuralgia ( meaning `` pain of the sphenopalatine ganglion '' ) , is a form of brief pain or headache commonly associated with consumption ( particularly quick consumption ) of cold beverages or foods such as ice cream and ice pops . It is caused by having something cold touch the roof of the mouth , and is believed to result from a nerve response causing rapid constriction and swelling of blood vessels or a `` referring '' of pain from the roof of the mouth to the head . The rate of intake for cold foods has been studied as a contributing factor . Ice - cream headache is distinct from dentin hypersensitivity , a type of pain that can occur under similar circumstances .
