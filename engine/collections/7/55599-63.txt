On 20 July 1851 gold was found near present - day Castlemaine , Victoria ( Mt Alexander Goldfields ) at Specimen Gully in today 's Castlemaine suburb of Barkers Creek . The gold was first found by Christopher Thomas Peters , a shepherd and hut - keeper on the Barker 's Creek , in the service of William Barker . When the gold was shown in the men 's quarters Peters was ridiculed for finding fool 's gold , and the gold was thrown away . Barker did not want his workmen to abandon his sheep , but in August they did just that . John Worley , George Robinson and Robert Keen , also in the employ of Barker as shepherds and a bullock driver , immediately teamed with Peters in working the deposits by panning in Specimen Gully , which they did in relative privacy during the next month . When Barker sacked them and ran them off for trespass , Worley , on behalf of the party `` to prevent them getting in trouble '' , mailed a letter to The Argus ( Melbourne ) dated 1 September 1851 announcing this new goldfield with the precise location of their workings . This letter was published on 8 September 1851 . `` With this obsure notice , rendered still more so by the journalist as ' Western Port ' , were ushered to the world the inexhaustible treasures of Mount Alexander '' , also to become known as the Forest Creek diggings . Within a month there were about 8,000 diggers working the alluvial beds of the creeks near the present day town of Castlemaine , and particularly Forest Creek which runs through the suburb today known as Chewton where the first small township was established . By the end of the year there were about 25,000 on the field .
