Boulder 's Climate Action Plan ( CAP ) tax is expected to raise $1.6 million in 2010 . The tax was increased to a maximum allowable rate by voters in 2009 to meet CAP goals . Currently the tax is set at $0.0049 / kWh for residential users ( ave . $21 per year ) , $0.0009 / kWh for commercial ( ave . $94 per year ) , and $0.0003 / kWh for industrial ( ave . $9,600 per year ) . The revenues from the tax are expected to decrease over time as businesses and residents reduce their energy use and begin to use more solar and wind power . The tax was renewed by voters on November 6 , 2012 .
