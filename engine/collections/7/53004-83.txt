`` What ? Why ? What of it ? '' is a plan of study of alliterative methods for the teacher emphasized by Professor W.C. Wilkinson not as original with himself but as of venerable authority . `` It is , in fact , '' he says , `` an almost immemorial orator 's analysis . First the facts , next the proof of the facts , then the consequences of the facts . This analysis has often been expanded into one known as `` The Five Ws : '' `` When ? Where ? Who ? What ? Why ? '' Hereby attention is called , in the study of any lesson : to the date of its incidents ; to their place or locality ; to the person speaking or spoken to , or to the persons introduced , in the narrative ; to the incidents or statements of the text ; and , finally , to the applications and uses of the lesson teachings .
