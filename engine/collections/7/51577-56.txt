For regular polygons with side s = 1 , circumradius R = 1 , or apothem a = 1 , this produces the following table : ( Note that since cot ⁡ x → 1 / x ( \ displaystyle \ cot x \ rightarrow 1 / x ) as x → 0 ( \ displaystyle x \ rightarrow 0 ) , the area when s = 1 ( \ displaystyle s = 1 ) is tending to n 2 / 4 π ( \ displaystyle n ^ ( 2 ) / 4 \ pi ) as n ( \ displaystyle n ) grows large . )
