In 1926 , Mark C Lidwill of the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital of Sydney , supported by physicist Edgar H. Booth of the University of Sydney , devised a portable apparatus which `` plugged into a lighting point '' and in which `` One pole was applied to a skin pad soaked in strong salt solution '' while the other pole `` consisted of a needle insulated except at its point , and was plunged into the appropriate cardiac chamber '' . `` The pacemaker rate was variable from about 80 to 120 pulses per minute , and likewise the voltage variable from 1.5 to 120 volts '' . In 1928 , the apparatus was used to revive a stillborn infant at Crown Street Women 's Hospital , Sydney whose heart continued `` to beat on its own accord '' , `` at the end of 10 minutes '' of stimulation .
