301 Mission Street is a development in the South of Market district of downtown San Francisco . A mixed - use , primarily residential development , it has the tallest residential building in San Francisco . The blue - gray glass , late - modernist buildings are bounded by Mission , Fremont , and Beale Streets , and the north end of the Transbay Transit Center site . Opened to residents on April 23 , 2009 , 301 Mission includes two buildings : a 12 - story tower located on the northeast of the property , and Millennium Tower , a 58 - story , 645 - foot - tall ( 197 m ) condominium skyscraper . The mixed - use , primarily residential structure is the tallest residential building in San Francisco . In total , the project has 419 residential units , with 53 of those units in the smaller tower . The tower 's highest level , 58 floors above the ground , is listed as the 60th , because floors 13 and 44 are missing for superstitious reasons . The French restaurant and wine bar RN74 is housed on the ground floor of the skyscraper . Resident services include a private concierge and access to the 20,000 - square - foot ( 1,900 m ) Owner 's Club Level , which features amenities such as a private lounge , wine cellar , and fitness center . The development 's `` lifestyle '' program organizes cultural events . In May 2016 , residents were informed the main tower was both sinking and tilting , resulting in several lawsuits concerning repair costs and whether the tilt had been withheld from buyers .
