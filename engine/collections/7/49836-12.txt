Arranged marriages vary widely by region and community across the Indian subcontinent . The marriage process usually begin with a realization in the family that a child is old enough to marry . For a girl , it is during her graduation or early twenties ; for a boy , it is after he is ' settled ' , with a decent job and consistent earnings . The initiation can occur when a parent or a relative ( such as an aunt or an elder sister or sister - in - law ) initiates a conversation on the topic or the son / daughter approaches the parent / relative and expresses the desire to be married . This relative effectively acts as a sponsor , taking responsibility to get the boy / girl married to a good partner .
