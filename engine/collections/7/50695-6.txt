The articular cartilage function is dependent on the molecular composition of the extracellular matrix ( ECM ) . The ECM consists mainly of proteoglycan and collagens . The main proteoglycan in cartilage is aggrecan , which , as its name suggests , forms large aggregates with hyaluronan . These aggregates are negatively charged and hold water in the tissue . The collagen , mostly collagen type II , constrains the proteoglycans . The ECM responds to tensile and compressive forces that are experienced by the cartilage . Cartilage growth thus refers to the matrix deposition , but can also refer to both the growth and remodeling of the extracellular matrix . Due to the great stress on the patellofemoral joint during resisted knee extension , the articular cartilage of the patella is among the thickest in the human body .
