The anaerobic environment and presence of tannic acids within bogs can result in the remarkable preservation of organic material . Finds of such material have been made in Denmark , Germany , Ireland , Russia , and the United Kingdom . Some bogs have preserved bog - wood such as ancient oak logs useful in dendrochronology , and they have yielded extremely well preserved bog bodies , with hair , organs , and skin intact , buried there thousands of years ago after apparent Germanic and Celtic human sacrifice . Excellent examples of such human specimens are Haraldskær Woman and Tollund Man in Denmark , and Lindow man found at Lindow Common in England . At Céide Fields in County Mayo in Ireland , a 5,000 - year - old neolithic farming landscape has been found preserved under a blanket bog , complete with field walls and hut sites . One ancient artifact found in bogs in many places is bog butter , large masses of fat , usually in wooden containers . These are thought to have been food stores , of both butter and tallow .
