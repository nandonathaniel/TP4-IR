As Chicano studies programs began to be implemented at universities , it was necessary to provide infrastructure and support . In 1973 , the University of California , Berkeley recognized the need to provide quality library materials to support the Chicano studies programs . Chicano scholars also recognized the need to have a `` Chicano - controlled academic '' space . Researchers began to study the impact that these new programs had on students , finding that Mexican - American students responded positively to Chicano studies and also to bilingual classes . Many scholars felt that the philosophy of education in the United States at the time was `` inconsistent with the values of the Chicano movement '' and that Chicano studies needed to create tools for students to use in the real world and also a new type of research to solve problems . It was also important to find ways to recruit Chicano teachers and administration within the schools to support students and research . Further support for Chicano studies came in the form of the National Association for Chicana and Chicano Studies ( NACCS ) which was created in 1972 in San Antonio , Texas . The NACCS allows scholars in Chicano studies to exchange ideas , share research , communicate and it also has an annual conference . The conferences were important to help bring together scholars and legitimize Chicano studies , since other disciplines have similar annual conferences .
