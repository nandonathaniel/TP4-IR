Although John Wycliffe is often credited with the first translation of the Bible into English , there were , in fact , many translations of large parts of the Bible centuries before Wycliffe 's work . The English Bible was first translated from the Latin Vulgate into Old English by a few select monks and scholars . Such translations were generally in the form of prose or as interlinear glosses ( literal translations above the Latin words ) . Very few complete translations existed during that time . Rather , most of the books of the Bible existed separately and were read as individual texts . Thus , the sense of the Bible as history that often exists today did not exist at that time . Instead , an allegorical rendering of the Bible was more common and translations of the Bible often included the writer 's own commentary on passages in addition to the literal translation .
