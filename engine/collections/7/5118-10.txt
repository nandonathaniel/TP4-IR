Dormish Khan Shamlu , brother - in - law of Ismail , partially compensated for this lack of construction beginning in 1503 . This governor of Isfahan , who lived more often at the court of Tabriz than in his city , left the reins to Mirza Shah Hussein Isfahani , the greatest architect of the period , who built there in particular the tomb of Harun - e Vilayat in 1512 - 1513 . Described by a western traveller as a great place of `` Persian pilgrimage '' ( as much for Muslims as for Jews and Christians ) , this monument is composed of a square chamber under a cupola , a completely traditional design . The cupola rests on a high drum , the muqarnas filling the octagonal passageway . Two minarets , now gone , magnified the great porch , while the decor of hazerbaf and the ceramic mosaic , concentrated on the facade , stayed in the Timurid tradition . The facade , punctuated by blind arches , is thus unified by basic decor , as was already the case at the mosque of Yazd . One must add to this tomb the nearby mosque masjed - e Ali , completed in 1522 under the order of the same commander .
