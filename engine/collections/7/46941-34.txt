The massively acclaimed single features many of the conventional topics found in the gangsta rap genre , as Snoop Doggy Dogg , with the laconic , laid - back drawl he became famous for , raps about his involvement with gang crime , killing , drugs , parties , sex and black - on - black shootings . However , the song adopts a more ' funky ' tune , ( as seen across much of Snoop and Dr. Dre 's earlier work ) . The single quickly became a hugely successful hit , and is recognised as one of Snoop Dogg 's `` greatest pieces '' .
