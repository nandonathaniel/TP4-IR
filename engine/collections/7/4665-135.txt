In 1871 A.D. Pt . Buddhiballav Pant opened a debating club . When Sir William Muir , the then provincial Governor , came here he was highly pleased with the working of this club . It is said that he also advised to open a press here and publish a newspaper . Mr. Pant , as advised , opened a press here and started publishing a weekly magazine Almora Akhbar . Almora Akhbar was the oldest Hindi weekly of this province . In 1913 A.D. Badri Datt Pandey took over the editing work of the magazine . Almora Akhbar made much progress ; The number of its customers rose from 50 - 60 to 1500 ; however , it was closed in 1917 . In 1918 one of the partners purchased the Debating Club Press and named it Vindhyavasini Press . From 1922 A.D. a weekly named Zila Samachar began to be published . Later on it came to be called Kumaun Kumud and was still being published till the late 30 's .
