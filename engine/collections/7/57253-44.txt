The 1899 Cleveland Spiders currently hold the MLB record for the most road losses in a single season , with 101 . This record is unusual compared to others on this list in that while most others are theoretically possible ( but impractical ) to break , this record of most road losses mathematically can not be broken even if a team achieved a completely winless road record : scheduling has since been standardized so that each team is scheduled to play exactly 81 games as a designated home team and 81 games as a designated away team , 21 games fewer than necessary to break the record .
