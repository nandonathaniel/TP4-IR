The box office performance of these last few films were disappointing - especially Sergeant Deadhead , for which sequels had been planned . More popular was Dr. Goldfoot and the Bikini Machine ( 1965 ) , a comedy with Vincent Price and Hickman , for AIP . This was liked enough to justify a sequel , although Avalon did not appear , Fabian Forte taking over .
