Coffee may be brewed by several methods . It may be boiled , steeped , or pressurized . Brewing coffee by boiling was the earliest method , and Turkish coffee is an example of this method . It is prepared by grinding or pounding the seeds to a fine powder , then adding it to water and bringing it to the boil for no more than an instant in a pot called a cezve or , in Greek , a br√≠ki . This produces a strong coffee with a layer of foam on the surface and sediment ( which is not meant for drinking ) settling at the bottom of the cup .
