The Harrapans spoke an unknown language and their script has not yet been deciphered . It is believed to have had about 400 basic signs , with many variations . The signs may have stood both for words and for syllables . The direction of the writing was generally from right to left . Most of the inscriptions are found on seals ( mostly made out of stone ) and sealings ( pieces of clay on which the seal was pressed down to leave its impression ) . Some inscriptions are also found on copper tablets , bronze implements , and small objects made of terracotta , stone and faience . The seals may have been used in trade and also for official administrative work . A lot of inscribed material was found at Mohenjo - daro and other Indus Valley Civilisation sites .
