The war began when Iraq invaded Iran , launching a simultaneous invasion by air and land into Iranian territory on 22 September 1980 , following a long history of border disputes , and fears of Shia insurgency among Iraq 's long - suppressed Shia majority influenced by the Iranian Revolution . Iraq was also aiming to replace Iran as the dominant Persian Gulf state . The United States supported Saddam Hussein in the war against Iran . Although Iraq hoped to take advantage of the revolutionary chaos in Iran and attacked without formal warning , they made only limited progress into Iran and within several months were repelled by the Iranians who regained virtually all lost territory by June 1982 . For the next six years , Iran was on the offensive . Despite calls for a ceasefire by the United Nations Security Council , hostilities continued until 20 August 1988 . The war finally ended with a United Nations brokered ceasefire in the form of United Nations Security Council Resolution 598 , which was accepted by both sides . It took several weeks for the Iranian armed forces to evacuate Iraqi territory to honor pre-war international borders between the two nations ( see 1975 Algiers Agreement ) . The last prisoners of war were exchanged in 2003 .
