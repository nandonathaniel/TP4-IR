Here is the idolized flag , the flag that Belgrano left to us , when the sad enslaved Homeland bravely broke its bonds . Here is the splendorous flag that surprised the world with its victory , when arrogant and victoriously during the battles the top of the Andes it has climbed . Here is the flag that one day triumphantly rose in the middle of the battle and , full of pride and gallantry , to San Lorenzo it went immortal . Here it is , like the shining sky , showing sublimate majesty after having crossed the continent shouting in its way : `` Freedom ! '' `` Freedom ! Freedom ! ''
