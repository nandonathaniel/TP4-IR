Later in the morning , Ike picked up his rifle and revolver from the West End Corral , where he had deposited his weapons and stabled his wagon and team after entering town . By noon that day , Ike was still drinking and once again armed , in violation of the city ordinance against carrying firearms in the city . He told others he was looking for Holliday or an Earp . At about 1 : 00 pm , Virgil and Morgan Earp surprised Ike on 4th Street where Virgil pistol whipped him from behind . Disarming him , the Earps took Ike to appear before Judge Wallace for violating the ordinance . Wyatt waited with Clanton while Virgil went to find Judge Wallace so the court hearing could be held .
