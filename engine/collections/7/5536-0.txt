In rugby union a scrum is a means of restarting play after a minor infringement . It involves up to eight players from each team , known as the pack or forward pack , binding together in three rows and interlocking with the free opposing teams forwards . At this point the ball is fed into the gap between the two forward packs and they both compete for the ball to win possession . Teams can be penalised for intentionally causing the scrum to collapse , and for not putting the ball into the scrum correctly . A scrum is most commonly awarded when the ball is knocked forward , or passed forward , or when a ball becomes trapped in a ruck or maul . Because of the physical nature of scrums , injuries can occur , especially in the front row .
