The credit manager called Paul Terrell , who was attending an IEEE computer conference at Asilomar in Pacific Grove , and verified the validity of the purchase order . Amazed at the tenacity of Jobs , Terrell assured the credit manager if the computers showed up in his stores , Jobs would be paid and would have more than enough money to pay for the parts order . The two Steves and their small crew spent day and night building and testing the computers , and delivered to Terrell on time to pay his suppliers and have a tidy profit left over for their celebration and next order . Steve Jobs had found a way to finance his soon - to - be multimillion - dollar company without giving away one share of stock or ownership .
