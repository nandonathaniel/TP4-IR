Faced with the growing threat of piracy , in 1564 the Spanish adopted a convoy system far ahead of its time , with treasure fleets leaving America in April and August . The policy proved efficient , and was quite successful . Only two convoys were captured ; one in 1628 when it was captured by the Dutch , and another in 1656 , captured by the English , but by then the convoys were a shadow of what they had been at their peak at the end of the previous century . Nevertheless , even without being completely captured they frequently came under attack , which inevitably took its toll . Not all shipping of the dispersed empire could be protected by large convoys , allowing the Dutch , English and French privateers and pirates the opportunity to attack trade along the American and Spanish coastlines and raid isolated settlements . This became particularly savage from the 1650s , with all sides falling to extraordinary levels of barbarity , even by the harsh standards of the time . Spain also responded with no small amount of privateering , using the recaptured city of Dunkirk as a base for its Dunkirk Raiders to molest Dutch , English and French trade . More seriously , the Portuguese part of the empire , with its chronically undermanned African and Asian forts , proved nearly impossible to defend adequately , and with Spain so fully engaged on so many fronts , it could spare little for their defense . Spain also had to deal with Ottoman backed Barbary piracy in the Mediterranean - a vastly greater menace than Caribbean piracy , as well as Oriental and Dutch piracy in the waters around the Philippines .
