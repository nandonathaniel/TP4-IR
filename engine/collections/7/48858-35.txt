When asked before publication about the forthcoming book , Rowling stated that she could not change the ending even if she wanted . `` These books have been plotted for such a long time , and for six books now , that they 're all leading a certain direction . So , I really ca n't '' . She also commented that the final volume related closely to the previous book in the series , Harry Potter and the Half - Blood Prince , `` almost as though they are two - halves of the same novel '' . She has said that the last chapter of the book was written `` in something like 1990 '' , as part of her earliest work on the series . Rowling also revealed she originally wrote the last words to be `` something like : ' Only those who he loved could see his lightning scar ' '' . Rowling changed this because she did not want people to think Voldemort would rise again and to say that Harry 's mission was over .
