Sound further tightened the grip of major studios in numerous countries : the vast expense of the transition overwhelmed smaller competitors , while the novelty of sound lured vastly larger audiences for those producers that remained . In the case of the U.S. , some historians credit sound with saving the Hollywood studio system in the face of the Great Depression ( Parkinson , 1995 ) . Thus began what is now often called `` The Golden Age of Hollywood '' , which refers roughly to the period beginning with the introduction of sound until the late 1940s . The American cinema reached its peak of efficiently manufactured glamour and global appeal during this period . The top actors of the era are now thought of as the classic film stars , such as Clark Gable , Katharine Hepburn , Humphrey Bogart , Greta Garbo , and the greatest box office draw of the 1930s , child performer Shirley Temple .
