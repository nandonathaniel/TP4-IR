Going higher in elevation , the coniferous forests become purer stands of red fir , western white pine , Jeffrey pine , lodgepole pine , and the occasional foxtail pine . Fewer wildlife species tend to be found in these habitats , because of their higher elevation and lower complexity . Species likely to be found include golden - mantled ground squirrel , chickaree , fisher , Steller 's jay , hermit thrush , and northern goshawk . Reptiles are not common , but include rubber boa , western fence lizard , and northern alligator lizard .
