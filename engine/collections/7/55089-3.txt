According to George Macaulay Trevelyan in A Shortened History of England ( 1958 ) , during the Viking occupation : `` The Scandinavians , when not on the Viking warpath , were a litigious people and loved to get together in the ' thing ' to hear legal argument . They had no professional lawyers , but many of their farmer - warriors , like Njal , the truth - teller , were learned in folk custom and in its intricate judicial procedure . A Danish town in England often had , as its principal officers , twelve hereditary ' law men ' . The Danes introduced the habit of making committees among the free men in court , which perhaps made England favorable ground for the future growth of the jury system out of a Frankish custom later introduced by the Normans .
