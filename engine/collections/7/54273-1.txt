The experiments began in July 1961 , in the basement of Linsly - Chittenden Hall at Yale University , three months after the start of the trial of German Nazi war criminal Adolf Eichmann in Jerusalem . Milgram devised his psychological study to answer the popular question at that particular time : `` Could it be that Eichmann and his million accomplices in the Holocaust were just following orders ? Could we call them all accomplices ? '' The experiments have been repeated many times in the following years with consistent results within differing societies , although not with the same percentages around the globe .
