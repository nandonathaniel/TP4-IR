Other studies have shown that a high resting heart rate is associated with an increase in cardiovascular and all - cause mortality in the general population and in patients with chronic disease . A faster resting heart rate is associated with shorter life expectancy and is considered a strong risk factor for heart disease and heart failure , independent of level of physical fitness . Specifically , a resting heart rate above 65 beats per minute has been shown to have a strong independent effect on premature mortality ; every 10 beats per minute increase in resting heart rate has been shown to be associated with a 10 -- 20 % increase in risk of death . In one study , men with no evidence of heart disease and a resting heart rate of more than 90 beats per minute had a five times higher risk of sudden cardiac death . Similarly , another study found that men with resting heart rates of over 90 beats per minute had an almost two-fold increase in risk for cardiovascular disease mortality ; in women it was associated with a three-fold increase .
