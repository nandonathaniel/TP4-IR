Seven pinniped species inhabit Antarctica . The largest , the elephant seal ( Mirounga leonina ) , can reach up to 4,000 kilograms ( 8,818 lb ) , while females of the smallest , the Antarctic fur seal ( Arctocephalus gazella ) , reach only 150 kilograms ( 331 lb ) . These two species live north of the sea ice , and breed in harems on beaches . The other four species can live on the sea ice . Crabeater seals ( Lobodon carcinophagus ) and Weddell seals ( Leptonychotes weddellii ) form breeding colonies , whereas leopard seals ( Hydrurga leptonyx ) and Ross seals ( Ommatophoca rossii ) live solitary lives . Although these species hunt underwater , they breed on land or ice and spend a great deal of time there , as they have no terrestrial predators .
