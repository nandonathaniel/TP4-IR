An inverter can be used to control the speed of the compressor motor to drive variable refrigerant flow in a refrigeration or air conditioning system to regulate system performance . Such installations are known as inverter compressors . Traditional methods of refrigeration regulation use single - speed compressors switched on and off periodically ; inverter - equipped systems have a variable - frequency drive that control the speed of the motor and thus the compressor and cooling output . The variable - frequency AC from the inverter drives a brushless or induction motor , the speed of which is proportional to the frequency of the AC it is fed , so the compressor can be run at variable speeds -- eliminating compressor stop - start cycles increases efficiency . A microcontroller typically monitors the temperature in the space to be cooled , and adjusts the speed of the compressor to maintain the desired temperature . The additional electronics and system hardware add cost to the equipment , but can result in substantial savings in operating costs .
