Months later , while serving as an officer on the staff of General Ulysses S. Grant , Robert Lincoln recalled the incident to his fellow officer , Colonel Adam Badeau , who happened to be a friend of Edwin Booth . Badeau sent a letter to Booth , complimenting the actor for his heroism . Before receiving the letter , Booth had been unaware that the man whose life he had saved on the train platform had been the president 's son . The incident was said to have been of some comfort to Edwin Booth following his brother 's assassination of the president . President Ulysses Grant also sent Booth a letter of gratitude for his action .
