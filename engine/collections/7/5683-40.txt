A number of studies have looked at the structure of the community and the interaction between askers and responders . Studies of user typology on the site have revealed that some users answer from personal knowledge -- `` specialists '' -- while others use external sources to construct answers -- `` synthesists '' , with synthesists tending to accumulate more reward points . Adamic et al. looked at the ego networks of users and showed that it is possible to distinguish `` answer people '' from `` discussion people '' with the former found in specialist categories for factual information , such as mathematics and the latter more common in general interest categories , such as marriage and wrestling . They also show that answer length is a good predictor of `` best answer '' choice . Kim and Oh looked at the comments given by users on choosing best answers and showed that content completeness , solution feasibility and personal agreement / confirmation were the most significant criteria .
