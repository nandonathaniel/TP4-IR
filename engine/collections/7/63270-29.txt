A renewable energy source such as biomass is sometimes regarded as a good alternative to providing heat and electricity with fossil fuels . Biofuels are not inherently ecologically friendly for this purpose , while burning biomass is carbon - neutral , air pollution is still produced . For example , the Netherlands , once leader in use of palm oil as a biofuel , has suspended all subsidies for palm oil due to the scientific evidence that their use `` may sometimes create more environmental harm than fossil fuels '' . The Netherlands government and environmental groups are trying to trace the origins of imported palm oil , to certify which operations produce the oil in a responsible manner . Regarding biofuels from foodstuffs , the realization that converting the entire grain harvest of the US would only produce 16 % of its auto fuel needs , and the decimation of Brazil 's CO absorbing tropical rain forests to make way for biofuel production has made it clear that placing energy markets in competition with food markets results in higher food prices and insignificant or negative impact on energy issues such as global warming or dependence on foreign energy . Recently , alternatives to such undesirable sustainable fuels are being sought , such as commercially viable sources of cellulosic ethanol .
