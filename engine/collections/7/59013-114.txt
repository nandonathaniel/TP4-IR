There are some uncertainties about the date and the identity of the Satakarni in question , as a king Satakarni is mentioned in the Hathigumpha inscription which is sometimes dated to the 2nd century BCE . Also , several Satavahana kings used the name `` Satakarni '' , which complicates the matter . Usual dates given for the gateways range from 50 BCE to the 1st century CE . Another early Satavahana monument is known , Cave No. 19 of king Kanha ( 100 - 70 BCE ) at the Nasik caves , which is much less developed artistically than the Sanchi toranas .
