The Pardoner 's Tale is one of The Canterbury Tales by Geoffrey Chaucer . In the order of the Tales , it comes after The Physician 's Tale and before The Shipman 's Tale ; it is prompted by the Host 's desire to hear something positive after that depressing tale . The Pardoner initiates his Prologue -- briefly accounting his methods of conning people -- and then proceeds to tell a moral tale .
