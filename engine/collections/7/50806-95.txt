For space launches from Earth , relatively short acceleration distances ( less than a few km ) would require very strong acceleration forces , higher than humans can tolerate . Other designs include a longer helical ( spiral ) track , or a large ring design whereby a space vehicle would circle the ring numerous times , gradually gaining speed , before being released into a launch corridor leading skyward . Nevertheless , if technically feasible and cost effective to build , imparting hyper - velocity escape velocity to a projectile launching at sea level , where the atmosphere is the most dense , may result in much of the launch velocity being lost to aerodynamic drag . In addition , the projectile might still require some form of on - board guidance and control to realize a useful orbital insertion angle that may not be achievable based simply on the launcher 's upward elevation angle relative to the surface of the earth , ( see practical considerations of escape velocity ) .
