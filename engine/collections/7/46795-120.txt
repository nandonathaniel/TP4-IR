The commitment of Patriots to republican values was a key intellectual foundation of the American Revolution . In particular , the key was Patriots ' intense fear of political corruption and the threat it posed to liberty . Bernard Bailyn states , `` The fact that the ministerial conspiracy against liberty had risen from corruption was of the utmost importance to the colonists . '' In 1768 to 1773 newspaper exposés such as John Dickinson 's series of `` Letters from a Farmer in Pennsylvania '' ( 1767 - 68 ) were widely reprinted and spread American disgust with British corruption . Exposés made Britain 's power seem either maddening . The patriot press provided emphasized British corruption , mismanagement , and tyranny . Britain was increasingly portrayed as corrupt and hostile and that of a threat to the very idea of democracy ; a threat to the established liberties that colonists enjoyed and to colonial property rights . The greatest threat to liberty was thought by many to be corruption -- not just in London but at home as well . The colonists associated it with luxury and , especially , inherited aristocracy , which they condemned . Historian J.G.A. Pocock argues that Republicanism explains the American Revolution in terms of virtuous Republican resistance to British imperial corruption .
