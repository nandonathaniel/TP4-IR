In the 17th century rich peasants who had ties to the market economy provided much of the capital investment necessary or agricultural growth , and frequently moved from village to village ( or town ) . Geographic mobility , directly tied to the market and the need for investment capital , was the main path to social mobility . The `` stable '' core of French society , town guildspeople and village laboureurs , included cases of staggering social and geographic continuity , but even this core required regular renewal . Accepting the existence of these two societies , the constant tension between them , and extensive geographic and social mobility tied to a market economy holds the key to a clearer understanding of the evolution of the social structure , economy , and even political system of early modern France . Collins ( 1991 ) argues that the Annales School paradigm underestimated the role of the market economy ; failed to explain the nature of capital investment in the rural economy ; and grossly exaggerated social stability .
