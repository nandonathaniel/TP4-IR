These values vary greatly depending on license type and documented needs , but it 's an established practice to receive around 5 slots for target shooting and hunting and 10 slots for collecting . A target - shooting license requires the applicant to possess a valid shooting competition license ( by taking part in 2 to 4 ISSF - regulated shooting competitions per year for each category of firearm owned : handgun , rifle and shotgun ) , and allows carrying a loaded concealed firearm in public . A collecting license allows obtaining and use of ( in shooting range ) any type of unstationary weapon including selective fire and fully automatic firearms . A self - defense license requires proving a `` constant , substantial and higher than average '' danger . There are separate , lifelong permits for high - ranking ex-military and police officers , generally allowing them to own one handgun . Institutional permits allow for firearm ownership by security companies .
