These cumuliform clouds of free convection have clear - cut medium - grey flat bases and white domed tops in the form of small sproutings and generally do not produce precipitation . They usually form in the low level of the troposphere except during conditions of very low relative humidity when the clouds bases can rise into the middle altitude range . Moderate cumulus is officially classified as low - level and more informally characterized as having vertical extent that can involve more than one altitude level .
