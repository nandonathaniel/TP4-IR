A `` pre-feasibility '' report was published in May 2015 stating that a joint Winter Olympics Games with Australia would be feasible for 2026 . Bruce McGechan , in a news release on 26 June 2015 , said that the New Zealand Olympic Committee had considered the report but had decided not to ask the New Zealand Government to do a full feasibility study of hosting the 2026 Olympic Winter Games . Therefore the Olympic Winter Games NZ 2026 project was shelved .
