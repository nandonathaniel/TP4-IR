When Parton re-recorded the song in 1982 for the soundtrack of the film The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas , the track was issued as a single and once again charted at number one on Hot Country Songs -- making her the first artist ever to earn a number one record twice with the same song . After recording a duet with Vince Gill in 1995 for the album Something Special , `` I Will Always Love You '' re-entered the Billboard chart and peaked at number 15 . Another duet version of the song was released in 2017 with Michael Bolton from his album Songs of Cinema .
