Oscar openly admits that he does not like anything or anybody that is nice , except young human children ( the only people that he can actually act nice to without facing ridicule from his fellow Grouches ) as well as older fans of the show . However , the only person he has ever liked on - camera was Maria , which he would never admit . He once inadvertently complimented a dance that his followers , The Grouchketeers , had performed for him . Oscar has shown rare acts of kindness such as trying to replace Ernie 's rubber duckie when Ernie had lost it . He also went out to find the missing Big Bird in `` Christmas Eve on Sesame Street '' . He and his girlfriend Grundgetta also love each other , though their relationship is ( understandably ) somewhat rocky ( though he does show he cares for her ) . As stated above , he is usually very nice to children especially when making public appearances with Spinney . According to a recent episode , Oscar hates `` Pox News '' ( a parody of Fox News ) but his mother likes it .
