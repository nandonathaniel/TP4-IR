Besides NASCAR , there are a number of other national or regional stock - car sanctioning bodies in the United States . There are a few organizations that cater to these local short tracks . The Automobile Racing Club of America ( ARCA ) , American Speed Association ( ASA ) , Champion Racing Association ( CRA ) , International Motor Contest Association ( IMCA ) , United Auto Racing Association UARA , and United Speed Alliance Racing ( USAR ) all sanction their own forms of stock - car racing , on varying types of track , and with various levels of media coverage . The International Race of Champions ( IROC ) series used stock cars , but is usually perceived as being outside of the usual stock car racing scene because of its ' All - Star ' design .
