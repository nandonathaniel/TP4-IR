In the spring of 1753 , Paul Marin de la Malgue was given command of a 2,000 - man force of Troupes de la Marine and Indians . His orders were to protect the King 's land in the Ohio Valley from the British . Marin followed the route that Céloron had mapped out four years earlier . Céloron , however , had limited the record of French claims to the burial of lead plates , whereas Marin constructed and garrisoned forts . He first constructed Fort Presque Isle on Lake Erie 's south shore near Erie , Pennsylvania , and he had a road built to the headwaters of LeBoeuf Creek . He then constructed a second fort at Fort Le Boeuf in Waterford , Pennsylvania , designed to guard the headwaters of LeBoeuf Creek . As he moved south , he drove off or captured British traders , alarming both the British and the Iroquois . Tanaghrisson was a chief of the Mingo Indians , who were remnants of Iroquois and other tribes who had been driven west by colonial expansion . He intensely disliked the French whom he accused of killing and eating his father . He traveled to Fort Le Boeuf and threatened the French with military action , which Marin contemptuously dismissed .
