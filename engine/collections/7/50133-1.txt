Association of Southeast Asian Nations ( ASEAN ) is an important partner for United States in both economic and geostrategic aspects . ASEAN 's geostrategic importance stems from many factors , including : the strategic location of member countries , the large shares of global trade that pass through regional waters , and the alliances and partnerships which the United States shares with ASEAN member states . In July 2009 , the United States signed ASEAN 's Treaty of Amity and Cooperation , which establishes guiding principles intended to build confidence among its signatories with the aim of maintaining regional peace and stability . Trade flows are robust and increasing between America and the ASEAN region .
