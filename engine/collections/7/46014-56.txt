Yosemite is famous for its high concentration of waterfalls in a small area . Numerous sheer drops , glacial steps and hanging valleys in the park provide many places for waterfalls to exist , especially during April , May , and June ( the snowmelt season ) . Located in Yosemite Valley , the Yosemite Falls is the highest in North America at 2,425 feet ( 739 m ) . Also in Yosemite Valley is the much lower volume Ribbon Falls , which has the highest single vertical drop , 1,612 feet ( 491 m ) . Perhaps the most prominent of the Yosemite Valley waterfalls is Bridalveil Fall , which is the waterfall seen from the Tunnel View viewpoint at the east end of the Wawona Tunnel . Wapama Falls in Hetch Hetchy Valley is another notable waterfall . Hundreds of ephemeral waterfalls also exist in the park .
