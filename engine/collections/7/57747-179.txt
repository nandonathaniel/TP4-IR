Barcelona is served by a comprehensive local public transport network that includes a metro , a bus network , two separate modern tram networks , a separate historic tram line , and several funiculars and aerial cable cars . Most of these networks and lines form a coordinated fare system , administered by the Autoritat del Transport Metropolit√† ( ATM ) , although they are operated by a number of different bodies . This integrated public transport is divided into different zones ( 1 to 6 ) and depending on usage various Integrated Travel Cards are available .
