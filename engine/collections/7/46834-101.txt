In County Galway , 600 -- 700 Volunteers mobilised on Tuesday under Liam Mellows . His plan was to `` bottle up the British garrison and divert the British from concentrating on Dublin '' . However , his men were poorly armed , with only 25 rifles , 60 revolvers , 300 shotguns and some homemade grenades -- many of them only had pikes . Most of the action took place in a rural area to the east of Galway city . They made unsuccessful attacks on the RIC barracks at Clarinbridge and Oranmore , captured several officers , and bombed a bridge and railway line , before taking up position near Athenry . There was also a skirmish between rebels and an RIC mobile patrol at Carnmore crossroads . A constable , Patrick Whelan , was shot dead after he had called to the rebels : `` Surrender , boys , I know ye all '' .
