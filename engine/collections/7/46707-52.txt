The figures in the four panels of the lower register are all positioned within uniform niches . The outer panels show the donors Joost Vijdt and his wife Lysbette Borluut . The inner panels contain grisaille paintings of Saint John the Baptist and Saint John the Evangelist . The grisaille is used to give the illusion of sculpture and imply that these are cult representations of the two saints before which the donors kneel , gazing into the distance with their hands clasped together in veneration . As with the most of the other panels on the inner and outer views , they are lit from the right . Shadows thrown by the figures establish depth , and bring realism to both the faux statues and painted niches .
