Fred Henry ( Will Arnett ) is a meteorologist and Navy veteran . While being interviewed , he claims that he has a three - step plan to double profits at the branch ; however , it becomes clear that he is merely bluffing . However , in an interview with the camera crew , it is shown that he remains confident that he will be hired for the job ( even though he does not even remember the name of the company he interviewed at , erroneously believing it is `` Vance Refrigeration '' after glancing at the building tenants list ) . Paul Lieberstein said at the time that Arnett would have been a top choice to really take the role , but he had filmed a pilot that was likely to get a pickup at NBC after his appearance was filmed ( that pilot being for the television series Up All Night ) .
