South Africa 's main economic role was as the country that supplied two - thirds of gold production in the British Empire , most of the remainder coming from Australia . When the war began , Bank of England officials worked with the government of South Africa to block any gold shipments to Germany , and force the mine owners to sell only to the British Treasury , at prices set by the Treasury . This facilitated purchases of munitions and food in the United States and neutral countries .
