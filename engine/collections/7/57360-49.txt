Germany , the United States , and Britain colonized the Samoan Islands . The nations came into conflict in the Second Samoan Civil War and the nations resolved their issues , establishing American Samoa as per the Treaty of Berlin , 1899 . The U.S. took control of its allotted region on June 7 , 1900 , with the Deed of Cession . Tutuila Island and Aunuu Island were ceded by their chiefs in 1900 , then added to American Samoa . Manua was annexed in 1904 , then added to American Samoa . Swains Island was annexed in 1925 ( occupied since 1856 ) , then added to American Samoa . ( The claim is currently disputed by Tokelau , a colonial territory of New Zealand . ) American Samoa was under the control of the U.S. Navy from 1900 to 1951 . American Samoa was made a formal territory in 1929 . From 1951 until 1977 , Territorial Governors were appointed by the Secretary of the Interior . Immigration of Americans was never as strong as it was , for instance , in Hawaii ; indigenous Samoans make up 89 % of the population . The islands have been reluctant to separate from the U.S. in any manner .
