The starting five from each conference consists of three frontcourt players and two guards , selected by a combination of fan , player , and media voting . In 2017 , the NBA moved from a pure fan vote to a weighted process wherein fan voting accounts for 50 % of the total and player and media voting account for 25 % each . The league made the change in response to social media campaigns that resulted in mediocre players such as journeyman Zaza Pachulia nearly being voted as All - Star starters over more deserving players. , Prior to 2013 , fans selected two forwards and one center instead of generic frontcourt players . The NBA in 2003 began offering All - Star ballots in three languages -- English , Spanish and Chinese -- for fan voting of the starters .
