Water supplies from wells in karst topography may be unsafe , as the water may have run unimpeded from a sinkhole in a cattle pasture , through a cave and to the well , bypassing the normal filtering that occurs in a porous aquifer . Karst formations are cavernous and therefore have high rates of permeability , resulting in reduced opportunity for contaminants to be filtered . Groundwater in karst areas is just as easily polluted as surface streams . Sinkholes have often been used as farmstead or community trash dumps . Overloaded or malfunctioning septic tanks in karst landscapes may dump raw sewage directly into underground channels .
