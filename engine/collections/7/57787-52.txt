Harold appears to have died late in the battle , although accounts in the various sources are contradictory . William of Poitiers only mentions his death , without giving any details on how it occurred . The Tapestry is not helpful , as it shows a figure holding an arrow sticking out of his eye next to a falling fighter being hit with a sword . Over both figures is a statement `` Here King Harold has been killed '' . It is not clear which figure is meant to be Harold , or if both are meant . The earliest written mention of the traditional account of Harold dying from an arrow to the eye dates to the 1080s from a history of the Normans written by an Italian monk , Amatus of Montecassino . William of Malmesbury stated that Harold died from an arrow to the eye that went into the brain , and that a knight wounded Harold at the same time . Wace repeats the arrow - to - the - eye account . The Carmen states that Duke William killed Harold , but this is unlikely , as such a feat would have been recorded elsewhere . The account of William of Jumi√®ges is even more unlikely , as it has Harold dying in the morning , during the first fighting . The Chronicle of Battle Abbey states that no one knew who killed Harold , as it happened in the press of battle . A modern biographer of Harold , Ian Walker , states that Harold probably died from an arrow in the eye , although he also says it is possible that Harold was struck down by a Norman knight while mortally wounded in the eye . Another biographer of Harold , Peter Rex , after discussing the various accounts , concludes that it is not possible to declare how Harold died .
