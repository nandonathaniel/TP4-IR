Both sides tried to break the stalemate using scientific and technological advances . On 22 April 1915 , at the Second Battle of Ypres , the Germans ( violating the Hague Convention ) used chlorine gas for the first time on the Western Front . Several types of gas soon became widely used by both sides , and though it never proved a decisive , battle - winning weapon , poison gas became one of the most - feared and best - remembered horrors of the war . Tanks were developed by Britain and France and were first used in combat by the British during the Battle of Flers -- Courcelette ( part of the Battle of the Somme ) on 15 September 1916 , with only partial success . However , their effectiveness would grow as the war progressed ; the Allies built tanks in large numbers , whilst the Germans employed only a few of their own design , supplemented by captured Allied tanks .
