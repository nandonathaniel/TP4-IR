One suggested that a goal of interview preparation should be to present oneself as `` comfortable with spontaneous conversation '' and be able to talk about interests without sounding like the answers were prepared in advance , and suggested it was important to show intellectual passion and a love of learning with a deep excitement , and show `` social maturity '' with sensitivity , empathy for others unlike oneself , and concern for issues larger than personal career ambitions . An applicant should have an attitude that was not be what can the college offer but what can the student offer the college , and he or she should avoid asking questions about facts better answered elsewhere , and show an openness to new ideas , an ability to work cooperatively with others , ambition , and caring about others . Interviewees should be ready for sometimes provocative questions to test social sensitivity ; if an interviewer asks a `` baiting or leading question '' , an applicant should respond by laughing while politely disagreeing with the perspective , and to keep trying to enjoy the conversation with the interviewer . Another advisor suggested that students must be prepared to answer the question What is your biggest failure in an interview . Applicants should avoid sounding snide , annoyed , contemptuous , and avoid describing oneself as humiliated , bored , depressed , angry , shy , inhibited , anxious , frightened , and frustrated , and should be upbeat but avoid going for the hard sell . Another report suggested that shy or timid applicants were at a disadvantage . Another advisor suggested that a student try to find a common bond with the interviewer , and send a brief follow - up letter afterwards .
