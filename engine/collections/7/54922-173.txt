In October 2013 , Al Jazeera reported that the gulf ecosystem was `` in crisis '' , citing a decline in seafood catches , as well as deformities and lesions found in fish . In Louisiana , 4.6 million pounds of oily material was removed from the beaches in 2013 , over double the amount collected in 2012 . Oil cleanup crews worked four days a week on 55 miles of Louisiana shoreline throughout 2013 . Oil continued to be found as far from the Macondo site as the Florida panhandle , where scientists said the oil and dispersant mixture is embedded in the sand . Researchers looking at sediment , seawater , biota , and seafood found toxic compounds in high concentrations that they said was due to the added oil and dispersants . Although Gulf fisheries recovered in 2011 , a 2014 study of the effects of the oil spill on bluefin tuna by researchers at Stanford University and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration , published in the journal Science , found that toxins released by the oil spill sent fish into cardiac arrest . The study found that even very low concentrations of crude oil can slow the pace of fish heartbeats . BP disputed the study , which was conducted as part of the federal Natural Resource Damage Assessment process required by the Oil Pollution Act . The study also found that oil already broken down by wave action and chemical dispersants was more toxic than fresh oil . Another peer - reviewed study , released in March 2014 and conducted by 17 scientists from the United States and Australia and published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , found that tuna and amberjack that were exposed to oil from the spill developed deformities of the heart and other organs . BP responded that the concentrations of oil in the study were a level rarely seen in the Gulf , but The New York Times reported that the BP statement was contradicted by the study .
