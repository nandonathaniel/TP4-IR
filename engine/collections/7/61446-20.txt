Will arrives and is revealed to have lost an enormous amount of weight . However , he reacts very badly when learning that Rachel Green , who he hated in high school , will be joining them for dinner . Rachel is immediately attracted to Will , unable to recognise him , but Will is openly hostile and this culminates in his proud announcement that he - and Ross - founded the `` I Hate Rachel '' club in high school and initiated a rumour that she was a hermaphrodite , which was spread throughout their entire high school . Rachel feels betrayed by Ross , until Monica reminds her that she started a rumor of her own that Ross made out with the school 's 50 - year - old librarian , though a horrified Ross confirms it as true . Rachel demands that Ross recant the rumour by calling everyone from school , but Monica puts them both in their place by reminding them that Rachel 's rumour put Ross on the social radar , that Ross and Will 's rumour had no effect whatsoever on Rachel 's queen bee status , and that they 're having a baby together . Will is completely dumbfounded by this revelation , but takes pleasure in the fact that Ross got Rachel pregnant but is n't going to marry her .
