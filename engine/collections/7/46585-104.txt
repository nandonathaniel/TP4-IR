The war ended in 1954 with French withdrawal and a partition of Vietnam that was intended to be temporary until elections could be held . The Democratic Republic of Vietnam held the north while South Vietnam formed into a separate republic in control of Ngo Dinh Diem who was backed in his refusal to hold elections by the US . The communist party of the south eventually organized the common front NLF to fight to unite south and north under the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and thus began the Vietnam War , which ended with the Democratic Republic of Vietnam conquering the South in 1975 .
