In some cultures , particularly in the Anglophone West , wives often change their surnames to that of the husband upon getting married . For some , this is a controversial practice , due to its tie to the historical doctrine of coverture and to the historically subordinated roles of wives . Others argue that today this is merely a harmless tradition that should be accepted as a free choice . Some jurisdictions consider this practice as discriminatory and contrary to women 's rights , and have restricted or banned it ; for example , since 1983 , when Greece adopted a new marriage law which guaranteed gender equality between the spouses , women in Greece are required to keep their birth names for their whole life .
