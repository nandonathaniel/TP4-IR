This Clause of the Constitution was also mentioned by the Supreme Court in the infamous Scott v. Sandford case in 1857 : Chief Justice Taney , speaking for the majority , said that this Clause gives state citizens , when in other states , the right to travel , the right to sojourn , the right to free speech , the right to assemble , and the right to keep and bear arms ; even as the Court excluded all African - Americans from citizenship , it indicated that citizens ' free speech was limited : `` full liberty of speech in public and in private upon all subjects upon which its ( a slave State 's ) own citizens might speak . '' Justice McLean in his dissent speaks of the right to sue without expounding this Clause at length . Justice Curtis asserts in his dissent that this Clause does not confer any rights other than rights that a visited state chooses to guarantee to its own citizens .
