The UK has some opt - outs from EU policies . One is the opt - out from the Schengen Area , meaning there are full passport checks for travellers from other EU countries except the Republic of Ireland , which is part of the Common Travel Area ( CTA ) with the UK . The Scottish government proposed that an independent Scotland should remain outside the Schengen Area and join the CTA , ensuring that no passport controls would be needed at the Anglo - Scottish border . Nicola Sturgeon commented that an independent Scotland would negotiate with the EU to have the same visa arrangements as the UK has .
