Carbon taxes offer a potentially cost - effective means of reducing greenhouse gas emissions . From an economic perspective , carbon taxes are a type of Pigovian tax . They help to address the problem of emitters of greenhouse gases not facing the full social cost of their actions . Carbon taxes can be a regressive tax , in that they may directly or indirectly affect low - income groups disproportionately . The regressive impact of carbon taxes could be addressed by using tax revenues to favour low - income groups .
