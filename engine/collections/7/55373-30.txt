`` Heaven Must Have Sent You '' was one of two remakes of Motown hits recorded by Bonnie Pointer for her 1978 self - titled solo debut album which was released by Motown : Pointer would state : `` '' I wanted to cut that tune and the other old Motown tune : ' When I 'm Gone ' , simply because I 've always dug them . '' Pointer has stated that she suggested to Berry Gordy that he have her remake `` Heaven Must Have Sent You '' as a disco track after Pointer had heard the Village People hit `` Y.M.C.A. '' and realized that `` Heaven Must Have Sent You '' would work well with an arrangement similar to that of `` Y.M.C.A '' .
