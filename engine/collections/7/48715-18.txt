Pseudo-melanism ( abundism ) occurs in leopards . A pseudo-melanistic leopard has a normal background color , but the spots are more densely packed than normal and merge to obscure the golden - brown background color . Any spots on the flanks and limbs that have not merged into the mass of swirls and stripes are unusually small and discrete , rather than forming rosettes . The face and underparts are paler and dappled like those of ordinary spotted leopards .
