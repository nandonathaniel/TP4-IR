The Shia , Ahmadiyya , and Sunni agree on the essential details for the performance and practice of these acts , but the Shia do not refer to them by the same name ( see Ancillaries of the Faith , for the Twelvers , and Seven pillars of Ismailism ) . They make up Muslim life , prayer , concern for the needy , self - purification , and the pilgrimage , if one is able .
