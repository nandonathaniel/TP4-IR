Hoofed animals walk on the tips of special toes , the hoofs . Cloven - hoofed animals walk on a central pair of hoofs , but many also have an outer pair of dewclaws on each foot . These are somewhat farther up the leg than the main hoofs , and similar in structure to them . In some species ( such as cattle ) the dewclaws are much smaller than the hoofs and never touch the ground . In others ( such as pigs and many deer ) , they are only a little smaller than the hoofs , and may reach the ground in soft conditions or when jumping . Some hoofed animals ( such as giraffes and modern horses ) have no dewclaws . Video evidence suggests some animals use dewclaws in grooming or scratching themselves or to have better grasp during mating .
