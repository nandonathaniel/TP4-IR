Gavaskar was also a fine slip fielder and his safe catching in the slips helped him become the first Indian ( excluding wicket - keepers ) to take over a hundred catches in Test matches . In one ODI against Pakistan in Sharjah in 1985 , he took four catches and helped India defend a small total of 125 . Early in his Test career , when India rarely used pace bowlers , Gavaskar also opened the bowling for a short spell on occasions if only one pace bowler was playing , before a three - pronged spin attack took over . The only wicket claimed by him is that of Pakistani Zaheer Abbas in 1978 -- 79 .
