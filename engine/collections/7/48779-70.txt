Goal Directed : Each child must have an individualised Education Program ( IEP ) that distinguishes his / her particular needs . The child must get the services that are designed for him / her . These services will allow him / her to reach his / her annual goals which will be assessed at the end of each term along with short - term goals that will be assessed every few months . Research - Based Methods - There has been a lot of research done about students with disabilities and the best way to teach them . Testing , IQs , interviews , the discrepancy model , etc. should all be used to determine where to place the child . Once that is determined , the next step is the best way for the child to learn . There are plenty of different programs such as the Wilson Reading Program and Direct Instruction Guided by student performance - While the IEP goals may be assessed every few months to a year , constant informal assessments must take place . These assessments will guide instruction for the teacher . The teacher will be able to determine if the material is too difficult or to easy .
