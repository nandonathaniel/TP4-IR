Their next album , A Kind of Hush , was released on June 11 , 1976 , and was certified gold . However , it was the first Carpenters ' album not to become platinum - certified since Ticket to Ride seven years earlier . The duo had several hits that year , but by this time the public had become over-familiar with them , and sales fell . Their biggest single that year was a cover of Herman 's Hermits ' `` There 's a Kind of Hush ( All Over the World ) '' , which peaked at No. 12 on the Billboard Hot 100 . `` I Need to Be in Love '' ( Karen 's favorite song by the Carpenters ) charted at No. 25 on the Billboard Hot 100 . However , it followed `` There 's a Kind of Hush '' to the top spot on the Adult Contemporary charts and became the duo 's 14th No. 1 Adult Contemporary hit , more than any other act in the history of the chart .
