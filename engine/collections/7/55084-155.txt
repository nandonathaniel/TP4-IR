Additionally , some states , mostly those with an international border , issue enhanced driver licenses and enhanced ID cards . Enhanced licenses combine a regular driver 's license with the specifications of the new federal passport card . Thus , in addition to providing driving privileges , the enhanced license also is proof of U.S. citizenship , and can therefore be used to cross the Canadian and Mexican borders by road , rail , or sea , although air travel still requires a traditional passport book . The enhanced licenses are also fully Real ID compliant .
