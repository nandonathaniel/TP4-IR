The idea of co-operation among major Muslim developing countries was mooted by Prof. Dr. Necmettin Erbakan , the then Prime Minister of Turkey , during a Seminar on `` Cooperation in Development '' which was held in Istanbul in October 1996 . The group envisioned co-operation among countries stretching from South East Asia to Africa . Representatives from Bangladesh , Egypt , Indonesia , Iran , Malaysia , Nigeria and Pakistan attended the Seminar . This conference was the first step towards the establishment of D - 8 and it was only after a series of preparatory meetings that D - 8 was set up officially and began its activities with the Istanbul Declaration issued at the end of the summit of Heads of State and Government held in Istanbul on 15 June 1997
