John Adams persuaded the committee to select Thomas Jefferson to compose the original draft of the document , which Congress would edit to produce the final version . The Declaration was ultimately a formal explanation of why Congress had voted on July 2 to declare independence from Great Britain , more than a year after the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War . The next day , Adams wrote to his wife Abigail : `` The Second Day of July 1776 , will be the most memorable Epocha , in the History of America . '' But Independence Day is actually celebrated on July 4 , the date that the Declaration of Independence was approved .
