French artists developed the rococo style in the 18th century , as a more intimate imitation of old baroque style , the works of the court - endorsed artists Antoine Watteau , François Boucher and Jean - Honoré Fragonard being the most representative in the country . The French Revolution brought great changes , as Napoleon favoured artists of neoclassic style such as Jacques - Louis David and the highly influential Académie des Beaux - Arts defined the style known as Academism . At this time France had become a centre of artistic creation , the first half of the 19th century being dominated by two successive movements , at first Romanticism with Théodore Géricault and Eugène Delacroix , and Realism with Camille Corot , Gustave Courbet and Jean - François Millet , a style that eventually evolved into Naturalism .
