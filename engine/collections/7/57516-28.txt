STAC suggested that two designs naturally fell out of their work , a transatlantic model flying at about Mach 2 , and a shorter - range version flying at perhaps Mach 1.2 . Morgan suggested that a 150 - passenger transatlantic SST would cost about £ 75 to £ 90 million to develop , and be in service in 1970 . The smaller 100 passenger short - range version would cost perhaps £ 50 to £ 80 million , and be ready for service in 1968 . To meet this schedule , development would need to begin in 1960 , with production contracts let in 1962 . Morgan strongly suggested that the US was already involved in a similar project , and that if the UK failed to respond it would be locked out of an airliner market that he believed would be dominated by SST aircraft .
