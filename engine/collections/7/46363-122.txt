The U.S. robotic Surveyor program was part of an effort to locate a safe site on the Moon for a human landing and test under lunar conditions the radar and landing systems required to make a true controlled touchdown . Five of Surveyor 's seven missions made successful unmanned Moon landings . Surveyor 3 was visited two years after its Moon landing by the crew of Apollo 12 . They removed parts of it for examination back on Earth to determine the effects of long - term exposure to the lunar environment .
