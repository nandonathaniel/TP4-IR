Clock faces that use Roman numerals normally show IIII for four o'clock but IX for nine o'clock , a practice that goes back to very early clocks such as the Wells Cathedral clock of the late 14th century . However , this is far from universal : for example , the clock on the Palace of Westminster in London ( aka `` Big Ben '' ) uses a `` normal '' IV .
