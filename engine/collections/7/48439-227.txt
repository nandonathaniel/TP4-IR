Primary health care is provided by city and district hospitals and rural primary health centres ( PHCs ) . These hospitals provide treatment free of cost , but only if they are functional . Primary care is focused on immunization , prevention of malnutrition , pregnancy , child birth , postnatal care , and treatment of common illnesses . Patients who receive specialized care or have complicated illnesses are referred to secondary ( often located in district and taluk headquarters ) and tertiary care hospitals ( located in district and state headquarters or those that are teaching hospitals ) .
