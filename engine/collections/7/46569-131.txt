In 1992 , a non-governmental organization , Greenpeace , was spurred by corporate executive policies and requested that a European lab find substitute refrigerants . This led to two alternatives , one a blend of propane ( R290 ) and isobutane ( R600a ) , and one of pure isobutane . Industry resisted change in Europe until 1993 , and in the U.S. until 2011 , despite some supportive steps in 2004 and 2008 ( see Refrigerant Development above ) .
