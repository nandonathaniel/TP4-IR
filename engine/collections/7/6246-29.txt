The aging Yamamoto Tsunetomo 's interpretation of bushidō is perhaps more illustrative of the philosophy refined by his unique station and experience , at once dutiful and defiant , ultimately incompatible with the laws of an emerging civil society . Of the 47 rōnin -- to this day , generally regarded as exemplars of bushidō -- Tsunetomo felt they were remiss in hatching such a wily , delayed plot for revenge , and had been over-concerned with the success of their undertaking . Instead , Tsunetomo felt true samurai should act without hesitation to fulfill their duties , without regard for success or failure .
