After a request for assistance from Lithuania , the League Council called for Poland 's withdrawal from the area . The Polish government indicated they would comply , but instead reinforced the city with more Polish troops . This prompted the League to decide that the future of Vilnius should be determined by its residents in a plebiscite and that the Polish forces should withdraw and be replaced by an international force organised by the League . The plan was met with resistance in Poland , Lithuania , and the Soviet Union , which opposed any international force in Lithuania . In March 1921 , the League abandoned plans for the plebiscite . After unsuccessful proposals by Paul Hymans to create a federation between Poland and Lithuania , Vilnius and the surrounding area was formally annexed by Poland in March 1922 . After Lithuania took over the KlaipÄ—da Region , the Allied Conference set the frontier between Lithuania and Poland , leaving Vilnius within Poland , on 14 March 1923 . Lithuanian authorities refused to accept the decision , and officially remained in a state of war with Poland until 1927 . It was not until the 1938 Polish ultimatum that Lithuania restored diplomatic relations with Poland and thus de facto accepted the borders .
