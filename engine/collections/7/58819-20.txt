The British Invasion had a profound impact on popular music , internationalizing the production of rock and roll , establishing the British popular music industry as a viable centre of musical creativity , and opening the door for subsequent British performers to achieve international success . In America , the Invasion arguably spelled the end of the popularity of instrumental surf music , pre-Motown vocal girl groups , the folk revival ( which adapted by evolving into folk rock ) , and temporarily , the teen idols that had dominated the American charts in the late 1950s and 1960s .
