Civilizations tended to grow up in river valleys for a number of reasons . The most obvious is access to a usually reliable source of water for agriculture and human needs . Plentiful water , and the enrichment of the soil due to annual floods , made it possible to grow excess crops beyond what was needed to sustain an agricultural village . This allowed for some members of the community to engage in non-agricultural activities such as construction of buildings and cities ( the root of the word `` civilization '' ) , metal working , trade , and social organization . Boats on the river provided an easy and efficient way to transport people and goods , allowing for the development of trade and facilitating central control of outlying areas .
