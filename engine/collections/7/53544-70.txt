Despite Spielberg 's rejection , the studio went ahead with plans to make the sequel , leading to an arduous 18 - month pre-production process . Howard Sackler , who had contributed to the first film 's script but chose not to be credited , was charged with writing the first draft . He originally proposed a prequel based on the sinking of the USS Indianapolis , the story relayed by Quint in the first film . Although Universal president Sidney Sheinberg thought Sackler 's treatment for the film was intriguing , he rejected the idea . On Sackler 's recommendation , theatre and film director John D. Hancock was chosen to helm the picture . Sackler later felt betrayed when Dorothy Tristan , Hancock 's wife , was invited to rewrite his script .
