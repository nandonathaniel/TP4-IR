Like high school , the four undergraduate grades are commonly called freshman , sophomore , junior , and senior years ( alternatively called first year , second year , etc . ) . Students traditionally apply for admission into colleges . Schools differ in their competitiveness and reputation . Admissions criteria involve the rigor and grades earned in high school courses taken , the students ' GPA , class ranking , and standardized test scores ( Such as the SAT or the ACT tests ) . Most colleges also consider more subjective factors such as a commitment to extracurricular activities , a personal essay , and an interview . While colleges will rarely list that they require a certain standardized test score , class ranking , or GPA for admission , each college usually has a rough threshold below which admission is unlikely .
