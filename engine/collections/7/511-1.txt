The address fulfills rules in Article II , Section 3 of the U.S. Constitution , requiring the President to periodically `` give to the Congress Information of the State of the Union , and recommend to their Consideration such measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient . '' During most of the country 's first century , the President primarily only submitted a written report to Congress . After 1913 , Woodrow Wilson , the 28th U.S. President , began the regular practice of delivering the address to Congress in person as a way to rally support for his agenda . With the advent of radio and television , the address is now broadcast live across the country on many networks .
