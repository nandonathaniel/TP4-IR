All forms of chlorine are widely used , despite their respective drawbacks . One drawback is that chlorine from any source reacts with natural organic compounds in the water to form potentially harmful chemical by - products . These by - products , trihalomethanes ( THMs ) and haloacetic acids ( HAAs ) , are both carcinogenic in large quantities and are regulated by the United States Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) and the Drinking Water Inspectorate in the UK . The formation of THMs and haloacetic acids may be minimized by effective removal of as many organics from the water as possible prior to chlorine addition . Although chlorine is effective in killing bacteria , it has limited effectiveness against protozoa that form cysts in water ( Giardia lamblia and Cryptosporidium , both of which are pathogenic ) .
