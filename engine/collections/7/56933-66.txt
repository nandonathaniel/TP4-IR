Over the last weekend I saw a movie -- I do n't see too many movies but I try to see them on weekends when I am at the Western White House or in Florida -- and the movie that I selected , or , as a matter of fact , my daughter Tricia selected it , was `` Chisum '' with John Wayne . It was a western . And as I looked at that movie , I said , `` Well , it was a very good western , John Wayne is a very fine actor and it was : a fine supporting cast . But it was just basically another western , far better than average movies , better than average westerns . ''
