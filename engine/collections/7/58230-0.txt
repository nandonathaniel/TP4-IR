Cork cambium ( pl . cambia or cambiums ) is a tissue found in many vascular plants as part of the epidermis . The cork cambium is a lateral meristem and is responsible for secondary growth that replaces the epidermis in roots and stems . It is found in woody and many herbaceous dicots , gymnosperms and some monocots ( monocots usually lack secondary growth ) . It is one of the plant 's meristems -- the series of tissues consisting of embryonic disk ( incompletely differentiated ) cells from which the plant grows . It is one of the many layers of bark , between the cork and primary phloem . The function of cork cambium is to produce the cork , a tough protective material .
