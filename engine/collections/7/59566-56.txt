There are five intermediate waters : four low - salinity waters formed at subpolar latitudes and one high - salinity formed through evaporation . Arctic Intermediate Water , flows from north to become the source for North Atlantic Deep Water south of the Greenland - Scotland sill . These two intermediate waters have different salinity in the western and eastern basins . The wide range of salinities in the North Atlantic is caused by the asymmetry of the northern subtropical gyre and the large number of contributions from a wide range of sources : Labrador Sea , Norwegian - Greenland Sea , Mediterranean , and South Atlantic Intermediate Water .
