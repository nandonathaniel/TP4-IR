The problem of having a national spotlight game which during the season 's most critical weeks late in the year probably would not show the most important game of the week was long known by the league and network . As a result of this , the NFL wished to move the `` Game of the Week '' idea to Sunday nights as to make flex scheduling possible . This was a move which would ultimately mean the end of Monday Night Football on ABC ( cable games are protected from the NFL 's flexible scheduling rule adopted for the 2006 -- 07 season ; the new rule applies only to CBS , Fox , and NBC 's Sunday night games ) . The league currently has no interest in expanding flexible scheduling to include Monday Night Football , citing the logistical issues of moving games back and forth between Sundays and Mondays .
