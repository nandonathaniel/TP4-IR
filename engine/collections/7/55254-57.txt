Acting on his obsession with Tim Drake , Todd breaks into Titans Tower to confront the third Robin , thus revealing the truth of their first encounter at the cemetery to his successor . Wearing an altered version of his own Robin costume , Todd quickly immobilizes the other Teen Titans and strikes Drake down in the Tower 's Hall of Fallen Titans . Furious that no memorial statue was made for him ( despite his short tenure as a Titan ) , he demands that Drake tell him if he is really as good as Todd has been told . Drake says `` Yes '' and passes out . As he leaves , he tears the ' R ' emblem from Drake 's chest , though he later admits that Drake has talent . Todd is also left wondering if perhaps he would have been a better Robin and better person had he have had a life like Drake 's and friends like the Titans .
