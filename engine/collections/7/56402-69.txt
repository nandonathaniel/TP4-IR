Breck orders MacDonald to turn Caesar over the minute he returns from an errand , but instead MacDonald , who learns Caesar can indeed speak , gives him the chance to escape . Caesar is captured by police , taken to Ape Management , and brought to an interrogation room resembling a torture chamber . Strapped to an electroshock table , Caesar is jolted with higher and higher amounts of electricity , while Breck commands him again and again , `` Talk ! '' In agony , Caesar gasps `` Have pity ! '' and slumps back on the table , exhausted . MacDonald leaves , showing no stomach for what Breck is doing .
