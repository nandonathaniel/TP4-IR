Ori military tactics varied during the initial incursions into the Milky Way galaxy and the full - scale invasion that was later achieved through the Supergate . The initial incursions were achieved through lone Priors who were sent to worlds in the Milky Way galaxy , preaching to the populace and distributing copies of the Book of Origin . When the people failed to comply , more drastic measures were taken , eventually to the point of destroying the population . The show features powerful Ori weapons in `` Ethon '' , ships in `` Camelot '' , control chairs like that in `` Counterstrike '' and Supergates in `` Beachhead '' . The Ori can be killed by Merlin 's Sangraal weapon , which nullifies ascended beings . As seen in The Ark of Truth , there is also an Ark that Cooper considered `` a truly fascinating centerpiece '' and `` mass brain - washing device '' which causes people to see the truth in any given situation . Comparing the Ark to television as it is `` a box that light comes out of , and you believe what it says '' , Cooper left it open whether the choice to do it without guns was ultimately the better method .
