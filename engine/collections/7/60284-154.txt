Increasing tension between the Liberal and Conservative coalition partners led the Liberal Party executive to vote to instruct Johnson to terminate the arrangement . Johnson ended the coalition and dropped his Conservative cabinet ministers , including Deputy Premier and Finance minister Herbert Anscomb , precipitating the general election of 1952 . A referendum on electoral reform prior to this election had instigated an elimination ballot ( similar to a preferential ballot ) , where voters could select second and third choices . The intent of the ballot , as campaigned for by Liberals and Conservatives , was that their supporters would list the rival party in lieu of the CCF , but this plan backfired when a large group of voters from all major parties , including the CCF , voted for the fringe British Columbia Social Credit Party ( Socreds ) , who wound up with the largest number of seats in the House ( 19 ) , only one seat ahead of the CCF , despite the CCF having 34.3 % of the vote to Social Credit 's 30.18 % .
