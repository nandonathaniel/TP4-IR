Because the source of the Indus River is glacial meltwater from the Himalayas , the river carries huge amounts of sediment , with an annual suspended sediment load of 200 million tons . Live storage capacity of Tarbela reservoir had declined more than 33.5 per cent to 6.434 million acre feet ( MAF ) against its original capacity of 9.679 MAF because of sedimentation over the past 38 years . The useful life of the dam and reservoir was estimated to be approximately 50 years . However , sedimentation has been much lower than predicted , and it is now estimated that the useful lifespan of the dam will be 85 years , to about 2060 .
