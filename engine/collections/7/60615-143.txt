2004 -- 2007 : This period saw a sequence which showed flashed up credits along the bottom third of the screen , whilst a photo of a recent Blue Peter badge winner , with or without the project that won them their badge , was shown above . One of the presenters ' voices was also heard introducing the winner and explaining what they did to win their badge . Occasionally on certain programmes , for example the launch of an appeal , special guests in the studio or when out on location , the credits ran as pre-2004 over the closing moments of the programme with the music fading in . Again , the credits end with the Blue Peter ship , editor and BBC credit .
