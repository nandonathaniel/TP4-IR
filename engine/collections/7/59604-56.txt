Anglicans , particularly high - church Anglo - Catholics , often follow Catholicism and Orthodoxy in believing both man and God are involved in justification . `` Justification has an objective and a subjective aspect . The objective is the act of God in Christ restoring the covenant and opening it to all people . The subjective aspect is faith , trust in the divine factor , acceptance of divine mercy . Apart from the presence of the subjective aspect there is no justification . People are not justified apart from their knowledge or against their will ... God forgives and accepts sinners as they are into the divine fellowship , and that these sinners are in fact changed by their trust in the divine mercy . '' Justification , the establishment of a relationship with God through Christ , and sanctification go hand in hand . In historic Anglicanism , the eleventh article of the Thirty - Nine Articles made it clear that justification can not be earned , `` We are accounted righteous before God ... not for our own works or deservings '' .
