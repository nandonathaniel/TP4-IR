The site of Knossos was discovered in 1878 by Minos Kalokairinos . The excavations in Knossos began in 1900 by the English archaeologist Sir Arthur Evans ( 1851 -- 1941 ) and his team , and continued for 35 years . Its size far exceeded his original expectations , as did the discovery of two ancient scripts , which he termed Linear A and Linear B , to distinguish their writing from the pictographs also present . From the layering of the palace Evans developed an archaeological concept of the civilization that used it , which he called Minoan , following the pre-existing custom of labelling all objects from the location Minoan .
