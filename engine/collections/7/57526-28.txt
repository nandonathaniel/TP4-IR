Rimsky - Korsakov added that `` during the following years , when visiting St. Petersburg , ( Tchaikovsky ) usually came to Balakirev 's , and we saw him . '' Nevertheless , as much as Tchaikovsky may have desired acceptance from both The Five and the traditionalists , he needed the independence that Moscow afforded to find his own direction , away from both parties . This was especially true in light of Rimsky - Korsakov 's comment about the `` considerable barrier '' of Tchaikovsky 's Conservatory training , as well as Anton Rubinstein 's opinion that Tchaikovsky had strayed too far from the examples of the great Western masters . Tchaikovsky was ready for the nourishment of new attitudes and styles so he could continue growing as a composer , and his brother Modest writes that he was impressed by the `` force and vitality '' in some of the Five 's work . However , he was too balanced an individual to totally reject the best in the music and values that Zaremba and Rubinstein had cherished . In his brother Modest 's opinion , Tchaikovsky 's relations with the Saint Petersburg group resembled `` those between two friendly neighboring states ... cautiously prepared to meet on common ground , but jealously guarding their separate interests '' .
