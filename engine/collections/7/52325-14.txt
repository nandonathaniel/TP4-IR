Influential in Europe was the 1920 Paris Convention , which advised driving on the right - hand side of the road , in order to harmonise traffic across a continent with many borders . This was despite the fact that left - hand traffic was still widespread : in 1915 for example , LHT was introduced everywhere in the Austro - Hungarian Empire ; however , three years later the Empire was split up into several countries , and they all changed eventually to RHT , notably including when Nazi Germany introduced RHT with almost immediate effect in Czechoslovakia in 1938 -- 39 .
