In 1972 , the Presbyterian Church of England ( PCofE ) united with the Congregational Church in England and Wales to form the United Reformed Church ( URC ) . Among the congregations the PCofE brought to the URC were Tunley ( Lancashire ) , Aston Tirrold ( Oxfordshire ) and John Knox Presbyterian Church , Stepney , London ( now part of Stepney Meeting House URC ) -- these are among the sole survivors today of the English Presbyterian churches of the 17th century . The URC also has a presence in Scotland , mostly of former Congregationalist Churches . Two former Presbyterian congregations , St Columba 's , Cambridge ( founded in 1879 ) , and St Columba 's , Oxford ( founded as a chaplaincy by the PCofE and the Church of Scotland in 1908 and as a congregation of the PCofE in 1929 ) , continue as congregations of the URC and university chaplaincies of the Church of Scotland .
