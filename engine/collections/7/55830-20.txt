Carbon ( C ) is the fourth most abundant element in the universe by mass after hydrogen , helium and oxygen and is the second most abundant element in the human body by mass after oxygen , the third most abundant by number of atoms . There are an almost infinite number of compounds that contain carbon due to carbon 's ability to form long stable chains of C -- C bonds . All organic compounds , those essential for life , contain at least one atom of carbon ; combined with hydrogen , oxygen , nitrogen , sulfur , and phosphorus , carbon is the basis of every important biological compound .
