During World War II , as in the First World War , the Crown Jewels were stored in the basement of Windsor Castle . The most valuable gems were sealed in a tin or pot , which may have been submerged in a pond or lake at the castle , so they could be taken elsewhere if there was an emergency . After the war , 34 boxes containing the Jewels were kept in a vault at the Bank of England while the Jewel House was repaired ; it had been struck by a bomb . In 1947 , the Jewels went back on display at the Tower of London . In 1953 , nine centuries after the coronation of its namesake , St Edward 's Crown was placed on the head of Queen Elizabeth II in what is now the only ceremony of its kind in Europe . Today , the Crown Jewels are permanently set with 23,578 precious and semi-precious stones , and they are seen in the Jewel House by around 2.5 million visitors from across the world every year .
