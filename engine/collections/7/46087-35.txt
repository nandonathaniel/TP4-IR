Roberta Flack first heard the song on an airline , when the Lieberman original was featured on the in - flight audio program . After scanning the listing of available audio selections , Flack would recall : `` The title , of course , smacked me in the face . I immediately pulled out some scratch paper , made musical staves ( then ) play ( ed ) the song at least eight to ten times jotting down the melody that I heard . When I landed , I immediately called Quincy ( Jones ) at his house and asked him how to meet Charles Fox . Two days later I had the music . '' Shortly afterwards Flack rehearsed the song with her band in the Tuff Gong Studios in Kingston , Jamaica , but did not then record it .
