Bret Easton Ellis stated that Robert Pattinson had been James ' first choice for the role of Christian Grey , but James felt that casting Pattinson and his Twilight co-star Kristen Stewart in the film would be `` weird '' . Ian Somerhalder and Chace Crawford both expressed interest in the role of Christian . Somerhalder later admitted if he had been considered , the filming process would ultimately have conflicted with his shooting schedule for The CW 's series The Vampire Diaries . On September 2 , 2013 , James revealed that Charlie Hunnam and Dakota Johnson had been cast as Christian Grey and Anastasia Steele , respectively . The short list of other actresses considered for the role of Anastasia included Alicia Vikander , Imogen Poots , Elizabeth Olsen , Shailene Woodley , and Felicity Jones . Keeley Hazell auditioned for an unspecified role . Lucy Hale also auditioned for the film . Emilia Clarke was also offered the role of Anastasia but turned down the part because of the nudity required . Taylor - Johnson would give every actress who auditioned for the role of Anastasia four pages to read of a monologue from Ingmar Bergman 's Persona .
