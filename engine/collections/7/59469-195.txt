For Marxists , socialism or , as Marx termed it , the first phase of communist society , can be viewed as a transitional stage characterized by common or state ownership of the means of production under democratic workers ' control and management , which Engels argued was beginning to be realised in the Paris Commune of 1871 , before it was overthrown . Socialism to them is simply the transitional phase between capitalism and `` higher phase of communist society '' . Because this society has characteristics of both its capitalist ancestor and is beginning to show the properties of communism , it will hold the means of production collectively but distributes commodities according to individual contribution . When the socialist state ( the dictatorship of the proletariat ) naturally withers away , what will remain is a society in which human beings no longer suffer from alienation and `` all the springs of co-operative wealth flow more abundantly . '' Here `` society inscribe ( s ) on its banners : From each according to his ability , to each according to his needs ! '' For Marx , a communist society entails the absence of differing social classes and thus the end of class warfare . According to Marx and Engels , once a socialist society had been ushered in , the state would begin to `` wither away '' , and humanity would be in control of its own destiny for the first time .
