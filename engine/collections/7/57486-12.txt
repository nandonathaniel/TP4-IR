Skeps , baskets placed open - end - down , have been used to house bees for some 2000 years . Initially they were made from wicker plastered with mud and dung but from the Middle Ages they were made of straw . In northern and western Europe , skeps were made of coils of grass or straw . In its simplest form , there is a single entrance at the bottom of the skep . Again , there is no internal structure provided for the bees and the colony must produce its own honeycomb , which is attached to the inside of the skep . Skeps have two disadvantages ; beekeepers can not inspect the comb for diseases and pests , and honey removal is difficult and often results in the destruction of the entire colony . To get the honey beekeepers either drove the bees out of the skep or , by the use of a bottom extension called an eke or a top extension called a cap , sought to create comb with just honey in it . Quite often the bees were just killed , sometimes using lighted sulfur , to allow the honeycomb to be removed . Skeps could also be squeezed in a vise to extract the honey . As of 1998 , most US states prohibited the use of skeps because they can not be inspected for disease and parasites .
