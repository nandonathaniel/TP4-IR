Benedict of Nursia is the most influential of Western monks and is called `` the father of western monasticism '' . He was educated in Rome but soon sought the life of a hermit in a cave at Subiaco , outside the city . He then attracted followers with whom he founded the monastery of Monte Cassino around 520 , between Rome and Naples . He established the Rule , adapting in part the earlier anonymous Rule of the Master ( Regula magistri ) , which was written somewhere south of Rome around 500 , and defined the activities of the monastery , its officers , and their responsibilities . By the ninth century , largely under the inspiration of the Emperor Charlemagne , Benedict 's Rule became the basic guide for Western monasticism .
