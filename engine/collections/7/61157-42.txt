Humans have inhabited the Columbia 's watershed for more than 15,000 years , with a transition to a sedentary lifestyle based mainly on salmon starting about 3,500 years ago . In 1962 , archaeologists found evidence of human activity dating back 11,230 years at the Marmes Rockshelter , near the confluence of the Palouse and Snake rivers in eastern Washington . In 1996 the skeletal remains of a 9,000 - year - old prehistoric man ( dubbed Kennewick Man ) were found near Kennewick , Washington . The discovery rekindled debate in the scientific community over the origins of human habitation in North America and sparked a protracted controversy over whether the scientific or Native American community was entitled to possess and / or study the remains .
