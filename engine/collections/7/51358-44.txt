Swift 's notion of inverted burial might seem the highest flight of fancy , but it appears that among English millenarians the idea that the world would be `` turned upside down '' at the Apocalypse enjoyed some currency . There is at least one attested case of a person being buried upside down by instruction ; a Major Peter Labilliere of Dorking ( d . 4 June 1800 ) lies thus upon the summit of Box Hill . Similar stories have attached themselves to other noted eccentrics , particularly in southern England , but not always with a foundation in truth .
