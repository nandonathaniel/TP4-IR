Owing to drainage of surface and groundwater in the project area , which waters may be salinized and polluted by agricultural chemicals like biocides and fertilizers , the quality of the river water below the project area can deteriorate , which makes it less fit for industrial , municipal and household use . It may lead to reduced public health . Polluted river water entering the sea may adversely affect the ecology along the sea shore ( see Aswan dam ) .
