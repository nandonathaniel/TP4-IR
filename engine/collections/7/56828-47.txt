Lou Gehrig 's streak started as a pinch - hitter . The next day he started at first base in place of slumping Wally Pipp and stayed there for fourteen years . On July 14 , 1934 , Gehrig , suffering from an attack of lumbago , was listed in the Yankee lineup at shortstop . He batted in the top of the first inning to preserve the streak , singled , and was promptly removed from the game . Gehrig 's streak was ended by amyotrophic lateral sclerosis , the disease that would take his life . His physical abilities rapidly declining , Gehrig told manager Joe McCarthy to take him out of the lineup on May 2 , 1939 . He never played again , dying in 1941 .
