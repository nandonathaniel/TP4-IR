Alfred Tennyson would later recall the shocked reaction in Britain when word was received of Byron 's death . The Greeks mourned Lord Byron deeply , and he became a hero . The national poet of Greece , Dionysios Solomos , wrote a poem about the unexpected loss , named To the Death of Lord Byron . Βύρων , the Greek form of `` Byron '' , continues in popularity as a masculine name in Greece , and a town near Athens is called Vyronas in his honour .
