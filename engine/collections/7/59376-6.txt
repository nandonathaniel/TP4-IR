Resolution can also be defined electrically , and expressed in volts . The minimum change in voltage required to guarantee a change in the output code level is called the least significant bit ( LSB ) voltage . The resolution Q of the ADC is equal to the LSB voltage . The voltage resolution of an ADC is equal to the voltage range of the ADC that can be coded divided by the number of intervals coded ( e.g. 255 for an 8 - bit ADC ) . This is equivalent to the ADC reference voltage ( this takes into account Vref - max and Vref - min as the upper / lower extreme values which can not be coded ) divided by the full number of intervals ( e.g. 256 for an 8 - bit ADC ) :
