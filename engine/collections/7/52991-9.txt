In general , DNA polymerases are highly accurate , with an intrinsic error rate of less than one mistake for every 10 nucleotides added . In addition , some DNA polymerases also have proofreading ability ; they can remove nucleotides from the end of a growing strand in order to correct mismatched bases . Finally , post-replication mismatch repair mechanisms monitor the DNA for errors , being capable of distinguishing mismatches in the newly synthesized DNA strand from the original strand sequence . Together , these three discrimination steps enable replication fidelity of less than one mistake for every 10 nucleotides added .
