Laws governing the material support of terrorism proved contentious . It was criticized by the EFF for infringement of freedom of association . The EFF argues that had this law been enacted during Apartheid , U.S. citizens would not have been able to support the African National Congress ( ANC ) as the EFF believes the ANC would have been classed as a terrorist organization . They also used the example of a humanitarian social worker being unable to train Hamas members how to care for civilian children orphaned in the conflict between Israelis and Palestinians , a lawyer being unable to teach IRA members about international law , and peace workers being unable to offer training in effective peace negotiations or how to petition the United Nations regarding human rights abuses .
