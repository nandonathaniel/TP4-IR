The Han Chinese used astronomical studies mainly to construct and revise their calendar . In contrast to the Julian calendar ( 46 BCE ) and Gregorian calendar ( 1582 CE ) of the West ( but like the Hellenic calendars of Classical Greece ) , the Chinese calendar is a lunisolar calendar , meaning that it uses the precise movements of the Sun and Moon as time - markers throughout the year . In the 5th century BCE during the Spring and Autumn period , the Chinese established the Sifen calendar ( 古 四 分 历 ) , which measured the tropical year at 365 ⁄ days ( like the Julian calendar of Rome ) . Emperor Wu replaced this with the new Taichu calendar ( 太初 历 ) in 104 BCE which measured the tropical year at 365 ⁄ days and the lunar month at 29 ⁄ days . Since the Taichu calendar had become inaccurate over two centuries , Emperor Zhang of Han ( r . 75 -- 88 CE ) halted its use and revived use of the Sifen calendar . Later , astronomer Guo Shoujing ( 1233 -- 1316 CE ) would set the tropical year at 365.2425 days for his Shoushi calendar ( 授時 曆 ) , the same value used in the Gregorian calendar . Besides the use of the calendar for regulating agricultural practices throughout the seasons , it was also used to mark important dates in the Sexagenary cycle -- constructed by celestial stems ( gan 干 ) and Earthly Branches ( zhi 支 ) , each of the latter associated with an animal of the Chinese zodiac .
