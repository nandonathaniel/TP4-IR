Climate varies throughout the Great Basin by elevation , latitude , and other factors . Higher elevations tend to be cooler and receive more precipitation . The western areas of the basin tend to be drier than the eastern areas because of the rain shadow of the Sierra Nevada . Most of the basin experiences a semi-arid or arid climate with warm summers and cold winters . However , some of the mountainous areas in the basin are high enough in elevation to experience an Alpine climate . Due to the region 's altitude and aridity , most areas in the Great Basin experience a substantial Diurnal temperature variation .
