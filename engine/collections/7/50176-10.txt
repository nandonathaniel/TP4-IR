As the alveoli increase in size , the surfactant becomes more spread out over the surface of the liquid . This increases surface tension effectively slowing the rate of expansion of the alveoli . This also helps all alveoli in the lungs expand at the same rate , as one that expands more quickly will experience a large rise in surface tension slowing its rate of expansion . It also means the rate of shrinking is more regular , as if one reduces in size more quickly the surface tension will reduce more , so other alveoli can contract more easily than it can . Surfactant reduces surface tension more readily when the alveoli are smaller because the surfactant is more concentrated .
