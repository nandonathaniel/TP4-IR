Egypt is rich in building and decorative stone , copper and lead ores , gold , and semiprecious stones . These natural resources allowed the ancient Egyptians to build monuments , sculpt statues , make tools , and fashion jewelry . Embalmers used salts from the Wadi Natrun for mummification , which also provided the gypsum needed to make plaster . Ore - bearing rock formations were found in distant , inhospitable wadis in the eastern desert and the Sinai , requiring large , state - controlled expeditions to obtain natural resources found there . There were extensive gold mines in Nubia , and one of the first maps known is of a gold mine in this region . The Wadi Hammamat was a notable source of granite , greywacke , and gold . Flint was the first mineral collected and used to make tools , and flint handaxes are the earliest pieces of evidence of habitation in the Nile valley . Nodules of the mineral were carefully flaked to make blades and arrowheads of moderate hardness and durability even after copper was adopted for this purpose . Ancient Egyptians were among the first to use minerals such as sulfur as cosmetic substances .
