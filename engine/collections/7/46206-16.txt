The firm 's first major breakthrough occurred in 1866 when Richard and George introduced an improved cocoa into Britain . A new cocoa press developed in the Netherlands removed some of the unpalatable cocoa butter from the cocoa bean . The firm began exporting its products in the 1850s . In 1861 , the company created Fancy Boxes -- a decorated box of chocolates -- and in 1868 they were sold in boxes in the shape of a heart for Valentine 's Day . Boxes of filled chocolates quickly became associated with the holiday .
