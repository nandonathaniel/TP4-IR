Since there is no real consensus about where to draw the exact line between Spaghetti Westerns and other Eurowesterns ( or other Westerns in general ) one can not say which one of the films mentioned so far really was the first Spaghetti Western . However , it is obvious that 1964 saw the breakthrough of this genre , with more than twenty productions or co-productions from Italian companies and also more than half a dozen Westerns by Spanish or Spanish / American companies . Furthermore , by far the most commercially successful of this lot was Sergio Leone 's A Fistful of Dollars whose innovations in cinematic style , music , acting , and story decided the future for the genre .
