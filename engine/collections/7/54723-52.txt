Entering Super Bowl XXIX , most sports writers and fans thought the Chargers had absolutely no chance of defeating the 49ers . San Francisco was on track , winning 12 of its last 13 games , including their playoff victories . Many people also thought that the NFC Championship Game between the 49ers and the Cowboys was `` the real Super Bowl '' , because those two teams were commonly viewed as vastly superior to any AFC team . Furthermore , San Francisco crushed San Diego , 38 -- 15 , during the regular season . Therefore , the 49ers entered the game favored to win by a 181‚ÅÑ2 points margin , surpassing the 18 point spread in which the Baltimore Colts were favored over the New York Jets in Super Bowl III more than two decades prior .
