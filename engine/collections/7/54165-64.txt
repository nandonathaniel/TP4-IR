As the tomb dates back more than 5000 years , and has been pillaged , repeatedly , from antiquity to modern times , it is amazing that anything useful could be discovered in it . Because of the repeated disturbances in Umm el - Qa'ab , many articles of Narmer 's were found in other graves , and objects of other kings , were recovered in Narmer 's grave . However , Flinders Petrie during the period 1899 - 1903 , and , starting in the 1970 's , the German Archaeological Institute ( DAI ) have made discoveries of the greatest importance to the history of Early Egypt by their re-excavation of the tombs of Umm el - Qa'ab .
