Veronica Harrington ( Angela Robinson ) : Although refined , composed , and classy on the surface , Veronica ( wife of David and mother of Jeffrey ) is actually an extremely no - holds - barred , vicious , malicious , cold , calculating , coercive , manipulative , overbearing , antagonistic , and catty snob underneath it all . She 's used to delivering zingers in her trademarked cool , calm , collected yet trenchant , stinging , and outwitting fashion . Very obdurate , she has proven to be set in her anti-gay and diabolic ways . Resulting from the character 's very one - of - a-kind brand of villainy and vile levels she 's proven more than willing to stoop to , Veronica has been advertised by OWN and various media outlets as `` The Ice Queen .
