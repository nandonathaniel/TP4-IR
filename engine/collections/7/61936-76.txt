The American ATF 's Project Gunrunner has a stated that the official objective is to stop the sale and export of guns from the United States into Mexico in order to deny Mexican drug cartels the firearms considered `` tools of the trade '' . However , in February 2011 , it brought about a scandal when the project was accused of accomplishing the opposite by ATF permitting and facilitating `` straw purchase '' firearm sales to traffickers , and allowing the guns to `` walk '' and be transported to Mexico . Several of the guns sold under the Project Gunrunner were recovered from crime scenes in Arizona , and at crime scenes throughout Mexico , resulting in considerable controversy .
