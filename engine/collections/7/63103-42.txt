Since the last great ice age , the Rocky Mountains were home first to indigenous peoples including the Apache , Arapaho , Bannock , Blackfoot , Cheyenne , Coeur d'Alene , Kalispel , Crow Nation , Flathead , Shoshone , Sioux , Ute , Kutenai ( Ktunaxa in Canada ) , Sekani , Dunne - za , and others . Paleo - Indians hunted the now - extinct mammoth and ancient bison ( an animal 20 % larger than modern bison ) in the foothills and valleys of the mountains . Like the modern tribes that followed them , Paleo - Indians probably migrated to the plains in fall and winter for bison and to the mountains in spring and summer for fish , deer , elk , roots , and berries . In Colorado , along the crest of the Continental Divide , rock walls that Native Americans built for driving game date back 5,400 -- 5,800 years . A growing body of scientific evidence indicates that indigenous people had significant effects on mammal populations by hunting and on vegetation patterns through deliberate burning .
