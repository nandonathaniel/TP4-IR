Pink decides to finish this wall as a result of his rage after his wife 's betrayal . He states that he has seen `` the writing on the wall '' . He concludes that he no longer needs anything at all , dismissing the people in his life as just `` bricks in the wall '' . The song also contains the line `` I do n't need no drugs to calm me '' , possibly foreshadowing what is going to happen in the song `` Comfortably Numb '' , although Waters has stated that `` Comfortably Numb '' is not about drugs .
