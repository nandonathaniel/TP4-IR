The definition of a built area depends on the definition of a locality , or `` taajama '' in Finnish , which is a cluster of buildings with no less than 200 inhabitants , where the buildings are no more than 200 meters apart . This means that some areas within towns and cities may not fill the definition , making it legal to drink alcohol in public there , while some areas outside of towns and cities may have high enough population densities to be considered localities , therefore making public drinking illegal . Entering or leaving localities is marked by road signs along the major thoroughfares .
