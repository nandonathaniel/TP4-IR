In R. v. Singh ( 163 C.R.R. ( 2d ) 280 ) , a person in police custody invoked his right to silence 18 times , and after each invocation , the police continued to browbeat the detained subject with further questioning , implying that his claim of a right to silence was either ineffective or meaningless . The Canadian Supreme Court ruled that this police behavior did not violate the right to silence , so the evidence obtained could be admitted . It is important to note that most rights in Canada can be limited by s . 1 of the Charter , which permits rights to be reduced if they interfere with substantial government interests , or by s . 24 of the Charter .
