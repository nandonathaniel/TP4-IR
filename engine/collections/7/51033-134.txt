Animals are multicellular eukaryotes , and are distinguished from plants , algae , and fungi by lacking cell walls . All animals are motile , if only at certain life stages . All animals except sponges have bodies differentiated into separate tissues , including muscles , which move parts of the animal by contracting , and nerve tissue , which transmits and processes signals .
