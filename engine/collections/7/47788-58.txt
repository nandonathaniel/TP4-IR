This was the first Super Bowl since Super Bowl XXXVII that did not feature the New England Patriots , Indianapolis Colts , or the Pittsburgh Steelers as the AFC representatives . Baltimore defeated the Colts and Patriots during the playoffs while the Steelers failed to make the playoffs . By contrast , the NFC had a different member go to the Super Bowl almost every year during that same span , with the New York Giants ( who won Super Bowls XLII and XLVI ) being the only NFC team to make two appearances during that span . With the 49ers making their first Super Bowl appearance since Super Bowl XXIX , this left the Dallas Cowboys ( last appeared in Super Bowl XXX ) , Detroit Lions ( never appeared in a Super Bowl ) , Minnesota Vikings ( last appeared in Super Bowl XI ) and Washington Redskins ( last appeared in Super Bowl XXVI ) as the only NFC teams not to play in a Super Bowl since 1998 , with only the Vikings ( on three occasions ) even advancing to the NFC Championship Game .
