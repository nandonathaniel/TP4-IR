William DuBay , in Gay Identity : The Self Under Ban , describes gay identity as one strategy for dealing with society 's oppression . It solves some problems but creates many more , replacing a closet of secrecy with one of gay identity . A better strategy , he suggests , is to reject the label and live as if the oppression did not exist . Quoting Goffman , he writes , `` But of course what is a good adjustment for the individual can be an even better one for society . ''
