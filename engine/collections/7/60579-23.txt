A common misconception is that microwave ovens cook food `` from the inside out '' , meaning from the center of the entire mass of food outwards . This idea arises from heating behavior seen if an absorbent layer of water lies beneath a less absorbent drier layer at the surface of a food ; in this case , the deposition of heat energy inside a food can exceed that on its surface . This can also occur if the inner layer has a lower heat capacity than the outer layer causing it to reach a higher temperature , or even if the inner layer is more thermally conductive than the outer layer making it feel hotter despite having a lower temperature . In most cases , however , with uniformly structured or reasonably homogenous food item , microwaves are absorbed in the outer layers of the item at a similar level to that of the inner layers . Depending on water content , the depth of initial heat deposition may be several centimetres or more with microwave ovens , in contrast to broiling / grilling ( infrared ) or convection heating -- methods which deposit heat thinly at the food surface . Penetration depth of microwaves is dependent on food composition and the frequency , with lower microwave frequencies ( longer wavelengths ) penetrating further .
