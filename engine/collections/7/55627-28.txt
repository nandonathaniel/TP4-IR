Plants , especially trees , continue to hold an important interest for the Waodani . Their store of botanical knowledge is extensive , ranging from knowledge of materials to poisons to hallucinogens to medicines . They also relate plants to their own experiences , particularly that of growing . Among trees , certain kinds are auspicious . Canopy trees , with their distinctly colored young leaves and striking transformation as they mature to towering giants , are `` admired for their solitary character ... as well as for their profuse entanglement '' with other plants . Other significant trees are the pioneer species of the peach palm ( used for making spears and blowguns , as well as for fruit ) , and fast - growing balsa wood , used for ceremonial purposes . Peach palm trees are associated with past settlements and the ancestors who live there .
