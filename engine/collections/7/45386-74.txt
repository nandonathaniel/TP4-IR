Werblin 's partners , Townsend B. Martin , Leon Hess , Donald C. Lillis , and Philip H. Iselin , had a falling out with Werblin over the way the team was run -- though the franchise had begun to make a profit , Werblin was making all the policies and decisions himself with little or no input from his partners , much to their dismay . Though Werblin initially resisted their ultimatum to dissolve the partnership , Werblin agreed to be bought out in 1968 . Werblin remained involved in the sports community and became the first chairman and CEO of the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority where he helped to create the Meadowlands Sports Complex , including Giants Stadium .
