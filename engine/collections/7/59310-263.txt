The Act also provided for the establishment of civil parishes . The 1894 Act formed an official system of civil parishes , separated from the ecclesiastical parishes , to carry on some of these responsibilities ( others being transferred to the district / county councils ) . However , the civil parishes were not a complete third - tier of local government . Instead , they were ' community councils ' for smaller , rural settlements , which did not have a local government district to themselves . Where urban parish councils had previously existed , they were absorbed into the new urban districts .
