As part of the 2011 Act , Postcomm was merged into the communications regulator Ofcom on 1 October 2011 , with Ofcom introducing a new simplified set of regulations for postal services on 27 March 2012 . On 31 March 2012 , the Government took over the historic assets and liabilities of the Royal Mail pension scheme , relieving Royal Mail of its huge pensions deficit . On 1 April 2012 , Post Office Ltd became independent of Royal Mail Group and was reorganised to become a subsidiary of Royal Mail Holdings , with a separate management and board of directors . A 10 - year inter-business agreement was signed between the two companies to allow Post Offices to continue issuing stamps and handling letters and parcels for Royal Mail . The Act also contained the option for Post Office Ltd to become a mutual organisation in the future .
