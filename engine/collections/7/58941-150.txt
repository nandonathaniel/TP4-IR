In the Bhakti tradition within Hinduism , it is believed that execution of devotional service to God leads to the development of Love for God ( taiche bhakti - phale krsne prema upajaya ) , and as love for God increases in the heart , the more one becomes free from material contamination ( krishna - prema asvada haile , bhava nasa paya ) . Being perfectly in love with God or Krishna makes one perfectly free from material contamination. and this is the ultimate way of salvation or liberation . In this tradition , salvation or liberation is considered inferior to love , and just an incidental by - product . Being absorbed in Love for God is considered to be the perfection of life .
