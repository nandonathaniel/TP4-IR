According to Kundalini yoga , Ganesha resides in the first chakra , called Muladhara ( mūlādhāra ) . Mula means `` original , main '' ; adhara means `` base , foundation '' . The muladhara chakra is the principle on which the manifestation or outward expansion of primordial Divine Force rests . This association is also attested to in the Ganapati Atharvashirsa . Courtright translates this passage as follows : `` You continually dwell in the sacral plexus at the base of the spine ( mūlādhāra cakra ) . '' Thus , Ganesha has a permanent abode in every being at the Muladhara . Ganesha holds , supports and guides all other chakras , thereby `` governing the forces that propel the wheel of life '' .
