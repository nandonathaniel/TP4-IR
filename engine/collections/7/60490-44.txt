In 2015 , the NFL once again scheduled the Packers to play on Sunday Night Football , this time against the Broncos at Sports Authority Field on November 1 . Both the Packers and the Broncos entered the game undefeated at 6 - 0 . However , this game wound up being scheduled opposite the fifth ( and final ) game of the 2015 World Series between the Royals and the NY Mets that night . Both the Packers and the Broncos have a baseball team in their respective home states ( Wisconsin 's Milwaukee Brewers and Colorado 's Rockies ) , but both of those MLB teams performed poorly that season .
