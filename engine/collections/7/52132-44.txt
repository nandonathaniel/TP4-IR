Early practitioners of experimental psychology distinguished themselves from parapsychology , which in the late nineteenth century enjoyed great popularity ( including the interest of scholars such as William James ) , and indeed constituted the bulk of what people called `` psychology '' . Parapsychology , hypnotism , and psychism were major topics of the early International Congresses . But students of these fields were eventually ostractized , and more or less banished from the Congress in 1900 -- 1905 . Parapsychology persisted for a time at Imperial University , with publications such as Clairvoyance and Thoughtography by Tomokichi Fukurai , but here too it was mostly shunned by 1913 .
