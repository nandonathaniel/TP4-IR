In Ireland , Starbucks ' subsidiary Ritea only paid € 35,000 in tax between 2005 and 2011 and the subsidiary recorded losses in every year other than 2011 . Ritea is owned by Netherlands - based Starbucks Coffee Emea . Their French and German subsidiaries make large losses because they are heavily in debt to the Dutch subsidiary , which charges them higher interest rates than the group pays to borrow . Reuters calculated that without paying interest on the loans and royalty fees , the French and German subsidiaries would have paid € 3.4 million in tax . The Dutch subsidiary that royalties are paid to made a € 507,000 profit in 2011 from revenues of € 73 million , while the company that roasts coffee made a profit of € 2 million in 2011 and paid tax of € 870,000 .
