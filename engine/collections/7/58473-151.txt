In Japan , most of the schools run a three - term school year ( trimester system ) , and most universities and colleges have a semester system . The exact date of the beginning of the summer break and its duration vary across regions , but commonly the break lasts for about six weeks . The break originated to avoid the heat in summer , so elementary , middle , and high schools in Hokkaid≈ç and Nagano Prefecture tend to have a shorter summer break than the rest of schools in Japan .
