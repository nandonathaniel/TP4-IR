There is debate in the literature as to what determines age - hypogamy in sexual relationships . A number of variables have been argued to influence the likelihood of women entering into an age - hypogamous relationship such as ; racial or ethnic background , level of education , income , marital status , conservatism , age and number of sexual partners . For example , it was found that in US Census data that African American communities showed an imbalanced sex ratio , whereby there were 100 African American woman for every 89 African American Males . Support for this evidence was then found in regard to marriage , whereby it was shown that African American women were more likely to be in age - hypogamous or age - hypergamous marriages in comparison with White American women . However , more recent evidence has found that women of other - race categories , outside of African or white American women were more likely to sleep with younger men , showing that it is still unclear which , if any ethnic groups , are more likely to have age - hypogamous relationships .
