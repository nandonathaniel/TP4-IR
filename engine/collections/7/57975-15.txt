Cadorette and two friends , whom she had known since they were in dance school as children , decided to take up dancing again and share their craft and experience . They formed `` The Chapeau Rouge Dance Project '' encouraging former , retired , ( and often older ) dance students to attend classes in the dance studio that they rented .
