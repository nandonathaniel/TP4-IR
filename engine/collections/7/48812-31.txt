`` It hurt to write this finale . It literally hurt me . Because in order to write these episodes , I had to walk in the shoes of ( the shooter ) . I had to think like a shooter . A person who would shoot Reed and Alex and Charles . A person who would shoot Derek . By the time I finished writing part one , I was sick . And depressed . Because my McDreamy was lying on my beloved catwalk dying . Mer is screaming and he is dying . And , before you have me shot up with Thorazine and placed in a strait jacket , yes , I DO I know it 's only a TV show , I 'm not insane , but dude ... it felt too real . It felt WAY too real . ''
