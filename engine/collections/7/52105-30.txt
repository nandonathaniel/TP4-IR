Size . The number of characters in a data item value is checked ; for example , an ISBN must consist of 10 characters only ( in the previous version -- the standard for 1997 and later has been changed to 13 characters . ) Format checks . Data must conform to a specified format . Thus , the first 9 characters must be the digits 0 through 9 ' the 10th must be either those digits or an X Consistency . Codes in the data items which are related in some way can thus be checked for the consistency of their relationship . The first number of the ISBN designates the language of publication . for example , books published in French - speaking countries carry the digit `` 2 '' . This must match the address of the publisher , as given elsewhere in the record . Range . Does not apply to ISBN , but typically data must lie within maximum and minimum preset values . For example , customer account numbers may be restricted within the values 10000 to 20000 , if this is the arbitrary range of the numbers used for the system . Check digit . An extra digit calculated on , for example , an account number , can be used as a self - checking device . When the number is input to the computer , the validation program carries out a calculation similar to that used to generate the check digit originally and thus checks its validity . This kind of check will highlight transcription errors where two or more digits have been transposed or put in the wrong order . The 10th character of the 10 - character ISBN is the check digit .
