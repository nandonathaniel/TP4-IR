The first U.S. national soccer team was constituted in 1885 , when it played Canada in the first international match held outside the United Kingdom . Canada defeated the U.S. 1 -- 0 in Newark , New Jersey . The U.S. had its revenge the following year when it beat Canada 1 -- 0 , also in Newark , although neither match was officially recognized . The U.S. earned both silver and bronze medals in men 's soccer at the 1904 St. Louis Summer Olympics through Christian Brothers College and St. Rose Parish , though the tournament is declared official only by the IOC ( FIFA does n't endorse tournaments held before 1908 ) . The U.S. played its first official international match under the auspices of U.S. Soccer on August 20 , 1916 , against Sweden in Stockholm , where the U.S. won 3 -- 2 .
