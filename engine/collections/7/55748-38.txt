In 1998 , silicone hydrogels became available . These materials have both the extremely high oxygen permeability of silicone and the comfort and clinical performance of the conventional hydrogels . Because silicone allows more oxygen permeability than water , oxygen permeability of silicone hydrogels is not tied to the lenses ' water content . Lenses have now been developed with so much oxygen permeability that they are approved for overnight wear ( extended wear ) . Lenses approved for daily wear are also available in silicone hydrogel materials .
