This model suggests that Scandinavia experienced a population boom just before the Viking Age began . The agricultural capacity of the land was not enough to keep up with the increasing population . As a result , many Scandinavians found themselves with no property and no status . To remedy this , these landless men took to piracy to obtain material wealth . The population continued to grow , and the pirates looked further and further beyond the borders of the Baltic , and eventually into all of Europe .
