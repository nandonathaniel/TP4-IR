The Eiffel Tower was the world 's tallest structure when completed in 1889 , a distinction it retained until 1929 when the Chrysler Building in New York City was topped out . The tower has lost its standing both as the world 's tallest structure and the world 's tallest lattice tower but retains its status as the tallest freestanding ( non-guyed ) structure in France .
