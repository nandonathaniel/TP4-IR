Cleveland Browns VP / GM Sashi Brown John Dorsey Brown was fired on December 7 . Brown , who had served as the team 's lawyer since 2013 , was given the duties of general manager in 2016 despite no prior experience in football . He was considered responsible for trading away the high round draft picks that ended up being Carson Wentz and Deshaun Watson . In addition , he failed to follow through on a trade for Bengals backup quarterback AJ McCarron , which was contributed to him simply failing to inform the league of the trade in time . Owner Jimmy Haslam said the coach Hue Jackson will stay at least through the 2018 season . Later that day the Browns named former Kansas City Chiefs GM John Dorsey as their new GM . As general manager in Kansas City from 2013 -- 16 , the Chiefs recorded a 43 -- 21 (. 672 ) record .
