By 1919 , Rieu was very ill and had to be brought home . He was replaced by Geoffrey Cumberlege and Noel Carrington . Noel was the brother of Dora Carrington , the artist , and even got her to illustrate his Stories Retold edition of Don Quixote for the Indian market . Their father Charles Carrington had been a railway engineer in India in the nineteenth century . Noel Carrington 's unpublished memoir of his six years in India is in the Oriental and India Office Collections of the British Library . By 1915 there were makeshift depots at Madras and Calcutta . In 1920 , Noel Carrington went to Calcutta to set up a proper branch . There he became friendly with Edward Thompson who involved him in the abortive scheme to produce the ' Oxford Book of Bengali Verse ' . In Madras , there was never a formal branch in the same sense as Bombay and Calcutta , as the management of the depot there seems to have rested in the hands of two local academics .
