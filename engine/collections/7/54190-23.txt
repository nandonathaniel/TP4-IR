During the early history of the Solar System , the asteroids melted to some degree , allowing elements within them to be partially or completely differentiated by mass . Some of the progenitor bodies may even have undergone periods of explosive volcanism and formed magma oceans . However , because of the relatively small size of the bodies , the period of melting was necessarily brief ( compared to the much larger planets ) , and had generally ended about 4.5 billion years ago , in the first tens of millions of years of formation . In August 2007 , a study of zircon crystals in an Antarctic meteorite believed to have originated from 4 Vesta suggested that it , and by extension the rest of the asteroid belt , had formed rather quickly , within ten million years of the Solar System 's origin .
