The abundance of elements in the Sun and outer planets is similar to that in the universe . Due to solar heating , the elements of Earth and the inner rocky planets of the Solar System have undergone an additional depletion of volatile hydrogen , helium , neon , nitrogen , and carbon ( which volatilizes as methane ) . The crust , mantle , and core of the Earth show evidence of chemical segregation plus some sequestration by density . Lighter silicates of aluminum are found in the crust , with more magnesium silicate in the mantle , while metallic iron and nickel compose the core . The abundance of elements in specialized environments , such as atmospheres , or oceans , or the human body , are primarily a product of chemical interactions with the medium in which they reside .
