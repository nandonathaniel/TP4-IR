Within each atom , electrons exist in an area around the nucleus . This area is called the electron cloud . According to Bohr 's model of the atom , electrons have a high velocity , and the larger the nucleus they are orbiting the faster they would need to move . If electrons ' move ' about the electron cloud in strict paths the same way planets orbit the sun , then electrons would be required to do so at speeds which far exceed the speed of light . However , there is no reason that one must confine one 's self to this strict conceptualization , that electrons move in paths the same way macroscopic objects do . Rather one can conceptualize electrons to be ' particles ' that capriciously exist within the bounds of the electron cloud . Inside the atomic nucleus , the protons and neutrons are also probably moving around due to the electrical repulsion of the protons and the presence of angular momentum of both particles .
