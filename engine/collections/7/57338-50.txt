In 278 BC , the city , along with the rest of central Anatolia , was occupied by a Celtic group , the Galatians , who were the first to make Ankara one of their main tribal centers , the headquarters of the Tectosages tribe . Other centers were Pessinos , today 's Balhisar , for the Trocmi tribe , and Tavium , to the east of Ankara , for the Tolstibogii tribe . The city was then known as Ancyra . The Celtic element was probably relatively small in numbers ; a warrior aristocracy which ruled over Phrygian - speaking peasants . However , the Celtic language continued to be spoken in Galatia for many centuries . At the end of the 4th century , St. Jerome , a native of Dalmatia , observed that the language spoken around Ankara was very similar to that being spoken in the northwest of the Roman world near Trier .
