At the end of the war in Europe , in May 1945 , the Soviets insisted on occupying the Danish island of Bornholm , due to its strategic position at the entrance to the Baltic . When the local German commander insisted on surrendering to the Western Allies , as did German forces in the rest of Denmark , the Soviets bombed the island , causing heavy casualties and damage among a civilian population which was only lightly touched throughout the war , and then invaded the island and occupied it until mid-1946 - all of which can be considered as initial moves in the Cold War .
