Education being a provincial responsibility , there is no Canadian national standard . In Canada the school year for elementary and high school consists of 178 to 200 days , depending on jurisdiction , but several days may be deducted from this total for professional development and administrative duties , resulting in approximately 187 teaching days per year for most jurisdictions . Elementary students receive approximately 950 hours of instruction and secondary students receive approximately 1000 hours per year .
