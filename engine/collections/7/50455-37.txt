The Old Trafford pitch is surrounded by four covered all - seater stands , officially known as the Sir Alex Ferguson ( North ) , East , Sir Bobby Charlton ( South ) and West Stands . Each stand has at least two tiers , with the exception of the Sir Bobby Charlton Stand , which only has one tier due to construction restrictions . The lower tier of each stand is split into Lower and Upper sections , the Lower sections having been converted from terracing in the early 1990s .
