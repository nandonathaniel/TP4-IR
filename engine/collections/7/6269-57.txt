Williams signed with MGM Records in 1947 and released `` Move It on Over '' , which became a massive country hit . In 1948 he moved to Shreveport , Louisiana , and he joined the Louisiana Hayride , a radio show broadcast that propelled him into living rooms all over the southeast appearing on weekend shows . Williams eventually started to host a show on KWKH and started touring across western Louisiana and eastern Texas , always returning on Saturdays for the weekly broadcast of the Hayride . After a few more moderate hits , in 1949 he released his version of the 1922 Cliff Friend & Irving Mills song `` Lovesick Blues '' , made popular by Rex Griffin . Williams ' version became a huge country hit ; the song stayed at number one on the Billboard charts over four consecutive months , crossing over to mainstream audiences and gaining Williams a place in the Grand Ole Opry . On June 11 , 1949 , Williams made his debut at the Grand Ole Opry , where he became the first performer to receive six encores . He brought together Bob McNett ( guitar ) , Hillous Butrum ( bass ) , Jerry Rivers ( fiddle ) and Don Helms ( steel guitar ) to form the most famous version of the Drifting Cowboys , earning an estimated US $1,000 per show ( equivalent to US $10,285.3 in 2018 ) . That year Audrey Williams gave birth to Randall Hank Williams ( Hank Williams Jr . ) . During 1949 , he joined the first European tour of the Grand Ole Opry , performing in military bases in England , Germany and the Azores . Williams released seven hit songs after `` Lovesick Blues '' , including `` Wedding Bells '' , `` Mind Your Own Business '' , `` You 're Gonna Change ( Or I 'm Gonna Leave ) '' , and `` My Bucket 's Got a Hole in It '' .
