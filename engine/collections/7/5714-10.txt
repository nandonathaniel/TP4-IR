Additionally , in the 2005 edition , certain foods always came with one coupon which could be used at either Best Buy , Toys R Us , or Foot Locker ( including online stores ) . The value of each coupon was random , with Toys R Us coupons ranging from $1 to $5 ; up to $5 in coupons could be used in a single transaction . In 2008 , these coupons were redeemed for up to 25 % off any Foot Locker item ( s ) . Since 2009 , the promotion has not featured any coupons .
