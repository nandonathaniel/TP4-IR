In Greek mythology , the Milky Way was formed after the trickster god Hermes suckled the infant Heracles at the breast of Hera , the queen of the gods , while she was asleep . When Hera awoke , she tore Heracles away from her breast and splattered her breast milk across the heavens . In another version of the story , Athena , the patron goddess of heroes , tricked Hera into suckling Heracles voluntarily , but he bit her nipple so hard that she flung him away , spraying milk everywhere .
