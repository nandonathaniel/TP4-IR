In evaluating the UN as a whole , Jacques Fomerand writes that the `` accomplishments of the United Nations in the last 60 years are impressive in their own terms . Progress in human development during the 20th century has been dramatic and the UN and its agencies have certainly helped the world become a more hospitable and livable place for millions . '' Evaluating the first 50 years of the UN 's history , the author Stanley Meisler writes that `` the United Nations never fulfilled the hopes of its founders , but it accomplished a great deal nevertheless '' , citing its role in decolonization and its many successful peacekeeping efforts . The British historian Paul Kennedy states that while the organization has suffered some major setbacks , `` when all its aspects are considered , the UN has brought great benefits to our generation and ... will bring benefits to our children 's and grandchildren 's generations as well .
