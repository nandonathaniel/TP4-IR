The battle in the nebula was a difficult sequence to accomplish without the aid of computer - generated models . The swirling nebula was created by injecting a latex rubber and ammonia mixture into a cloud tank filled with fresh and salt water . All the footage was shot at two frames per second to give the illusion of faster movement . The vibrant abstract colors of the nebula were simulated by lighting the tank using colored gels . Additional light effects such as auroras were created by the ILM animation department . Using matte work , the ships were physically stuck on a background plate to complete the shot . The destruction of the Reliant 's engine nacelle was created by superimposing shots of the engine blowing apart and explosions over the model .
