Feeling slighted , Jerry invites Milo to the art students ' masked ball and kisses her . At the raucous party , with everyone in black - and - white costumes , Milo learns from Adam that Jerry is not interested in her , and Henri overhears Jerry and Lise saying goodbye to each other . When Henri and Lise drive away , Jerry daydreams about being with Lise all over Paris to the tune of the George Gershwin composition An American in Paris . His reverie is broken by a car horn , the sound of Henri bringing Lise back to him . They embrace as the Gershwin composition ( and the film ) ends .
