When police raided Burke 's bungalow , they found a large trunk containing a bullet - proof vest , almost $320,000 in bonds recently stolen from a Wisconsin bank , two Thompson submachine guns , pistols , two shotguns , and thousands of rounds of ammunition . St. Joseph authorities immediately notified the Chicago police , who requested that both machine guns be brought there at once . Through the then relatively new science of forensic ballistics , both weapons were determined to have been used in the massacre -- and that one of Burke 's Tommy guns had also been used to murder New York mobster Frankie Yale ( who participated in O'Banion's murder ) a year and a half earlier . Unfortunately , no further concrete evidence would surface in the massacre case . Burke would be captured over a year later on a Missouri farm . As the case against him in the murder of Officer Skelly was strongest , he was tried in Michigan and subsequently sentenced to life imprisonment . Burke died in prison in 1940 .
