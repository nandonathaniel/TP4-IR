Officer Dawn Lerner , portrayed by Christine Woods , is the strict leader of the hospital , enforcing the rules with her group of fellow officers ( who are the only occupants of the hospital to possess weapons ) . She believes that everyone must contribute to `` the greater good '' and keep the hospital operation running long enough for the military to come save them , and often uses this mentality as a form of guilt in order to persuade those that they capture into doing work for the hospital once they recover . Though she is aware of Gorman 's treatment of female patients , she does little to stop it . Lerner also treats the patients cruelly herself , repeatedly taking out her anger on Beth by striking her for the slightest mistakes or misunderstandings . Despite Beth 's attempts to convince her that help will never come , Lerner refuses to believe it and insists that things will get better eventually , and it is far better to live under her rule than in the wilderness outside . Though she is furious at Beth for ( as Lerner believes ) killing Gorman and Joan as well as aiding Noah in his escape , she still refuses to kill or exile Beth , as she needs the extra help around the hospital . Though she tries to develop a bond with Beth , Beth is ultimately convinced that Lerner will never change , and her vision of a better future clouds her reasonable judgment . In the prisoner exchange at the end of `` Coda , '' when Beth stabs Lerner in the shoulder with a pair of scissors , Lerner reacts impulsively in a moment of shock and her gun discharges , firing a single bullet directly through Beth 's head and killing her instantly . Although Lerner pleads for mercy , Daryl shoots her directly in the forehead immediately afterward .
