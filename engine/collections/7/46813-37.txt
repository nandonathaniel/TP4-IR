In addition to its structuralist roots , dependency theory has much overlap with Neo-Marxism and World Systems Theory , which is also reflected in the work of Immanuel Wallerstein , a famous dependency theorist . Wallerstein rejects the notion of a Third World , claiming that there is only one world which is connected by economic relations ( World Systems Theory ) . He argues that this system inherently leads to a division of the world in core , semi-periphery and periphery . One of the results of expansion of the world - system is the commodification of things , like natural resources , labor and human relationships .
