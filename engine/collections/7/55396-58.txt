By the end of the 3rd century , much had changed . The loss of many pre-consular functions and the gradual encroachment of the equites into the traditional senatorial administrative and military functions , meant that senatorial careers virtually vanished prior to their appointment as consuls . This had the effect of seeing a suffect consulship granted at an earlier age , to the point that by the 4th century , it was being held by men in their early twenties , and possibly younger , without the significant political careers behind them that was normal previously . As time progressed , second consulates , usually ordinary , became far more common than had been the case during the first two centuries , while the first consulship was usually a suffect consulate . Also , the consulate during this period was no longer just the province of senators -- the automatic awarding of a suffect consulship to the equestrian praetorian prefects ( who were given the ornamenta consularia upon achieving their office ) allowed them to style themselves cos. II when they were later granted an ordinary consulship by the emperor . All this had the effect of further devaluing the office of consul , to the point that by the final years of the 3rd century , holding an ordinary consulate was occasionally left out of the cursus inscriptions , while suffect consulships were hardly ever recorded by the first decades of the 4th century .
