Having received national recognition after the Monterey Pop Festival , Big Brother was booked by Columbia for engagements around the country . A well - known band on the West Coast ( especially in San Francisco ) , Big Brother played their first East Coast concert in New York City on February 17 , 1968 , at the Anderson Theater , 66 Second Avenue . Columbia 's marketing department featured Janis Joplin as the star ; before that time , some of the band 's audience regarded James Gurley as of equal or more importance . In New York the press criticized the band for playing out of tune and for amplifiers set at maximum volume . The Village Voice , while noting that `` ears came out ringing '' after the Saturday night performance , cited Joplin as ranking in sex appeal with Jim Morrison and Jimi Hendrix , and praised `` her belting , groovy style , '' mixing Bessie Smith , Aretha Franklin and James Brown . `` At times she seemed to be singing harmony with herself . '' Thanks in part to Ryder 's salesmanship and persistence , Big Brother was the first band to play in the legendary Fillmore East , in New York City , on March 8 , 1968 .
