Molecular symmetry in chemistry describes the symmetry present in molecules and the classification of molecules according to their symmetry . Molecular symmetry is a fundamental concept in chemistry , as it can be used to predict or explain many of a molecule 's chemical properties , such as its dipole moment and its allowed spectroscopic transitions . Many university level textbooks on physical chemistry , quantum chemistry , and inorganic chemistry devote a chapter to symmetry .
