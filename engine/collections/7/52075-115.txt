When first discovered , particle diffraction was a source of great puzzlement . Are `` particles '' really `` waves ? '' In the early experiments , the diffraction patterns were detected holistically by means of a photographic plate , which could not detect individual particles . As a result , the notion grew that particle and wave properties were mutually incompatible , or complementary , in the sense that different measurement apparatuses would be required to observe them . That idea , however , was only an unfortunate generalization from a technological limitation . Today it is possible to detect the arrival of individual electrons , and to see the diffraction pattern emerge as a statistical pattern made up of many small spots ( Tonomura et al. , 1989 ) . Evidently , quantum particles are indeed particles , but whose behaviour is very different from classical physics would have us to expect .
