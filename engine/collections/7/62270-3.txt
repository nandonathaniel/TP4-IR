Attempts to formalize the principles of the empirical sciences use an interpretation to model reality , in the same way logicians axiomatize the principles of logic . The aim of these attempts is to construct a formal system that will not produce theoretical consequences that are contrary to what is found in reality . Predictions or other statements drawn from such a formal system mirror or map the real world only insofar as these scientific models are true .
