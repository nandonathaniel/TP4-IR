ASICS Ltd. began as Onitsuka Co. , Ltd on September 1 , 1949 . Its founder , Kihachiro Onitsuka , began manufacturing basketball shoes in his home town of Kobe , Hyogo Prefecture , Japan . Soon after the range of sports activities widened to a variety of Olympic styles used throughout the ' 50s , ' 60s and ' 70s by athletes worldwide . Onitsuka became particularly renowned for the Mexico 66 design , in which the distinctive crossed stripes , now synonymous with the company brand , were featured for the first time . In 1977 , Onitsuka Tiger merged with GTO and JELENK to form ASICS Corporation . Despite the name change , a vintage range of ASICS shoes are still produced and sold internationally under the Onitsuka Tiger label .
