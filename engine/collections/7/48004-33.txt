Danish commercial wind power development stressed incremental improvements in capacity and efficiency based on extensive serial production of turbines , in contrast with development models requiring extensive steps in unit size based primarily on theoretical extrapolation . A practical consequence is that all commercial wind turbines resemble the Danish model , a light - weight three - blade upwind design .
