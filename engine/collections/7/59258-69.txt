Douglas , a moderate on the slavery issue who favored `` popular sovereignty '' , was ahead on the first ballot , but needed 56.5 more votes to secure the nomination . On the 57th ballot , Douglas was still ahead , but 51.5 votes short of the nomination . In desperation , the delegates agreed on May 3 to stop voting and adjourn the convention .
