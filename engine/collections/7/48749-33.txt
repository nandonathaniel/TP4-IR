In the 1860s , men started wearing wider neckties that were tied in a bow or looped into a loose knot and fastened with a stickpin . Frock coats were shortened to knee - length and were worn for business , while the mid-thigh length sack coat slowly displaced the frock coat for less - formal occasions . Top hats briefly became the very tall `` stovepipe '' shape , but a variety of other hat shapes were popular .
