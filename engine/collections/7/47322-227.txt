The author of the First Epistle of Peter identifies himself in the opening verse as `` Peter , an apostle of Jesus Christ '' , and the view that the epistle was written by St. Peter is attested to by a number of Church Fathers : Irenaeus ( 140 -- 203 ) , Tertullian ( 150 -- 222 ) , Clement of Alexandria ( 155 -- 215 ) and Origen of Alexandria ( 185 -- 253 ) . Unlike The Second Epistle of Peter , the authorship of which was debated in antiquity , there was little debate about Peter 's authorship of this first epistle until the 18th century . Although 2 Peter internally purports to be a work of the apostle , many biblical scholars have concluded that Peter is not the author . For an early date and ( usually ) for a defense of the Apostle Peter 's authorship see Kruger , Zahn , Spitta , Bigg , and Green .
