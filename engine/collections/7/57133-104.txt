An explanation for why the expansion of the Universe is accelerating remains elusive . It is often attributed to `` dark energy '' , an unknown form of energy that is hypothesized to permeate space . On a mass -- energy equivalence basis , the density of dark energy ( ~ 7 Ã— 10 g / cm ) is much less than the density of ordinary matter or dark matter within galaxies . However , in the present dark - energy era , it dominates the mass -- energy of the universe because it is uniform across space .
