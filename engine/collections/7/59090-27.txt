Rainbow sharks are compatible with barbs and rainbowfish , which are upper - and middle - tank dwellers . They can also live with danios , loaches , plecos , rasboras , and gouramis . They are not compatible with smaller , more timid fish in the tank , as the sharks may terrorize them by chasing them from their territory .
