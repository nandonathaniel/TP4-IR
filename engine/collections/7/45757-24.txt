Howe 's `` Battle Hymn of the Republic '' was first published on the front page of The Atlantic Monthly of February 1862 . The sixth verse written by Howe , which is less commonly sung , was not published at that time . The song was also published as a broadside in 1863 by the Supervisory Committee for Recruiting Colored Regiments in Philadelphia .
