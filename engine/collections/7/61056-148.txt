`` Ponce√±os have always been a breed apart from other Puerto Ricans . Their insularity and haughtiness are legendary , and some Puerto Ricans claim that even the dialect in Ponce is slightly different from that spoken in the rest of the Island . They are also racially different : you 'll see more people of African descent in Ponce than anywhere else in the Island except Loiza . ''
