The boys ran to town for help , and several men , including local businessman Watson Stanley Fisher , 24 , came to investigate . Fisher and others dived into the creek to find Stilwell , believing him to have suffered a seizure . After locating the boy 's body and attempting to return to shore , Fisher was also bitten by the shark in front of the townspeople , losing Stilwell in the process . His right thigh was severely injured and he bled to death at Monmouth Memorial Hospital in Long Branch at 5 : 30 p.m. Stilwell 's body was recovered 150 feet ( 46 m ) upstream from the Wyckoff dock on July 14 .
