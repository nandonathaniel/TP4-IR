Pennsylvania accommodated 500 Acadians . Because they arrived unexpectedly , the Acadians had to remain in port on their vessels for months . Virginia refused to accept the Acadians on grounds that no notice was given of their arrival . They were detained at Williamsburg , where hundreds died from disease and malnutrition . They were then sent to Britain where they were held as prisoners until the Treaty of Paris in 1763 .
