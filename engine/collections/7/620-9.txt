It may begin with an introduction , which is , in general , slower than the main movement . In terms of structure , introductions are an upbeat before the main musical argument . The first required section is the exposition . The exposition presents the primary thematic material for the movement : one or two themes or theme groups , often in contrasting styles and in opposing keys , connected by a modulating transition . The exposition typically concludes with a closing theme , a codetta , or both . The exposition is followed by the development where the harmonic and textural possibilities of the thematic material are explored . The development then re-transitions back to the recapitulation where the thematic material returns in the tonic key , and for the recapitulation to complete the musical argument , material that has not been stated in the tonic key is `` resolved '' by being played , in whole or in part , in the tonic . The movement may conclude with a coda , beyond the final cadence of the recapitulation .
