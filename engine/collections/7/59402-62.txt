Thomas Jackson was the third child of Julia Beckwith ( n√©e Neale ) Jackson ( 1798 -- 1831 ) and Jonathan Jackson ( 1790 -- 1826 ) , an attorney . Both of Jackson 's parents were natives of Virginia . The family already had two young children and were living in Clarksburg , in what is now West Virginia , when Thomas was born . He was named for his maternal grandfather . There is some dispute about the actual location of Jackson 's birth . A historical marker on the floodwall in Parkersburg , West Virginia , claims that he was born in a cabin near that spot when his mother was visiting her parents who lived there . There are writings which indicate that in Jackson 's early childhood , he was called `` The Real Macaroni '' , though the origin of the nickname and whether it really existed are unclear .
