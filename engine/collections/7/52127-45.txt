Emmet , Wyldstyle , and Vitruvius evade Bad Cop 's forces with the aid of Batman , Wyldstyle 's boyfriend . They go to the hidden Cloud Cuckoo Land , a realm where minifigures can create whatever they desire , to attend a council of Master Builders , all of whom are unimpressed with Emmet and refuse to fight Business . Bad Cop 's forces attack , having placed a tracking device on Emmett , and capture everyone except Emmet and a small team of Master Builders . Escaping , Emmet devises a plan to infiltrate Business 's office tower and disarm the Kragle , but the group is captured and imprisoned in the Think Tank , where all the Master Builders are forced to make instructions . Trying to retaliate , Vitruvius is decapitated by Business , who sets a self - destruct protocol and leaves everyone to die , including Bad Cop . As he dies , Vitruvius reveals he made up the prophecy . He soon reappears to Emmet as a ghost and tells him that his belief makes him the Special . Strapped to the self - destruct mechanism 's battery , Emmet jumps into the abyss outside the tower and severs the connection , saving his friends . Inspired by Emmet 's sacrifice , Wyldstyle rallies the Lego people across the universe to use whatever creativity they have to build machines and weapons to fight against Lord Business 's forces .
