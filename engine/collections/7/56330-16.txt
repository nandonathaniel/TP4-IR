In Exodus 21 , as in the Code of Hammurabi , the concept of reciprocal justice seemingly applies to social equals ; the statement of reciprocal justice `` life for life , eye for eye , tooth for tooth , hand for hand , foot for foot , burn for burn , wound for wound , stripe for stripe '' is followed by an example of a different law : if a slave - owner blinds the eye or knocks out the tooth of a slave , the slave is freed but the owner pays no other consequence . On the other hand , the slave would probably be put to death for the injury of the eye of the slave - owner .
