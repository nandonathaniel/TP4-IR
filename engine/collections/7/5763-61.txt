DeSanto viewed that all the characters in Christmas with the Kranks would wear dresses that are supposed to serve as their `` accents '' rather than overtly defining them . Luther Krank is seen wearing the same - colored shirt and suit at work all the time , and according to DeSanto , this `` tells that Luther 's a punch - the - clock kind of guy , so the whole idea of skipping Christmas and going off on a tropical vacation is completely averse to anything he 's ever done . '' She described Nora as `` tasteful and kind of folksy , a middle - American woman approaching middle age . In our first meeting , Jamie Lee Curtis was totally prepared . She wanted to look like a real Midwestern woman who lives in the suburbs of Chicago and is as obsessed with Christmas as everyone around her . Nora dresses for the seasons and I found out by speaking to people at Marshall Field 's in Chicago that the Christmas sweater is a big deal . And Jamie wears it so well . '' As for Vic Frohmeyer , she saw him as `` a sort of commander - in - chief of the neighborhood , so I wanted something with a bit of a military flair . Since he 's also a college professor , we cut the pattern from a general 's jacket and made it professorial by using a vintage tweed mixed with corduroy . ''
