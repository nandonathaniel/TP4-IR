In 1950 , the U.S. Congress granted Puerto Ricans the right to organize a constitutional convention via a referendum that gave them the option of voting their preference , `` yes '' or `` no '' , on a proposed U.S. law that would organize Puerto Rico as a `` commonwealth '' that would continue United States sovereignty over Puerto Rico and its people . Puerto Rico 's electorate expressed its support for this measure in 1951 with a second referendum to ratify the constitution . The Constitution of Puerto Rico was formally adopted on July 3 , 1952 . The Constitutional Convention specified the name by which the body politic would be known .
