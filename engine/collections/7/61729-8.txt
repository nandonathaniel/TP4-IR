Russian was once widely spoken in Alaska as it was the language of administration , commerce , and the settlers there that often intermarried with the locals ( they numbered no more than a thousand ) , creating a sizable biracial population . The language began to decline after the United States purchased the land from the Russian Empire . Despite this , the language , called `` Old Russian '' by its speakers , is still spoken today in parts of Alaska like Ninilchik and Kodiak by descendants of Russian colonists and Russified Alaskan Natives and is known for its archaic Russian vocabulary and indigenous influences , though the vast majority of them are elderly , meaning that this unique Russian dialect is heavily endangered . In addition , there has been sizable , recent immigration from Russia in the past few decades , leading to a new generation of Russian - speaking Alaskans . Additionally , a Russian creole / mixed language , known as Medny Aleut language , was once spoken in some of the Aleutian Islands . Only a few elderly people still speak it .
