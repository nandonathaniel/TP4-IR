Early Egyptians knew how to assemble planks of wood into a ship hull and had mastered advanced forms of shipbuilding as early as 3000 BC . The Archaeological Institute of America reports that the oldest planked ships known are the Abydos boats . A group of 14 discovered ships in Abydos were constructed of wooden planks `` sewn '' together . Discovered by Egyptologist David O'Connor of New York University , woven straps were found to have been used to lash the planks together , and reeds or grass stuffed between the planks helped to seal the seams . Because the ships are all buried together and near a mortuary belonging to Pharaoh Khasekhemwy , originally they were all thought to have belonged to him , but one of the 14 ships dates to 3000 BC , and the associated pottery jars buried with the vessels also suggest earlier dating . The ship dating to 3000 BC was 75 feet ( 23 m ) long and is now thought to perhaps have belonged to an earlier pharaoh . According to professor O'Connor , the 5,000 - year - old ship may have even belonged to Pharaoh Aha .
