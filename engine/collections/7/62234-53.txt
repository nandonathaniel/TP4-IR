The iconoclastic period has drastically reduced the number of survivals of Byzantine art from before the period , especially large religious mosaics , which are now almost exclusively found in Italy and Saint Catherine 's Monastery in Egypt . Important works in Thessaloniki were lost in the Great Thessaloniki Fire of 1917 and the Greco - Turkish War ( 1919 -- 1922 ) . A large mosaic of a church council in the Imperial Palace was replaced by lively secular scenes , and there was no issue with imagery per se . The plain Iconoclastic cross that replaced a figurative image in the apse of St Irene 's is itself an almost unique survival , but careful inspection of some other buildings reveals similar changes . In Nicaea , photographs of the Church of the Dormition , taken before it was destroyed in 1922 , show that a pre-iconoclasm standing Theotokos was replaced by a large cross , which was itself replaced by the new Theotokos seen in the photographs . The Image of Camuliana in Constantinople appears to have been destroyed , as mentions of it cease .
