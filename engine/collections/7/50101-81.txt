IIT - JEE was conducted only in English and Hindi , which was criticised as making it harder for students where regional languages , like Tamil , Telugu , Kannada , Urdu , Oriya , Bengali , Marathi , Assamese or Gujarati , are more prominent . In September 2011 , the Gujarat High Court acted on a Public Interest Litigation by the Gujarati Sahitya Parishad , demanding the exams be conducted in Gujarati . A second petition was made in October by Navsari 's Sayaji Vaibhav Sarvajanik Pustakalaya Trust . Another petition was made at the Madras High Court for conducting the exam in Tamil . In the petition , it was claimed that not conducting the exam in the regional languages is in violation of article 14 of the Constitution of India . PMK , a political party in Tamil Nadu held a demonstration at Chennai for conducting IIT - JEE and other national entrance exams in regional languages also , particularly Tamil in Tamil Nadu . Pattali Makkal Katchi party has filed Public Interest Litigation in Madras High Court for conducting IIT JEE entrance exam in Tamil also . They submitted that every year 7.63 lakh students were completing 12th standard in Tamil Nadu , 75 % of them from Tamil Medium . They had to take the entrance exam in English or Hindi , neither of which was their medium of instruction nor their mother tongue , and so were denied their fundamental right to take up the entrance exam in their medium of instruction , based on their mother tongue. Shiv Sena urged MHRD to conduct IITJEE and other national undergraduate entrance exams in regional languages , particularly Marathi language in Maharashtra . Most of the JEE controversies sparked the nation as the exam is very well known . In 2017 , the supreme court ordered JAB to put a bar on the ongoing counseling process . There were three questions comprising a total of 11 marks that were unclear .
