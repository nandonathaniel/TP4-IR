If temperature and pressure are kept constant , then the volume of the gas is directly proportional to the number of molecules of gas . If the temperature and volume remain constant , then the pressure of the gas changes is directly proportional to the number of molecules of gas present . If the number of gas molecules and the temperature remain constant , then the pressure is inversely proportional to the volume . If the temperature changes and the number of gas molecules are kept constant , then either pressure or volume ( or both ) will change in direct proportion to the temperature .
