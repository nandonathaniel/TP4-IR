In April 2006 , the Flames announced that they would be opening a hybrid restaurant , bar and entertainment facility in downtown Calgary on Stephen Avenue . In announcing the venture , Flames ' President and CEO Ken King stated : `` While hockey remains our core competency , we are constantly seeking new opportunities in which to grow the Flames brand and allow our fans greater opportunities to enjoy hockey . We believe establishing a location outside of the Pengrowth Saddledome to share food , fun and hockey will bring our fans even closer to the team . '' One year later , in April 2007 , Flames Central opened to the public . In 2017 , the facility reverted to its original name of The Palace Theatre .
