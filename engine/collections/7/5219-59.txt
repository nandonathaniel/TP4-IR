The phrase `` to form a more perfect Union '' has been construed as referring to the shift to the Constitution from the Articles of Confederation . In this transition , the `` Union '' was made `` more perfect '' by the creation of a federal government with enough power to act directly upon citizens , rather than a government with narrowly limited power that could act on citizens ( e.g. , by imposing taxes ) only indirectly through the states . Although the Preamble speaks of perfecting the `` Union , '' and the country is called the `` United States of America , '' the Supreme Court has interpreted the institution created as a government over the people , not an agreement between the States . The phrase has also been interpreted to confirm that state nullification of any federal law , dissolution of the Union , or secession from it , are not contemplated by the Constitution .
