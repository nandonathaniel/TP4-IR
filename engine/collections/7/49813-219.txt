Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi had concluded that instead of taking in millions of refugees , it was economical to go to war against Pakistan . As early as 28 April 1971 , the Indian Cabinet had asked General Manekshaw ( Chairman of the Chiefs of Staff Committee ) to `` Go into East Pakistan '' . Hostile relations in the past between India and Pakistan added to India 's decision to intervene in Pakistan 's civil war . Resultantly , the Indian government decided to support the creation of a separate state for ethnic Bengalis by supporting the Mukti Bahini . For this , RAW , helped to organise , train and arm these insurgents . Consequently , the Mukti Bahini succeeded in harassing Pakistani military in East Pakistan , thus creating conditions conducive for a full - scale Indian military intervention in early December .
