In Torcaso v. Watkins ( 1961 ) , the Supreme Court ruled that the Constitution prohibits states and the federal government from requiring any kind of religious test for public office . In the Board of Education of Kiryas Joel Village School District v. Grumet ( 1994 ) , The Court concluded that `` government should not prefer one religion to another , or religion to irreligion . '' In a series of cases in the first decade of the 2000s -- Van Orden v. Perry ( 2005 ) , McCreary County v. ACLU ( 2005 ) , and Salazar v. Buono ( 2010 ) -- the Court considered the issue of religious monuments on federal lands without reaching a majority reasoning on the subject .
