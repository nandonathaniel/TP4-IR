Sangji 's family was unhappy with the terms of the settlement with Harran . Sangji 's sister , Naveen , has called the sanctions against Harran and UCLA `` barely a slap on the wrist . '' The Sangji 's family remarked , `` ( t ) his settlement , like the previous one with UCLA , is barely a slap on the wrist for the responsible individual . '' She noted that previous safety violations in his lab were not corrected before her sister 's death and that UCLA had ignored the `` wake - up calls '' of earlier accidents in other labs . She decried the nearly $4.5 million in legal fees -- enough to buy 86,000 lab coats . `` Had UCLA spent even a tiny fraction of this money and effort on laboratory and chemical safety training and fire resistant gear ... Sheri might still be with us today , '' Naveen said .
