During the annual Gopher Festival , Rapunzel is booed by a man in the crowd when she shows her new emblem to the people of Corona . After finding out that the person who booed her is an eldery shopkeeper who everyone loves , Rapunzel is determined to uncover Uncle Monty 's disapproval of her , even if it means disguising herself . Eventually she inspires Monty to participate at the Gopher Festival Tournament , but during the race she has to rescue him from a waterfall , resulting in blowing her disguise . Monty tells her that he boooed her because he does n't like all these new changes in the kingdom that occurred due to her return as a princess and the two remain enemies , but respect each other . Monty wins the race and Rapunzel booos him as a sign of their `` special relationship '' . At his sweets shop , Monty looks very proud at his trophy , realising he would n't have won if it had n't been Rapunzel to help him follow his dream .
