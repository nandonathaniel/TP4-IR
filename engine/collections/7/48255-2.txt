The impetus for the reforms lay in abuses thought to be a result of secular interference in the monasteries and of the Church 's tight integration with the feudal and manorial systems . Since a Benedictine monastery required land , it needed the patronage of a local lord . However , the lord would often demand rights and assert prerogatives that interfered with the operation of the monastery . Patrons normally retained a proprietary interest and expected to install their kinsmen as abbots . Local aristocrats often established churches , monasteries , and convents that they then considered as family property , taking revenues from them , and leaving the monks that remained subsisting in poverty .
