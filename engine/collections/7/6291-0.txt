Seat belt legislation in Canada is left to the provinces . All provinces in Canada have primary enforcement seat belt laws , which allow a police officer to stop and ticket a driver if s / he observes a violation . Ontario was the first province to pass a law which required vehicle occupants to wear seat belts , a law that came into effect on January 1 , 1976 .
