Some cultural disputes exist between Malaysia and neighbouring Indonesia . The two countries share a similar cultural heritage , sharing many traditions and items . However , disputes have arisen over things ranging from culinary dishes to Malaysia 's national anthem . Strong feelings exist in Indonesia about protecting that nation 's national heritage . The rivalry between the two countries began during Konfrontasi just after Malaysian independence , when Indonesia and Malaysia were almost at war . Building resentment since then coupled with the economic success of Malaysia mean these feelings are still strong in Indonesia today . The Malaysian government and the Indonesian government have met to defuse some of the tensions resulting from the overlaps in culture . Feelings are not as strong in Malaysia , where most recognise that many cultural values are shared .
