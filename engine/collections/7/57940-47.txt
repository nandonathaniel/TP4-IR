In 2010 , two gigantic spherical bubbles of high energy emission were detected to the north and the south of the Milky Way core , using data from the Fermi Gamma - ray Space Telescope . The diameter of each of the bubbles is about 25,000 light - years ( 7.7 kpc ) ; they stretch up to Grus and to Virgo on the night - sky of the southern hemisphere . Subsequently , observations with the Parkes Telescope at radio frequencies identified polarized emission that is associated with the Fermi bubbles . These observations are best interpreted as a magnetized outflow driven by star formation in the central 640 ly ( 200 pc ) of the Milky Way .
