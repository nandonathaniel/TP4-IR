Just as the transfer of hydrogen ions between chemical species determines the pH of an aqueous solution , the transfer of electrons between chemical species determines the reduction potential of an aqueous solution . Like pH , the reduction potential represents how strongly electrons are transferred to or from species in solution . It does not characterize the amount of electrons available for oxidation or reduction , in much the same way that pH does not characterize the buffering capacity .
