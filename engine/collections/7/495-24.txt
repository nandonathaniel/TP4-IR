Some organisms employ even more radical variants of photosynthesis . Some archea use a simpler method that employs a pigment similar to those used for vision in animals . The bacteriorhodopsin changes its configuration in response to sunlight , acting as a proton pump . This produces a proton gradient more directly , which is then converted to chemical energy . The process does not involve carbon dioxide fixation and does not release oxygen , and seems to have evolved separately from the more common types of photosynthesis .
