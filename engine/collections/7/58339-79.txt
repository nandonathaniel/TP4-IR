The focus on the new concept of `` theocratic '' leadership was accompanied by statements that the structure was not actually new : The Watch Tower declared that `` a governing body made its appearance '' some time after the formation of Zion 's Watch Tower Society in 1884 , though it had not been referred to as such at the time . The article stated that Watch Tower Society president Charles Taze Russell had been a member of the governing body . The 1972 Yearbook of Jehovah 's Witnesses stated that following Rutherford 's death in 1942 `` one of the first things that the governing body decided upon was the inauguration of the Theocratic Ministry School '' and added that the `` governing body '' had published millions of books and Bibles in the previous thirty years . Former member of the Governing Body , Raymond Franz , stated that the actions of presidents Russell , Rutherford and Knorr in overriding and failing to consult with directors proved the Bible Students and Jehovah 's Witnesses had been under a monarchical rule until 1976 , leaving no decisions to any `` governing body '' .
