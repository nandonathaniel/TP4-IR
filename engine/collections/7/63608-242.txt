Plants protect themselves from frost and dehydration stress with antifreeze proteins , heat - shock proteins and sugars ( sucrose is common ) . LEA ( Late Embryogenesis Abundant ) protein expression is induced by stresses and protects other proteins from aggregation as a result of desiccation and freezing .
