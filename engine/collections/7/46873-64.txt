The United States Department of Homeland Security was created in 2002 . On March 9 , 2006 , pursuant to the renewal of the Patriot Act as Pub. L. 109 -- 177 , the Secretary of Homeland Security was added to the line of succession . The order of Cabinet members in the line has always been the same as the order in which their respective departments were established . Despite custom , many in Congress had wanted the Secretary to be placed at number eight on the list -- below the Attorney General , above the Secretary of the Interior , and in the position held by the Secretary of the Navy prior to the creation of the Secretary of Defense -- because the Secretary , already in charge of disaster relief and security , would presumably be more prepared to take over the presidency than some of the other Cabinet secretaries . Despite this , the 2006 law explicitly specifies that the `` Secretary of Homeland Security '' follows the `` Secretary of Veterans Affairs '' in the succession , effectively at the end of the list .
