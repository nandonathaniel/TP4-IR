American troops took the tactical offensive in most Mexican War battles with great success , and they suffered fairly light losses . Unfortunately , similar tactics proved to be obsolete in the Civil War in part because of the innovation of the rifle musket . This new weapon greatly increased the infantry 's range and accuracy and loaded as fast as a musket . By the beginning of the Civil War , rifle muskets were available in moderate numbers . It was the weapon of choice in both the Union and Confederate armies during the war ; by 1864 , the vast majority of infantry troops on both sides had rifle muskets of good quality .
