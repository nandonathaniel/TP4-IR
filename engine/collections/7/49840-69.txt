The Odrysian Kingdom was a union of Thracian tribes under the kings of the powerful Odrysian tribe centered around the region of Thrace . Various parts of Thrace were under Macedonian rule under Philip II of Macedon , Alexander the Great , Lysimachus , Ptolemy II , and Philip V but were also often ruled by their own kings . The Thracians and Agrianes were widely used by Alexander as peltasts and light cavalry , forming about one fifth of his army . The Diadochi also used Thracian mercenaries in their armies and they were also used as colonists . The Odrysians used Greek as the language of administration and of the nobility . The nobility also adopted Greek fashions in dress , ornament and military equipment , spreading it to the other tribes . Thracian kings were among the first to be Hellenized .
