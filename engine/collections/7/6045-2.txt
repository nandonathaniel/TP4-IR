Proponents of the term GNU / Linux note that GNU alone would be just as good a name for GNU variants which combine the GNU operating system software with software from other sources . GNU / Linux is a term promoted by the Free Software Foundation ( FSF ) and its founder Richard Stallman . Proponents call for the correction of the more extended term , on the grounds that it does n't give credit to the major contributor and the associated free software philosophy . GNU is a longstanding project begun in 1984 to develop a free operating system . It is argued that when the Linux kernel was independently created in 1991 , it merely provided a substantial missing piece . Several distributions employ the FSF - endorsed name , such as Debian , Trisquel and Parabola GNU / Linux - libre .
