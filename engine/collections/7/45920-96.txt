Lions are generalist hypercarnivores and usually hunt in groups . Their prey consists mainly of mammals , particularly ungulates , with a preference for wildebeest , zebras , buffalo , gemsbok , and giraffes in Africa and chital , sambar deer , nilgai , wild boar , chinkara and chousingha in India . African lions prefer prey weighing 190 -- 550 kg ( 420 -- 1,210 lb ) . They generally avoid fully grown adult elephants , hippopotamuses and rhinoceroses , as well as very small prey like dik - dik , hyrax , hare and vervet monkey . However , Thomson 's gazelles may be hunted and warthogs are often taken depending on availability , despite being below the preferred weight range . In most areas , a small number of species may make up around three - fourths of the lion 's diet . In Serengeti National Park , wildebeest , zebras and gazelle are the majority of prey . In Kruger National Park , giraffes are the most common prey , and in Manyara Park , Cape buffaloes constitute as much as 62 % of the lion 's diet , due to the high number density of buffaloes . At the Okavango Delta , with its strong seasonal changes in prey , up to eight species may make up three quarters of a lion 's diet . Occasionally adult hippopotamus are taken at Gorongosa National Park and calves are commonly hunted at Virunga National Park . In addition to size , the aquatic nature of hippos makes them normally unavailable as prey . The lions of Savuti , Botswana , have adapted to hunting young elephants during the dry season , and a pride of 30 lions has been recorded killing individuals between the ages of four and eleven years . Lions also attack domestic livestock and in India cattle contribute significantly to their diet . Unusual prey items include porcupines and small reptiles . Lions will kill other predators such as leopards , cheetahs , and hyenas , but they seldom devour them .
