A wise and perceptive figure operating a somewhat shady cantina on the peaceful forest planet , Takodana . J.J. Abrams said Kanata has `` lived over a thousand years . She 's had this watering hole ... and it 's like another bar that you 'd find in a corner of the Star Wars universe . '' According to Abrams , the character was based on his former high school English teacher , Rose Gilbert , who lectured at the Palisades Charter High School from 1961 to 2013 . Abrams said the team `` really wanted the story to feel authentic , despite being a wild fantasy . I mentioned Rose in an early story meeting as a sort of timeless , wise figure that I 'd actually known in my life . ''
