Carry permits required ? No No ยง 61 - 7 - 4 ยง 61 - 7 - 7 As of May 24 , 2016 , West Virginia became a constitutional carry state . Any person 21 years or older who is legally able to own a handgun may carry the weapon concealed without the need of obtaining a permit . A permit is required for individuals 18 - 20 years old who wish to carry a handgun concealed . Carry permits are still issued on a `` shall issue '' basis to anyone who would like one for reciprocity purposes . As of October 2016 , there are 37 states that recognize WV permits for those 21 years or older , and of those 35 states , 16 recognize WV permits issued to persons 18 years or older . Note : 2 of the 37 states do n't officially recognize the WV permit , but are constitutional carry states , so no permit is required .
