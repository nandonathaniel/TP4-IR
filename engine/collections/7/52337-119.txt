The film aired in its uncut form ( minus the entr'acte ) on April 9 , 1995 , on NBC . Julie Andrews hosted the four - hour telecast which presented the musical numbers in a letterbox format . As the film 's home video availability cut into its television ratings , NBC let their contract lapse in 2001 . That year , the film was broadcast one time on the Fox network , in its heavily edited 140 - minute version . Since 2002 , the film has aired on ABC , generally during Christmas week , and has been broadcast on its sister cable network , ABC Family , periodically around Easter and other holidays . Most of its more recent runs have been the full version in a four - hour time slot , complete with the entr'acte . ABC first broadcast a high definition version on December 28 , 2008 . On December 22 , 2013 , the annual broadcast had its highest ratings since 2007 ; the increase in ratings were credited to NBC 's broadcast of The Sound of Music Live ! -- a live television adaptation of the original musical which aired earlier that month .
