In June 2014 , Connor 's Cure -- a non-profit charitable organization -- was established by Triple H and Stephanie McMahon , who have personally funded it through the Children 's Hospital of Pittsburgh Foundation . It is named in honor of Pittsburgh native Connor Mason Michalek ( October 17 , 2005 -- April 25 , 2014 ) who had died two months earlier from medulloblastoma , a rare tumor that affects the brain and spinal cord . Beginning in 2015 , WWE began recognizing September as Pediatric Cancer Awareness Month , adding a gold color scheme to the sets and ring ropes , and offering special Connor 's Cure merchandise , with the proceeds going to charity .
