A southern treeline exists in the New Zealand Subantarctic Islands and the Australian Macquarie Island , with places where mean annual temperatures above 5 째 C ( 41 째 F ) support trees and woody plants , and those below 5 째 C ( 41 째 F ) do n't . Another treeline exists in the southwestern most parts of the Magellanic subpolar forests ecoregion , where the forest merges into the subantarctic tundra ( termed Magellanic moorland or Magellanic tundra ) . For example , the northern halves of Hoste and Navarino Islands have Nothofagus antarctica forests but the southern parts consist of moorlands and tundra .
