Weston mentioned he had just that morning written a letter to Ansel Adams , looking for someone seeking to learn photography in exchange for carrying his bulky large - format camera and to provide a much needed automobile . There was a swift meeting of creative minds . For the remainder of 1947 through the beginning of 1948 , Dody commuted from San Francisco on weekends to learn from Weston the basics of photography . In early 1948 , Dody moved into `` Bodie House , '' the guest cottage at Edward 's Wildcat Hill compound , as his full - time assistant .
