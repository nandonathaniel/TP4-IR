In July 2004 , as a result of the publicity generated by Malan 's article and the subsequent documentary , the song became the subject of a lawsuit between Linda 's estate and Disney , claiming that Disney owed $1.6 million in royalties for the use of `` The Lion Sleeps Tonight '' in the film and musical stage productions of The Lion King . At the same time , the Richmond Organization began to pay $3,000 annually into Linda 's estate . In February 2006 , Linda 's descendants reached a legal settlement with Abilene Music Publishers , who held the worldwide rights and had licensed the song to Disney , to place the earnings of the song in a trust .
