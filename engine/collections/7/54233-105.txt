Researchers from the University of Lausanne and the University of Edinburgh have suggested that the `` Iterated Snowdrift Game '' may more closely reflect real - world social situations . Although this model is actually a chicken game , it will be described here . In this model , the risk of being exploited through defection is lower , and individuals always gain from taking the cooperative choice . The snowdrift game imagines two drivers who are stuck on opposite sides of a snowdrift , each of whom is given the option of shoveling snow to clear a path , or remaining in their car . A player 's highest payoff comes from leaving the opponent to clear all the snow by themselves , but the opponent is still nominally rewarded for their work .
