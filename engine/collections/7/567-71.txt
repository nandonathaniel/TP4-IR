The election of President and Vice President of the United States is an indirect election in which citizens of the United States who are registered to vote in one of the 50 U.S. states or in Washington , D.C. cast ballots not directly for those offices , but instead for members of the U.S. Electoral College , known as electors . These electors then in turn cast direct votes , known as electoral votes , for President , and for Vice President . The candidate who receives an absolute majority of electoral votes ( at least 270 out of a total of 538 , since the Twenty - Third Amendment granting voting rights to citizens of Washington , D.C. ) is then elected to that office . If no candidate receives an absolute majority of the votes for President , the House of Representatives chooses the winner ; if no one receives an absolute majority of the votes for Vice President , then the Senate chooses the winner .
