Internal party disunity compounded the difficulty of identifying lawmakers who might have informally functioned as a minority leader . For instance , `` seven of the fourteen speakership elections from 1834 through 1859 had at least twenty different candidates in the field . Thirty - six competed in 1839 , ninety - seven in 1849 , ninety - one in 1859 , and 138 in 1855 . '' With so many candidates competing for the speakership , it is not at all clear that one of the defeated lawmakers then assumed the mantle of `` minority leader . '' The Democratic minority from 1861 to 1875 was so completely disorganized that they did not `` nominate a candidate for Speaker in two of these seven Congresses and nominated no man more than once in the other five . The defeated candidates were not automatically looked to for leadership . ''
