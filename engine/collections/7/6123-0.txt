Steam is water in the gas phase , which is formed when water boils . Steam is invisible ; however , `` steam '' often refers to wet steam , the visible mist or aerosol of water droplets formed as this water vapour condenses . At lower pressures , such as in the upper atmosphere or at the top of high mountains , water boils at a lower temperature than the nominal 100 ° C ( 212 ° F ) at standard pressure . If heated further it becomes superheated steam .
