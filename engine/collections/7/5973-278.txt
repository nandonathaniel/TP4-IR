In December 1997 , the Academy hired veteran Oscar telecast producer Gil Cates to oversee the 1998 ceremony . `` Gil has become the consummate Oscar show producer , consistently garnering top television ratings for the telecast , '' said AMPAS president Robert Rehme in a press release announcing the selection . `` His shows are full of wit , charm and surprise . '' A few days later , actor and comedian Billy Crystal was chosen to emcee the upcoming telecast . Cates explained his reason to bring back the veteran comedian saying , `` Billy 's performance last year was spectacular . There is nobody like him . '' In an article published in USA Today he initially requested to Cates and AMPAS five months after the previous year 's ceremony that he would like to take a break from hosting duties . However , pressure from the Academy , Cates , and several friends and family members made him reconsider his decision . His sixth stint would make him second only to Bob Hope in number of ceremonies hosted .
