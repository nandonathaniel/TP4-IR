Biological ecologists have traditionally been reluctant to study human ecology gravitating instead to the allure of wild nature . Human ecology has a history of focusing attention on humans ' impact on the biotic world . Paul Sears was an early proponent of applying human ecology , addressing topics aimed at the population explosion of humanity , global resource limits , pollution , and published a comprehensive account on human ecology as a discipline in 1954 . He saw the vast `` explosion '' of problems humans were creating for the environment and reminded us that `` what is important is the work to be done rather than the label . '' `` When we as a profession learn to diagnose the total landscape , not only as the basis of our culture , but as an expression of it , and to share our special knowledge as widely as we can , we need not fear that our work will be ignored or that our efforts will be unappreciated .
