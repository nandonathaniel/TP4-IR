At its launch , the Xbox One did not have native backward compatibility with original Xbox or Xbox 360 games . Senior project management and planning director Albert Penello explained that Microsoft was initially considering a cloud gaming platform to enable backward compatibility , but he felt it would be `` problematic '' due to varying internet connection qualities . Xbox Live director of programming Larry `` Major Nelson '' Hryb did state that users could theoretically use the HDMI - in port on the console to pass an Xbox 360 ( or , alternatively , any other device that supports HDMI output , including competing consoles ) through Xbox One . This process does generate a small amount of unnoticeable display lag .
