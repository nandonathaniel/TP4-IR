James Ogilvie Fairlie was the principal organiser of the first Open Championship held at Prestwick in 1860 . With the untimely death of Allan Robertson , aged 43 in 1859 , Prestwick members decided to conduct a challenge the following year that would determine the land 's greatest golfer . In a proposed competition for a `` Challenge Belt '' , Fairlie sent out a series of letters to Blackheath , Perth , Edinburgh , Musselburgh and St Andrews , inviting a player known as a `` respectable caddie '' to represent each of the clubs in a tournament to be held on 17 October 1860 .
