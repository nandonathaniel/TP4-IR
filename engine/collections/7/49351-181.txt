Interstate H - 1 , which , coming into the city from the west , passes Hickam Air Force Base and Honolulu International Airport , runs just north of Downtown and continues eastward through Makiki and Kaimuki , ending at Waialae / Kahala . H - 1 connects to Interstate H - 2 from Wahiawa and Interstate H - 3 from Kaneohe , west of the CDP . Interstate H - 201 -- also known as the Moanalua Freeway and sometimes numbered as its former number , Hawai Ê»i State Rte. 78 -- connects two points along H - 1 : at Aloha Stadium and Fort Shafter . Close to H - 1 and Aloha Stadium , H - 201 has an exchange with the western terminus of Interstate H - 3 to the windward side of Oahu ( Kaneohe ) . This complex of connecting ramps , some directly between H - 1 and H - 3 , is in Halawa .
