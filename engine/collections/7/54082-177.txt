The Star Wars world , unlike fantasy and science - fiction films that featured sleek and futuristic settings , was portrayed as dirty and grimy . Lucas ' vision of a `` used future '' was further popularized in the science fiction - horror films Alien , which was set on a dirty space freighter ; Mad Max 2 , which is set in a post-apocalyptic desert ; and Blade Runner , which is set in a crumbling , dirty city of the future . Lucas made a conscious effort to parallel scenes and dialogue between films , and especially to parallel the journeys of Luke Skywalker with that of his father Anakin when making the prequels .
