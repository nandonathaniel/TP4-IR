Leopards are exceptionally adaptable , although associated primarily with savanna and rainforest . Populations thrive anywhere in the species range where grasslands , woodlands , and riverine forests remain largely undisturbed . In the Russian Far East , they inhabit temperate forests where winter temperatures reach a low of − 25 ° C ( − 13 ° F ) . They are equally adept surviving in some of the world 's most humid rainforests and even semi-arid desert edges .
