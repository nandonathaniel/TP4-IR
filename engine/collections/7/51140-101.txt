Composed by Jim Parker , the iconic main theme is a moderate - tempo waltz , performed ( primarily though not exclusively ) on an unusual electronic musical instrument , the theremin , which has a sound not unlike a low whistle or a human voice . The theremin part was played by Celia Sheen ( 1940 -- 2011 ) . From the 14th series onwards the soundtrack was altered so that during the closing titles a standardised version of the theme is played on a solo violin in place of the theremin . Occasionally a version with a longer introduction opens the show , using a flute rather than a theremin as the lead instrument .
