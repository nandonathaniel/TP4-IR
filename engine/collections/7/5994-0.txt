In the United States , there is no federal law regulating the practice of tattooing . However , all 50 states and the District of Columbia have statutory laws requiring a person receiving a tattoo be 18 years of age or older . This is partially based on the legal principle that a minor can not enter into a legal contract or otherwise render informed consent for a procedure . Most states permit a person under the age of 18 to receive a tattoo with permission of a parent or guardian , but some states outright prohibit tattooing under a certain age regardless of permission , with the exception of medical necessity ( such as markings placed for radiation therapy ) .
