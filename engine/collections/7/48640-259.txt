Importantly , Maimonides , while enumerating the above , added the following caveat : `` There is no difference between ( the Biblical statement ) ' his wife was Mehithabel ' ( Genesis 10 , 6 ) on the one hand ( i.e. , an `` unimportant '' verse ) , and ' Hear , O Israel ' on the other ( i.e. , an `` important '' verse ) ... anyone who denies even such verses thereby denies God and shows contempt for his teachings more than any other skeptic , because he holds that the Torah can be divided into essential and non-essential parts ... '' The uniqueness of the 13 fundamental beliefs was that even a rejection out of ignorance placed one outside Judaism , whereas the rejection of the rest of Torah must be a conscious act to stamp one as an unbeliever . Others , such as Rabbi Joseph Albo and the Raavad , criticized Maimonides ' list as containing items that , while true , in their opinion did not place those who rejected them out of ignorance in the category of heretic . Many others criticized any such formulation as minimizing acceptance of the entire Torah . As noted , however , neither Maimonides nor his contemporaries viewed these principles as encompassing all of Jewish belief , but rather as the core theological underpinnings of the acceptance of Judaism .
