All heavier elements ( including those necessary for rocky planets like the Earth , and for carbon - based or other life ) have thus been created since the Big Bang in stars which were hot enough to fuse helium itself . All elements other than hydrogen and helium today account for only 2 % of the mass of atomic matter in the universe . Helium - 4 , by contrast , makes up about 23 % of the universe 's ordinary matter -- nearly all the ordinary matter that is not hydrogen .
