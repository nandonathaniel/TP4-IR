Following World War II , the turnpike was extended east to Valley Forge in 1950 and west to the Ohio border in 1951 . In 1954 , the road was extended further east to the Delaware River . The mainline turnpike was finished in 1956 with the completion of the Delaware River Bridge . During the 1960s an additional tube was bored at four of the two - lane tunnels , while the other three tunnels were bypassed ; these improvements made the entire length of the highway four lanes wide . Improvements continue to be made to the road : rebuilding the original section to modern standards , widening portions of the turnpike to six lanes , and adding interchanges .
