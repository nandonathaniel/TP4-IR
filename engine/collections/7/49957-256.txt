It is considered rude to `` late bet '' , or make wagers while the dice are no longer in the middle of the table . While entirely permissible , excessive late betting will generally garner a warning as it slows play . At the discretion of the boxman or a `` pit boss '' , dealers can disallow a bet made after the dice have left the center .
