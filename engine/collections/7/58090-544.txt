Some argue that questioning on overall life status leads humans to overweight income concerns , rather than happiness . For instance Colombia came 37th in the 2018 World Happiness Index but 1st by daily emotional experience . In 2012 `` A Gallup survey on happiest countries had a completely different list ( compared with the World Happiness Index ) , with Panama first , followed by Paraguay , El Salvador , and Venezuela '' . Similarly a Pew survey of 43 countries in 2014 ( which excluded most of Europe ) had Mexico , Israel and Venezuela finishing first , second and third .
