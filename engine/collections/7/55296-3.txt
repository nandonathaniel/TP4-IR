Roman dates were counted inclusively forward to the next of three principal days : the first of the month ( the kalends ) , a day less than the middle of the month ( the ides ) , and eight days -- nine , counting inclusively -- before this ( the nones ) . The original calendar consisted of 10 months beginning in spring with March ; winter was left as an unassigned span of days . These months ran for 38 nundinal cycles , each forming a kind of eight ( i.e. , `` nine '' ) day week ended by religious rituals and a public market . The winter period was then used to create January and February . The legendary early kings Romulus and Numa were traditionally credited with establishing this early fixed calendar , which bears traces of its origin as an observational lunar one . In particular , the kalends , nones , and ides seem to have derived from the first sighting of the crescent moon , the first - quarter moon , and the full moon respectively . The system ran well short of the solar year , and it needed constant intercalation to keep religious festivals and other activities in their proper seasons . For superstitious reasons , such intercalation occurred within the month of February even after it was no longer considered the last month .
