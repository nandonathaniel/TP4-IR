In the United States , the Hellenic polytheist organization Hellenion also identifies its practices as `` Hellenic Pagan Reconstructionism '' and emphasizes historical accuracy in its mission statement . The group uses the term `` Hellenismos '' ( Ἑλληνισμός , Hellēnismós ) to describe the religion . Hellenion does not provide official membership numbers to the public , but an unofficial estimate of 43 members can be determined for 2007 , though this number can only give the roughest approximation , as Hellenion offers hardship waivers to those who can not afford the typical membership fees . In early 2010 , the organization reported 1 demos ( fully chartered local congregation ) and 6 proto - demoi ( start - up congregations not fully chartered with less than 3 members ) established , which offer rituals and other events for members and frequently for the public as well . Two of the six proto - demoi can not be independently verified to exist . Hellenion offers legal clergy training , basic adult religious education classes , and other educational / training courses for its members .
