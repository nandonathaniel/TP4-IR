Radio waves are a type of electromagnetic radiation with wavelengths in the electromagnetic spectrum longer than infrared light . Radio waves have frequencies as high as 300 gigahertz ( GHz ) to as low as 30 hertz ( Hz ) . At 300 GHz , the corresponding wavelength is 1 mm , and at 30 Hz is 10,000 km . Like all other electromagnetic waves , radio waves travel at the speed of light . They are generated by electric charges undergoing acceleration , such as time varying electric currents . Naturally occurring radio waves are emitted by lightning and astronomical objects .
