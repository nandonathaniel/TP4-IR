Throughout the last half of the 1950s , the White Citizens ' Councils produced racist children 's books that taught that heaven ( in the Christian conception ) is segregated . The White Citizens ' Council in Mississippi prevented school integration until 1964 . As school desegregation increased in some parts of the South , in some communities the White Citizens ' Council sponsored `` council schools , '' private institutions set up for white children , as these were beyond the reach of the ruling on public schools . Many of these private `` segregation academies '' continue to operate today .
