`` Antony van Leeuwenhoek remains one of the most imperfectly understood figures in the origins of experimental biology . The popular view is that Leeuwenhoek worked in a manner that was essentially crude and undisciplined , using untried methods of investigation that were lacking in refinement and objectivity . He has often been designated as a ' dilettante . ' His microscopes , furthermore , have been described as primitive and doubt has been expressed over his ability to have made many of the observations attributed to him . Recent research shows these views to be erroneous .
