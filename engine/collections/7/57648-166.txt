Some of Guatemala 's main exports are fruits , vegetables , flowers , handicrafts , cloths and others . In the face of a rising demand for biofuels , the country is growing and exporting an increasing amount of raw materials for biofuel production , especially sugar cane and palm oil . Critics say that this development leads to higher prices of staple foods like corn , a major ingredient in the Guatemalan diet . As a consequence of the subsidization of US American corn , Guatemala imports nearly half of its corn from the United States that is using 40 percent of its crop harvest for biofuel production . The government is considering ways to legalize poppy and marijuana production , hoping to tax production and use tax revenues to fund drug prevention programs and other social projects .
