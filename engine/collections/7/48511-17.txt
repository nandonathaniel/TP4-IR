When the Communist International ( Comintern ) was dissolved in 1943 in order for the Soviet Union to maintain its alliance with the other Allies of World War II , a new musical piece was needed to replace `` The Internationale '' as the national anthem . A contest was held in mid to late 1943 for a new anthem to be selected , with more than 200 submitted entries . Alexandrov 's music was chosen by Stalin personally , who both praised and criticized the song . Once the song was selected , new lyrics had to be written . Stalin thought that the hymn to be short , and that it had to invoke the Red Army 's impending victory over the forces of Germany on the Eastern Front . The poets Sergey Mikhalkov and Gabriel El - Registan were selected to write new lyrics by Stalin 's staffers , and were called to Moscow . They were tasked with writing new lyrics which referenced not only the Great Patriotic War , but also `` a Country of Soviets '' . The first draft of the lyrics were completed overnight . Stalin had suggested more lyrics be made about himself , and so an extra line was added making reference to Stalin inspiring the people .
