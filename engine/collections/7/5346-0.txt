Within thermodynamics , a physical property is any property that is measurable , and whose value describes a state of a physical system . Some constants , such as the ideal gas constant , R , do not describe the state of a system , and so are not properties . On the other hand , some constants , such as K ( the freezing point depression constant , or cryoscopic constant ) , depend on the identity of a substance , and so may be considered to describe the state of a system , and so may be considered physical properties .
