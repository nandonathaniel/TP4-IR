In 1989 , a third model was brought out by Land Rover to be produced in parallel with the other two : the Land Rover Discovery . To avoid possible confusion , the 1991 model year Ninety and the One Ten were renamed the `` Defender 90 '' and `` Defender 110 '' . These carried front badges that said `` Defender '' , with a badge on the rear of the vehicle saying `` Defender 90 '' or `` Defender 110 '' . The most recent model , from 2007 -- 2016 , still featured the space above the radiator for the badge but was blank . Instead it had `` Land Rover '' spelled across the leading edge of the bonnet in raised individual letters , in keeping with the Discovery and Freelander . At the rear was a new style of ' `` Defender '' badge with an underlining `` swoosh '' . On these last models there are no badges defining the wheelbase model of the vehicle .
