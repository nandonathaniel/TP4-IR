The album contains four songs written or co-written by Jennings as well as four songs composed by country tunesmith Harlan Howard . In an uncharacteristic move , Atkins allowed Jennings to use members of his band the Waylors on the recording , something that would rarely be permitted again , much to Waylon 's annoyance . Atkins marketed Jennings to the folk - pop audience , calling the album Folk - Country , as folk music was experiencing a renaissance on college campuses throughout the country , but the majority of the songs were mostly country - pop . As Jennings recalled later , `` Folk - Country was Nashville 's scheme to snare some of the hootenanny folk audience , which was then starting to cross over to rock ... I did n't mind the label ; to me , folk music was the original country music , sung by folks , plain and simple . '' The album did contain one Jennings classic : the catchy , up - tempo `` Stop the World ( And Let Me Off ) , '' which was released as a single ( peaking at # 16 ) and would remain a part of Jennings ' live show for years .
