As with other iron alloys , around 3 kg ( 6.5 lb ) metspar is added to each metric ton of steel ; the fluoride ions lower its melting point and viscosity . Alongside its role as an additive in materials like enamels and welding rod coats , most acidspar is reacted with sulfuric acid to form hydrofluoric acid , which is used in steel pickling , glass etching and alkane cracking . One - third of HF goes into synthesizing cryolite and aluminium trifluoride , both fluxes in the Hall -- HÃ©roult process for aluminium extraction ; replenishment is necessitated by their occasional reactions with the smelting apparatus . Each metric ton of aluminium requires about 23 kg ( 51 lb ) of flux . Fluorosilicates consume the second largest portion , with sodium fluorosilicate used in water fluoridation and laundry effluent treatment , and as an intermediate en route to cryolite and silicon tetrafluoride . Other important inorganic fluorides include those of cobalt , nickel , and ammonium .
