In both codes of rugby football ( rugby union and rugby league ) a hat - trick is when a player scores three or more tries in a game . In rugby union , a related concept is that of a `` full house '' ( scoring a try , conversion , penalty goal , and drop goal ) in a single game . When a player scored two tries , this is often referred to as a brace . As with association football , it is common to award the match ball to a player who scores a hat - trick .
