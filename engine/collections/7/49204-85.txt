In March 1875 , Bell and Pollok visited the famous scientist Joseph Henry , who was then director of the Smithsonian Institution , and asked Henry 's advice on the electrical multi-reed apparatus that Bell hoped would transmit the human voice by telegraph . Henry replied that Bell had `` the germ of a great invention '' . When Bell said that he did not have the necessary knowledge , Henry replied , `` Get it ! '' That declaration greatly encouraged Bell to keep trying , even though he did not have the equipment needed to continue his experiments , nor the ability to create a working model of his ideas . However , a chance meeting in 1874 between Bell and Thomas A. Watson , an experienced electrical designer and mechanic at the electrical machine shop of Charles Williams , changed all that .
