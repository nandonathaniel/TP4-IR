The earliest extant recording of `` Howl '' was thought to date from March 18 , 1956 . ( The Blackburn Collection recordings show otherwise ) . Ginsberg and Snyder , after hitch - hiking from San Francisco , read from their poems in the Anna Mann dormitory at Reed College , Snyder 's alma mater . This recording , discovered in mid-2007 on a reel - to - reel tape in the Reed College archives , contains only Part I of `` Howl '' . After beginning to read Part II , Ginsberg said to the audience , `` I do n't really feel like reading anymore . I just sorta have n't got any kind of steam . ''
