Though the notion of the cosine was not yet developed in his time , Euclid 's Elements , dating back to the 3rd century BC , contains an early geometric theorem almost equivalent to the law of cosines . The cases of obtuse triangles and acute triangles ( corresponding to the two cases of negative or positive cosine ) are treated separately , in Propositions 12 and 13 of Book 2 . Trigonometric functions and algebra ( in particular negative numbers ) being absent in Euclid 's time , the statement has a more geometric flavor :
