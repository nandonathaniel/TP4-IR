`` The robustness , completeness , and thoroughness of the framing effort '' . Snow and Benford ( 1988 ) identify three core framing - tasks , and state that the degree to which framers attend to these tasks will determine participant mobilization . They characterize the three tasks as the following : diagnostic framing for the identification of a problem and assignment of blame prognostic framing to suggest solutions , strategies , and tactics to a problem motivational framing that serves as a call to arms or rationale for action The relationship between the proposed frame and the larger belief - system ; centrality : the frame can not be of low hierarchical significance and salience within the larger belief system . Its range and interrelatedness , if the framer links the frame to only one core belief or value that , in itself , has a limited range within the larger belief system , the frame has a high degree of being discounted . Relevance of the frame to the realities of the participants ; a frame must seem relevant to participants and must also inform them . Empirical credibility or testability can constrain relevancy : it relates to participant experience , and has narrative fidelity , meaning that it fits in with existing cultural myths and narrations . Cycles of protest ( Tarrow 1983a ; 1983b ) ; the point at which the frame emerges on the timeline of the current era and existing preoccupations with social change . Previous frames may affect efforts to impose a new frame .
