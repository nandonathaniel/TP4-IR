Voting rights of United States citizens in Puerto Rico , like the voting rights of residents of other United States territories , differ from those of United States citizens in each of the fifty states and the District of Columbia . Residents of Puerto Rico and other U.S. territories do not have voting representation in the United States Congress , and are not entitled to electoral votes for President . The United States Constitution grants congressional voting representation to U.S. states , which Puerto Rico and other U.S. territories are not , specifying that members of Congress shall be elected by direct popular vote and that the President and the Vice President shall be elected by electors chosen by the States .
