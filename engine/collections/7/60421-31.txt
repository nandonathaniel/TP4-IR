Benaderet 's treatment was successful and concluded in January 1968 . She missed ten episodes of the show as she recuperated , while her fan mail increased as she received many get - well wishes . Her character of Kate Bradley was described in the storyline as being out of town caring for an unseen ill relative , as expectations were that Benaderet would eventually recover and be able to resume filming . Rosemary DeCamp ( Kate 's sister Helen ) and Shirley Mitchell ( Kate 's cousin Mae Jennings ) filled in as temporary mother figures during her absence ; Mitchell had previously worked with Benaderet on The Jack Benny Program in 1954 - 55 as Mabel Flapsaddle . Benaderet returned for the March 30 fifth - season finale `` Kate 's Homecoming '' , but after shooting the first three episodes of the sixth season , she took leave from the series in August 1968 due to fatigue . Initial plans were for her to record her voice to be inserted into future episodes . However , her condition declined and on September 26 , chest pains related to her illness forced her to return to the hospital for the final time . The fourth show of the sixth season , `` The Valley Has a Baby '' , marked Benaderet 's last episode and featured only her voice with her stand - in filmed from the rear .
