Moltke 's plan was that the three armies , while advancing , should make a right wheel , so that the first army on the right would reach the bank of the Moselle opposite Metz , while the second and third armies should push forward , the third army to defeat the French force near Strasbourg , and the second to strike the Moselle near Pont - à - Mousson . If the French army should be found in front of the second army , it would be attacked in front by the second army and in flank by the first or the third ( or both ) . If it should be found on or north of the line from Saarburg to Lunéville , it could still be attacked from two sides by the second and third armies in co-operation . The intention of the great right wheel was to attack the principal French army in such a direction as to drive it north and cut its communications with Paris . The fortress of Metz was to be only monitored , and the main German forces , after defeating the chief French army , would then march against Paris .
