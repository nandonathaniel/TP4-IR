At the end of World War I , German citizens felt that their country had been humiliated as a result of the Treaty of Versailles , which included a war guilt clause and forced Germany to pay enormous reparations payments and forfeit territories formerly controlled by German Empire and all its colonies . The pressure of the reparations on the German economy led to hyperinflation during the early 1920s . In 1923 the French occupied the Ruhr region when Germany defaulted on its reparations payments . Although Germany began to improve economically in the mid-1920s , the Great Depression created more economic hardship and a rise in political forces that advocated radical solutions to Germany 's woes . The Nazis , under Hitler , promoted the nationalist stab - in - the - back legend stating that Germany had been betrayed by Jews and Communists . The party promised to rebuild Germany as a major power and create a Greater Germany that would include Alsace - Lorraine , Austria , Sudetenland , and other German - populated territories in Europe . The Nazis also aimed to occupy and colonize non-German territories in Poland , the Baltic states , and the Soviet Union , as part of the Nazi policy of seeking Lebensraum ( `` living space '' ) in eastern Europe .
