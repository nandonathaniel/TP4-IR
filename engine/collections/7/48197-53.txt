It has been said that Southerners are most easily distinguished from other Americans by their speech , both in terms of accent and idiom . However , there is no single `` Southern Accent . '' Rather , Southern American English is a collection of dialects of the English spoken throughout the South . Southern American English can be divided into different sub-dialects , with speech differing between , for example , that of Appalachian region and the coastal `` low country '' around Charleston , South Carolina . Folklorists in the 1920s and later argued that because of the region 's isolation , Appalachian language patterns more closely mirrored Elizabethan English than other accents in the United States . The dialect spoken to various degrees by many African Americans , African American Vernacular English ( AAVE ) , shares many similarities with Southern dialect , unsurprising given that group 's strong historical ties to the South .
