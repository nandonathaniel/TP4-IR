There are two pathways of electron transfer . In cyclic electron transfer , electrons are removed from an excited chlorophyll molecule , passed through an electron transport chain to a proton pump , and then returned to the chlorophyll . The mobile electron carriers are , as usual , a lipid - soluble quinone and a water - soluble cytochrome . The resulting proton gradient is used to make ATP .
