Lord Stanley 's five sons were instrumental in bringing ice hockey to Europe , defeating a court team ( which included the future Edward VII and George V ) at Buckingham Palace in 1895 . By 1903 , a five - team league had been founded . The Ligue Internationale de Hockey sur Glace was founded in 1908 to govern international competition , and the first European championship was won by Great Britain in 1910 . The sport grew further in Europe in the 1920s , after ice hockey became an Olympic sport . Many bandy players switched to hockey so as to be able to compete in the Olympics . Bandy remained popular in the Soviet Union , which only started its ice hockey program in the 1950s . In the mid-20th century , the Ligue became the International Ice Hockey Federation .
