Gould explained Hutton 's view of uniformity of rate ; mountain ranges or grand canyons are built by accumulation of nearly insensible changes added up through vast time . Some major events such as floods , earthquakes , and eruptions , do occur . But these catastrophes are strictly local . They neither occurred in the past , nor shall happen in the future , at any greater frequency or extent than they display at present . In particular , the whole earth is never convulsed at once .
