In a number of places where there is geothermal activity , wells have been drilled and fitted with impermeable casements that allow them to erupt like geysers . The vents of such geysers are artificial , but are tapped into natural hydrothermal systems . These so - called artificial geysers , technically known as erupting geothermal wells , are not true geysers . Little Old Faithful Geyser , in Calistoga , California , is an example . The geyser erupts from the casing of a well drilled in the late 19th century . According to Dr. John Rinehart in his book A Guide to Geyser Gazing ( 1976 p. 49 ) , a man had drilled into the geyser in search for water . He had `` simply opened up a dead geyser '' .
