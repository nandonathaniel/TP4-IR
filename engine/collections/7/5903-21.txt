Constant length : In other cases , transform faults will remain at a constant length . This steadiness can be attributed to many different causes . In the case of ridge - to - ridge transforms , the constancy is caused by the continuous growth by both ridges outward , canceling any change in length . The opposite occurs when a ridge linked to a subducting plate , where all the lithosphere ( new sea floor ) being created by the ridge is subducted , or swallowed up , by the subduction zone . Finally , when two upper subduction plates are linked there is no change in length . This is due to the plates moving parallel with each other and no new lithosphere is being created to change that length .
