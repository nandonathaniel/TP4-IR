By this point Frederick was increasingly concerned by the Russian advance from the east and marched to counter it . Just east of the Oder in Brandenburg - Neumark , at the Battle of Zorndorf ( now Sarbinowo , Poland ) , a Prussian army of 35,000 men under Frederick on 25 August 1758 , fought a Russian army of 43,000 commanded by Count William Fermor . Both sides suffered heavy casualties -- the Prussians 12,800 , the Russians 18,000 -- but the Russians withdrew , and Frederick claimed victory . The American historian Daniel Marston described Zorndorf as a `` draw '' as both sides were too exhausted and had taken such losses that neither wished to fight another battle with the other . In the undecided Battle of Tornow on 25 September , a Swedish army repulsed six assaults by a Prussian army but did not push on Berlin following the Battle of Fehrbellin .
