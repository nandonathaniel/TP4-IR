The institutions that are responsible for local government within states are typically town , city , or county boards , water management districts , fire management districts , library districts and other similar governmental units which make laws that affect their particular area . These laws concern issues such as traffic , the sale of alcohol and the keeping of animals . The highest elected official of a town or city is usually the mayor . In New England , towns operate in a direct democratic fashion , and in some states , such as Rhode Island , Connecticut , and some parts of Massachusetts , counties have little or no power , existing only as geographic distinctions . In other areas , county governments have more power , such as to collect taxes and maintain law enforcement agencies .
