The oil and gas industry is usually divided into three major sectors : upstream ( or exploration and production - E&P ) , midstream and downstream . The upstream sector includes searching for potential underground or underwater crude oil and natural gas fields , drilling exploratory wells , and subsequently drilling and operating the wells that recover and bring the crude oil or raw natural gas to the surface . There has been a significant shift toward including unconventional gas as a part of the upstream sector , and corresponding developments in liquefied natural gas ( LNG ) processing and transport .
