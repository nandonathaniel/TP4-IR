In the United Kingdom , Ireland , Australia and New Zealand , immediately after `` Happy Birthday '' has been sung , it is traditional for one of the guests to enthusiastically lead with `` Hip hip ... '' and then for all of the other guests to join in and say `` ... hooray ! '' This is normally repeated three times . In Canada , especially at young children 's birthdays , immediately after `` Happy Birthday '' has been sung , the singers segue into `` How old are you now ? How old are you now ? How old are you now - ow , how old are you now ? '' and then count up : `` Are you one ? Are you two ? Are you ... '' until they reach the right age , at which the celebrant says `` yes '' , and everybody else , who presumably knows the right number , cheers .
