Of the original GATT members , Syria and the SFR Yugoslavia have not rejoined the WTO . Since FR Yugoslavia , ( renamed as Serbia and Montenegro and with membership negotiations later split in two ) , is not recognised as a direct SFRY successor state ; therefore , its application is considered a new ( non-GATT ) one . The General Council of WTO , on 4 May 2010 , agreed to establish a working party to examine the request of Syria for WTO membership . The contracting parties who founded the WTO ended official agreement of the `` GATT 1947 '' terms on 31 December 1995 . Montenegro became a member in 2012 , while Serbia is in the decision stage of the negotiations and is expected to become a member of the WTO in the future .
