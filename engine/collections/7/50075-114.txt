The period starting from the end of the last ice age , 10,000 years ago , to around 6,000 years ago was characterized by rising sea levels and a need to adapt to a changing environment and find new food sources . The development of Mode 5 ( microlith ) tools began in response to these changes . They were derived from the previous Paleolithic tools , hence the term Epipaleolithic , or were intermediate between the Paleolithic and the Neolithic , hence the term Mesolithic ( Middle Stone Age ) . The choice of a word depends on exact circumstances and the inclination of the archaeologists excavating the site . Microliths were used in the manufacture of more efficient composite tools , resulting in an intensification of hunting and fishing and with increasing social activity the development of more complex settlements , such as Lepenski Vir . Domestication of the dog as a hunting companion probably dates to this period .
