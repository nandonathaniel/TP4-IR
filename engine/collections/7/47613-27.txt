After the fall of the Roman Empire , the focus of alchemical development moved to the Islamic World . Much more is known about Islamic alchemy because it was better documented : indeed , most of the earlier writings that have come down through the years were preserved as Arabic translations . The word alchemy itself was derived from the Arabic word al - kīmiyā ' ( الكيمياء ) . The early Islamic world was a melting pot for alchemy . Platonic and Aristotelian thought , which had already been somewhat appropriated into hermetical science , continued to be assimilated during the late 7th and early 8th centuries through Syriac translations and scholarship .
