Mass -- energy equivalence also holds in macroscopic systems . For example , if one takes exactly one kilogram of ice , and applies heat , the mass of the resulting melt - water will be more than a kilogram : it will include the mass from the thermal energy ( latent heat ) used to melt the ice ; this follows from the conservation of energy . This number is small but not negligible : about 3.7 nanograms . It is given by the latent heat of melting ice ( 334 kJ / kg ) divided by the speed of light squared ( c = 9 Ã— 10 m / s ) .
