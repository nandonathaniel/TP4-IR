Spouses can choose each other even long before they are married , thus becoming betrothed . The betrothal is subject to parental approval unless the parties are of age and intend to marry soon , at which point the betrothal is announced . They exchange rings and the betrothal lasts at least a year , and is revocable by the return of the rings ; however , it is rarely broken . After their formal betrothal , the couple appoint a date , at least a year later , for the wedding .
