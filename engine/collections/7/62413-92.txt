October 4 , 1986 -- CBS News anchorman Dan Rather is assaulted while walking along Park Avenue by two men , one of whom Rather reported kept asking him `` Kenneth , what is the frequency ? '' as he did . The mysterious question became a pop - culture catch phrase and inspired an R.E.M. song , which Rather joined the band with in performing on Late Night with David Letterman A man named William Tager , who apparently believed that Rather was secretly broadcasting messages to him , was identified as one of the assailants in 1997 ( though not charged because the statute of limitations had expired ) following his own conviction for killing an NBC stagehand .
