The British and French estimated that Poland would be able to defend itself for two to three months , while Poland estimated it could do so for at least six months . While Poland drafted its estimates based upon the expectation that the Western Allies would honor their treaty obligations and quickly start an offensive of their own , the French and British expected the war to develop into trench warfare much like World War I . The Polish government was not notified of this strategy and based all of its defence plans on promises of quick relief by their Western allies .
