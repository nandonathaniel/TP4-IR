where p is called `` total pressure '' , and q is `` dynamic pressure '' . Many authors refer to the pressure p as static pressure to distinguish it from total pressure p and dynamic pressure q . In Aerodynamics , L.J. Clancy writes : `` To distinguish it from the total and dynamic pressures , the actual pressure of the fluid , which is associated not with its motion but with its state , is often referred to as the static pressure , but where the term pressure alone is used it refers to this static pressure .
