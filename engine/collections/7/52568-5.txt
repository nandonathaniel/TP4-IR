Underage individuals who are employees of businesses that hold a valid state - issued liquor license may possess ( but not consume ) alcohol in the course of their job during regular business hours . Common examples are serving alcoholic drinks to customers of a restaurant , making deliveries for a catering company , and stocking shelves at a store that sells alcohol . Alcohol may be possessed or consumed by an underage person in a private residence so long as it is furnished or allowed by a member of that person 's immediate family ( typically a parent ) . Alcohol may be consumed as part of a religious ceremony , such as the Roman Catholic or Episcopal Communion rite .
