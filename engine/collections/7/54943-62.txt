A phenomenon known as quantum walk increases the efficiency of the energy transport of light significantly . In the photosynthetic cell of an algae , bacterium , or plant , there are light - sensitive molecules called chromophores arranged in an antenna - shaped structure named a photocomplex . When a photon is absorbed by a chromophore , it is converted into a quasiparticle referred to as an exciton , which jumps from chromophore to chromophore towards the reaction center of the photocomplex , a collection of molecules that traps its energy in a chemical form that makes it accessible for the cell 's metabolism . The exciton 's wave properties enable it to cover a wider area and try out several possible paths simultaneously , allowing it to instantaneously `` choose '' the most efficient route , where it will have the highest probability of arriving at its destination in the minimum possible time . Because that quantum walking takes place at temperatures far higher than quantum phenomena usually occur , it is only possible over very short distances , due to obstacles in the form of destructive interference that come into play . These obstacles cause the particle to lose its wave properties for an instant before it regains them once again after it is freed from its locked position through a classic `` hop '' . The movement of the electron towards the photo center is therefore covered in a series of conventional hops and quantum walks .
