Centered on the Tigris in Upper Mesopotamia ( modern northern Iraq , northeastern Syria , southeastern Turkey and the northwestern fringes of Iran ) , the Assyrians came to rule powerful empires at several times . Making up a substantial part of the greater Mesopotamian `` cradle of civilization '' , which included Sumer , the Akkadian Empire , and Babylonia , Assyria was at the height of technological , scientific and cultural achievements for its time . At its peak , the Assyrian empire stretched from Cyprus and the East Mediterranean to Iran , and from what is now Armenia and Azerbaijan in the Caucasus , to the Arabian Peninsula , Egypt and eastern Libya .
