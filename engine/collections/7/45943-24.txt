Nothing I have read ... has brought home the overwhelming human sense of history that this song does . The only thing I can relate it to at all is The Red Badge of Courage . It 's a remarkable song , the rhythmic structure , the voice of Levon and the bass line with the drum accents and then the heavy close harmony of Levon , Richard and Rick in the theme , make it seem impossible that this is n't some traditional material handed down from father to son straight from that winter of 1865 to today . It has that ring of truth and the whole aura of authenticity .
