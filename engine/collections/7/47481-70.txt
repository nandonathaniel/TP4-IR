Meade began by ordering Sheridan 's Cavalry Corps to clear the Brock Road for the infantry , but the troopers soon bogged down . The brigade of Col. J. Irvin Gregg ( David Gregg 's division ) , was stopped at Corbin 's Bridge on the Catharpin Road by cavalrymen under Wade Hampton and Rooney Lee . Gregg 's men withdrew to a field west of Todd 's Tavern , constructed rudimentary earthworks , and repulsed a series of Confederate attacks . Wesley Merritt 's Union division encountered Fitzhugh Lee 's cavalry behind barricades on the Brock Road about a mile south of Todd 's Tavern. Sharp fighting resulted in the late afternoon , and by nightfall , Sheridan decided against continuing in the dark and ordered his men to bivouac at Todd 's Tavern . The first Union infantry began moving at 8 p.m. and their advance was plagued by traffic jams . When Meade reached Todd 's Tavern after midnight he was infuriated to see Sheridan 's sleeping cavalrymen and ordered them to resume their road clearing operation .
