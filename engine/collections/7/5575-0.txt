The Fn key , short form for function , is a modifier key on many keyboards , especially on laptops , used in a compact layout to combine keys which are usually kept separate . It is typically found on laptops due to their keyboard size restrictions . It is also found on many full - sized `` multimedia '' keyboards as the F - Lock key . It is mainly for the purpose of changing display or audio settings quickly , such as brightness , contrast , or volume , and is held down in conjunction with the appropriate key to change the settings .
