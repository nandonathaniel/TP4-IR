In 2010 , Reeves indicated that Matheson and Solomon were working on a script for a third film , confirming in April 2011 that a draft was complete . Winter said in March 2012 that he and Reeves both like the finished script , which revisits the two characters after the changes of the past twenty years . Despite the script being finished and satisfied by both parties , no specific filming dates have been named . In April 2016 , Winter said that he hoped the film would begin production in 2017 . Reeves gave an update on the film in February 2017 and said a story has been written for the third film . `` Basically , they 're supposed to write a song to save the world and they have n't done that . The pressure of having to save the world , their marriages are falling apart , their kids are kind of mad at them , and then someone comes from the future and tells them if they do n't write the song it 's not just the world , it 's the universe . So they have to save the universe because time is breaking apart . '' On May 8 , 2018 , The Hollywood Reporter confirmed that a third film , Bill & Ted : Face the Music , was officially in pre-production with Dean Parisot directing . No release date has been announced yet .
