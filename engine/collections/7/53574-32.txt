The allegory which is here contrived by the advocates of free will is too absurd to deserve refutation . According to them , under the figure of a wounded man is described the condition of Adam after the fall ; from which they infer that the power of acting well was not wholly extinguished in him ; because he is said to be only half - dead . As if it had been the design of Christ , in this passage , to speak of the corruption of human nature , and to inquire whether the wound which Satan inflicted on Adam were deadly or curable ; nay , as if he had not plainly , and without a figure , declared in another passage , that all are dead , but those whom he quickens by his voice ( John 5 : 25 ) . As little plausibility belongs to another allegory , which , however , has been so highly satisfactory , that it has been admitted by almost universal consent , as if it had been a revelation from heaven . This Samaritan they imagine to be Christ , because he is our guardian ; and they tell us that wine was poured , along with oil , into the wound , because Christ cures us by repentance and by a promise of grace . They have contrived a third subtlety , that Christ does not immediately restore health , but sends us to the Church , as an innkeeper , to be gradually cured . I acknowledge that I have no liking for any of these interpretations ; but we ought to have a deeper reverence for Scripture than to reckon ourselves at liberty to disguise its natural meaning . And , indeed , any one may see that the curiosity of certain men has led them to contrive these speculations , contrary to the intention of Christ .
