The replication fork is a structure that forms within the nucleus during DNA replication . It is created by helicases , which break the hydrogen bonds holding the two DNA strands together . The resulting structure has two branching `` prongs '' , each one made up of a single strand of DNA . These two strands serve as the template for the leading and lagging strands , which will be created as DNA polymerase matches complementary nucleotides to the templates ; the templates may be properly referred to as the leading strand template and the lagging strand template .
