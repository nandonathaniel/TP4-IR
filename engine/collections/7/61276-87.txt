A three - axis accelerometer will output zero ‚Äê g on all three axes if it is dropped or otherwise put into a ballistic trajectory ( also known as an inertial trajectory ) , so that it experiences `` free fall , '' as do astronauts in orbit ( astronauts experience small tidal accelerations called microgravity , which are neglected for the sake of discussion here ) . Some amusement park rides can provide several seconds at near - zero g . Riding NASA 's `` Vomit Comet '' provides near - zero g for about 25 seconds at a time .
