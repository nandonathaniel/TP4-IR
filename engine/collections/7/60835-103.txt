Britain , France , and Austria opposed the Treaty of San Stefano because it gave Russia too much influence in the Balkans , where insurrections were frequent . War threatened . After numerous attempts a grand diplomatic settlement was reached at the Congress of Berlin ( June -- July 1878 ) . The new Treaty of Berlin revised the earlier treaty . Germany 's Otto von Bismarck ( 1815 -- 98 ) presided over the congress and brokered the compromises . One result was that Austria took control of the provinces of Bosnia and Herzegovina , intending to eventually merge them into the Austro - Hungarian Empire . Bosnia was eventually annexed by Austria - Hungary in 1908 . Bosnian Serbs assassinated Austria 's heir presumptive , Franz Ferdinand , in 1914 and the result was the First World War .
