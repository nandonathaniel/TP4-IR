Quartz arenites are sandstones that contain more than 90 % of siliceous grains . Grains can include quartz or chert rock fragments . Quartz arenites are texturally mature to supermature sandstones . These pure quartz sands result from extensive weathering that occurred before and during transport . This weathering removed everything but quartz grains , the most stable mineral . They are commonly affiliated with rocks that are deposited in a stable cratonic environment , such as aeolian beaches or shelf environments . Quartz arenites emanate from multiple recycling of quarts grains , generally as sedimentary source rocks and less regularly as first - cycle deposits derived from primary igneous or metamorphic rocks .
