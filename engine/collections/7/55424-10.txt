In the Southeast , Andrew Jackson 's destruction of Britain 's allies , the Creek Indians at the Battle of Horseshoe Bend in 1814 , ended the threat of Native American hostilities in that region . It opened vast areas in Georgia and Alabama for settlement as plantations and farmlands . The U.S. occupied all of West Florida during the war and in 1819 purchased the rest of Florida from Spain , thus preventing the Spanish from arming hostile tribes there . Creek Indians who escaped to Spanish Florida joined the Seminoles there , and put up a long resistance known as the Seminole Wars .
