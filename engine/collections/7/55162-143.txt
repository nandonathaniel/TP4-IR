Since their first championship in 1923 , the New York Yankees have won two or more World Series titles in every decade except the 1980s , when they won none . Additionally , they have won at least one American League pennant in every decade since the 1920s . ( They have yet to win a pennant or Series in the 2010s . ) The Yankees are the only team in either League to win more than three series in a row , winning in four consecutive seasons from 1936 to 1939 , and a still MLB record five consecutive seasons from 1949 to 1953 . The New York Giants ' four World Series appearances from 1921 to 1924 are the most consecutive appearances for any National League franchise . The Yankees are the only American League franchise to appear in four or more consecutive World Series . The 1907 -- 1908 Cubs , 1921 -- 1922 Giants and the 1975 -- 1976 Reds are the only National League teams to win back - to - back World Series . The 1907 -- 1909 Detroit Tigers and the 1911 -- 1913 New York Giants are the only teams to lose three consecutive World Series . The Chicago Cubs hold the record for the longest World Series championship drought of all time , with no titles between 1908 and 2016 ( 108 years ) . They also hold the longest ever pennant drought of all time , which stretched from 1945 to 2016 . Their pennant drought ended with a 4 -- 2 series victory over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the 2016 NLCS . With the Cubs ' subsequent victory in the 2016 World Series , the longest World Series championship drought belongs to the Cleveland Indians , who have not won a World Series since 1948 . The Indians ' drought is the second longest championship drought among all four major professional sports leagues in North America ( MLB , NBA , NFL , and NHL ) ; only the NFL 's Arizona Cardinals , who last won a league championship in 1947 , when the team still operated as the Chicago Cardinals , have a longer championship drought . The team with the longest active pennant drought among AL teams that have played in a World Series at least once is the Baltimore Orioles , who have not reached a World Series since winning their last title in 1983 . The team with the longest active pennant drought among NL teams that have played in a World Series at least once is the Pittsburgh Pirates , who have not reached a World Series since winning their last title in 1979 . This also means that the Pirates hold the second longest active World Series title drought among all teams that have at least one Series and longest championship drought among NL teams that have won a Series . Twenty - three of the 28 teams to play in the World Series have won it at least once . The only exceptions are : Milwaukee Brewers ( formerly Seattle Pilots , 1969 ) , San Diego Padres ( 1969 ) , Colorado Rockies ( 1993 ) , Tampa Bay Rays ( formerly Devil Rays , 1998 ) , and Texas Rangers ( formerly Washington Senators , 1961 ) . The Padres and Rangers have both lost two World Series ; the remaining teams have all lost their only Series appearance . As of the present , all teams with three or more World Series appearances have won the World Series at least once . Two teams have never played in the World Series : the National League 's Washington Nationals ( formerly Montreal Expos , established in 1969 ) , and the American League 's Seattle Mariners ( established in 1977 ) . Both franchises have participated in post-season play and competed in a League Championship Series at least once , but neither team has any League Championship Series victories . The Red Sox have the most World Series titles before their first World Series loss , winning the championship in their first five appearances -- 1903 , 1912 , 1915 , 1916 , and 1918 -- before losing in the next series they played , in 1946 . The only other teams who have more than one Series victory before their first Series loss are the Chicago White Sox ( in 1906 and 1917 ) , the Cleveland Indians ( in 1920 and 1948 ) , the Toronto Blue Jays ( in 1992 and 1993 ) , and the Miami Marlins ( in 1997 and 2003 as the Florida Marlins ) . The Blue Jays and the Marlins have never lost a World Series . The American League 's Toronto Blue Jays ( 1992 and 1993 ) and National League 's Miami Marlins ( 1997 and 2003 as the Florida Marlins ) hold the record for most appearances in a Series without ever losing a Series . Two other franchises have won their lone appearance : the National League 's Arizona Diamondbacks ( 2001 ) and American League 's Los Angeles Angels ( 2002 as the Anaheim Angels ) . The Pirates , Reds , Red Sox , and Giants are tied with the longest active streak of World Series victories ( three ) since the last time they lost a series . After losing the 1927 series to the Yankees , the Pirates have emerged victorious in the next three series in which they played ( 1960 , 1971 , and 1979 ) . The Reds last series loss prior to their current active streak of three titles ( 1975 , 1976 , and 1990 ) was in 1972 . The Red Sox are the American League leaders in this category with three consecutive titles ( 2004 , 2007 , and 2013 ) since their last series loss ( 1986 ) . The Giants lost in 2002 before winning the next three they appeared in ( 2010 , 2012 , and 2014 ) . The Yankees have the most World Series victories ( eight ) between World Series losses . After losing the 1926 World Series to the Cardinals , the Yankees won their next eight appearances in the series ( 1927 , 1928 , 1932 , 1936 , 1937 , 1938 , 1939 , and 1941 ) before losing in 1942 to the Cardinals again . After this loss , the Yankees went on to win their next seven Series appearances ( 1943 , 1947 , 1949 , 1950 , 1951 , 1952 , and 1953 ) before their next Series loss in 1955 to the Brooklyn Dodgers . The Cardinals are the National League leader in this category , with four titles ( 1944 , 1946 , 1964 , and 1967 ) between series losses in 1943 and 1968 . The Cubs and Dodgers are tied at seven apiece for most World Series losses between World Series victories . The Dodgers lost their first seven appearances in the Fall Classics ( 1916 , 1920 , 1941 , 1947 , 1949 , 1952 , and 1953 ) before winning their first title in 1955 . The Cubs ' situation was the opposite : between winning their last two titles ( in 1908 and 2016 ) , they lost the World Series in 1910 , 1918 , 1929 , 1932 , 1935 , 1938 , and 1945 . The Cleveland Indians have four World Series losses ( 1954 , 1995 , 1997 , and 2016 ) since their last crown in 1948 , more than any other team in the American League . The longest duration without repeat World Series champions is sixteen years , dating back to the 2000 New York Yankees . The previous record of fourteen years ( in between the 1978 New York Yankees ' win and the 1993 Toronto Blue Jays ' win ) was broken when the San Francisco Giants , who won the 2014 World Series , did not qualify for the postseason in 2015 . The longest sequence of World Series in which each Series was won by a different franchise is 10 , from 1978 ( Yankees ) through 1987 ( Minnesota Twins ) . This streak was broken when the Dodgers , which had won in 1981 , won in 1988 .
