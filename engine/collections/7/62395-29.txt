In 2000 , South Africa also `` downlisted '' its elephant population to CITES Appendix Two with a stated desire to sell its ivory stockpile . In the same year , CITES agreed to the establishment of two systems to inform its member states on the status of illegal killing and trade . The two systems , Monitoring the Illegal Killing of Elephants ( MIKE ) and Elephant Trade Information System ( ETIS ) , have been highly criticised as a waste of money for not being able to prove or disprove any causality between ivory stockpile sales and poaching levels -- perhaps the most significant reason for their establishment . They do pull together information on poaching and seizures as provided by member states , although not all states provide comprehensive data .
