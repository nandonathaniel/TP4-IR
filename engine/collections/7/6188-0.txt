The concept of the public trust relates back to the origins of democratic government and its seminal idea that within the public lies the true power and future of a society ; therefore , whatever trust the public places in its officials must be respected . One of the reasons that bribery is regarded as a notorious evil is that it contributes to a culture of political corruption in which the public trust is eroded . Other issues related to political corruption or betrayal of public trust are lobbying , special interest groups and the public cartel .
