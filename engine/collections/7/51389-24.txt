The Throgs Neck Bridge was designed by structural engineer Othmar Ammann , who also designed the George Washington , Bronx - Whitestone , Verrazzano - Narrows , and Triborough Bridges in New York City . It connects the boroughs of Queens to the south and the Bronx to the north , and is the third vehicular bridge to be constructed between Queens and the Bronx , after the Triborough and Bronx -- Whitestone Bridges . The bridge is a suspension bridge with six lanes , three in each direction . Each three - lane roadway is 37 feet ( 11 m ) wide , and the two directions of traffic are divided by a 4 - foot - wide ( 1.2 m ) barrier . The roadway is paved with asphalt . There is no pedestrian or bicyclist access of any kind . The Throgs Neck Bridge is a toll bridge ; it originally had tollbooths on the Bronx side , but these were replaced by electronic toll collection gantries in 2017 .
