While most executive agencies have a single director , administrator , or secretary appointed by the President of the United States , independent agencies ( in the narrower sense of being outside presidential control ) almost always have a commission , board , or similar collegial body consisting of five to seven members who share power over the agency . ( This is why many independent agencies include the word `` Commission '' or `` Board '' in their name . ) The president appoints the commissioners or board members , subject to Senate confirmation , but they often serve terms that are staggered and longer than a four - year presidential term , meaning that most presidents will not have the opportunity to appoint all the commissioners of a given independent agency . The president can normally designate which commissioner will serve as the chairperson . Normally there are statutory provisions limiting the president 's authority to remove commissioners , typically for incapacity , neglect of duty , malfeasance , or other good cause . In addition , most independent agencies have a statutory requirement of bipartisan membership on the commission , so the president can not simply fill vacancies with members of his own political party .
