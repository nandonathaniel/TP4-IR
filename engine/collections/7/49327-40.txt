The Nissan 4W70 Carrier was introduced in 1950 based on the Dodge M37 . The 4W70 used the M37 's chassis , but used the 4W60 Patrol drivetrain and engine . The grille was narrower and the front fenders changed . The 4W72 was introduced in 1955 ( the 4W71 designation was skipped ) with changes to the hood , grille and headlights . Power increased to 105 hp thanks to the new Nissan NC engine . Modifications again to the hood , fenders and grille and an increase in power to 145 hp led to the 4W73 , introduced in 1959 and powered by the Nissan P engine .
