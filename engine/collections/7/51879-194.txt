Shortly after the suspension of ChuoAoyama , PwC acted quickly to stem any possible client attrition as a result of the scandal . It set up the PricewaterhouseCoopers Aarata , and some of ChuoAoyama 's accountants ( but most of the international divisions ) moved to the new firm . ChuoAoyama resumed operations on 1 September 2006 under the Misuzu name . However , by this point the two firms combined had 30 % fewer clients than did ChuoAoyama prior to its suspension . Misuzu was dissolved in July 2007 .
