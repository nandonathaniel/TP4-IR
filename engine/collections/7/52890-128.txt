Mechanical collectors ( dust cyclones , multicyclones ) Electrostatic precipitators An electrostatic precipitator ( ESP ) , or electrostatic air cleaner is a particulate collection device that removes particles from a flowing gas ( such as air ) , using the force of an induced electrostatic charge . Electrostatic precipitators are highly efficient filtration devices that minimally impede the flow of gases through the device , and can easily remove fine particulates such as dust and smoke from the air stream . Baghouses Designed to handle heavy dust loads , a dust collector consists of a blower , dust filter , a filter - cleaning system , and a dust receptacle or dust removal system ( distinguished from air cleaners which utilize disposable filters to remove the dust ) . Particulate scrubbers Wet scrubber is a form of pollution control technology . The term describes a variety of devices that use pollutants from a furnace flue gas or from other gas streams . In a wet scrubber , the polluted gas stream is brought into contact with the scrubbing liquid , by spraying it with the liquid , by forcing it through a pool of liquid , or by some other contact method , so as to remove the pollutants .
