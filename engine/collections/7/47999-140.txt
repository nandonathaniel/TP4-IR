Sitcoms are traditionally the most widely syndicated reruns and are usually aired in a five - day - a-week strip ( standardly with two episode `` runs '' , separate sets of episodes of a particular program that are usually from different seasons , packaged for stations to air back - to - back or in different time slots ) , and in most cases , with additional weekend runs consisting of two ( or in some cases , four ) additional episodes . Marginally performing shows tend to last less than three to five years in broadcast syndication , sometimes moving to cable channels ( although rerun packages of some series are sold simultaneously into both broadcast syndication and cable , and sometimes to more than one cable network ) or into limited - run barter syndication ( such as through The Program Exchange ) after the end of their syndication runs , while more widely successful series can have a life in syndication that can run for decades ( I Love Lucy , the first series designed to be rerun , remains popular in syndication more than 60 years after its 1951 debut ) .
