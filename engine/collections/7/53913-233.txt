On October 9 , Syrian FROG - 7 surface - to - surface missiles struck the Israeli Air Force base of Ramat David , killing a pilot and injuring several soldiers . Additional missiles struck civilian settlements . In retaliation , seven Israeli F - 4 Phantoms flew into Syria and struck the Syrian General Staff Headquarters in Damascus . The jets struck from Lebanese airspace to avoid the heavily defended regions around the Golan Heights , attacking a Lebanese radar station along the way . The upper floors of the Syrian GHQ and the Air Force Command were badly damaged . A Soviet cultural center , a television station , and other nearby structures were also mistakenly hit . One Israeli Phantom was shot down . The strike prompted the Syrians to transfer air defense units from the Golan Heights to the home front , allowing the Israeli Air Force greater freedom of action .
