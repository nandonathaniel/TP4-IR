1960 -- Dusky v. United States , 362 U.S. 402 ( 1960 ) , was a landmark United States Supreme Court case in which the Court affirmed a defendant 's right to have a competency evaluation before proceeding to trial . This case set the current standard for adjudicative competence in the United States . Although the statutes addressing competency vary from state to state in the United States , the two elements outlined in the Dusky v. United States decision are held in common : The defendant must understand the charges against him or her and must have the ability to aid his or her attorney in his or her own defense , although see Felthous ( 2011 ) , who argues that many state statutes -- and the federal statute -- do not incorporate the rationality standard enunciated in Dusky ) .
