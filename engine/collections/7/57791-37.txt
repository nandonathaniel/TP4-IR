The pattern of the Primitive Methodist Camp Meeting was as a time of prayer and preaching from the Bible . In the first Camp Meeting , four separate `` preaching stations '' had been set up by the afternoon , each with an audience , while in between others spent the time praying . Their emphasis on the Bible is a clear distinction from the spiritualist strand of American camp meetings .
