Fine art digital inkjet printing is printing from a computer image file directly to an inkjet printer as a final output . It evolved from digital proofing technology from Kodak , 3M , and other major manufacturers , with artists and other printers trying to adapt these dedicated prepress proofing machines to fine - art printing . There was experimentation with many of these types of printers , the most notable being the IRIS printer , initially adapted to fine - art printing by programmer David Coons , and adopted for fine - art work by Graham Nash at his Nash Editions printing company in 1991 . Initially , these printers were limited to glossy papers , but the IRIS Graphics printer allowed the use of a variety of papers that included traditional and non-traditional media . The IRIS printer was the standard for fine art digital printmaking for many years , and is still in use today , but has been superseded by large - format printers from other manufacturers such as Epson and HP that use fade - resistant , archival inks ( pigment - based , as well as newer solvent - based inks ) , and archival substrates specifically designed for fine - art printing .
