Additionally , media coverage has been proven to have a profound impact on criminal sentencing . A study conducted found that the more media attention a criminal case is given , the greater the incentive for prosecutors and judges to pursue harsher sentences . This is directly linked to the enormous increase in media coverage of crime over the past two decades . While crime decreased by 8 % between 1992 and 2002 , news reports on crime increased by 800 % and the average prison sentence length increased by 2,000 % for all crimes . Less media coverage means a greater chance of a lighter sentence or that the defendant may avoid prison time entirely .
