The emperor was the ultimate authority in policy - and decision - making , but in the early Principate he was expected to be accessible to individuals from all walks of life , and to deal personally with official business and petitions . A bureaucracy formed around him only gradually . The Julio - Claudian emperors relied on an informal body of advisors that included not only senators and equestrians , but trusted slaves and freedmen . After Nero , the unofficial influence of the latter was regarded with suspicion , and the emperor 's council ( consilium ) became subject to official appointment for the sake of greater transparency . Though the senate took a lead in policy discussions until the end of the Antonine dynasty , equestrians played an increasingly important role in the consilium . The women of the emperor 's family often intervened directly in his decisions . Plotina exercised influence on both her husband Trajan and his successor Hadrian . Her influence was advertised by having her letters on official matters published , as a sign that the emperor was reasonable in his exercise of authority and listened to his people .
