By 1860 Delaware was integrated into the Northern economy , and slavery was rare except in the southern districts of the state ; less than 2 percent of the population was enslaved . Both houses of the state General Assembly rejected secession overwhelmingly ; the House of Representatives was unanimous . There was quiet sympathy for the Confederacy by some state leaders , but it was tempered by distance ; Delaware was bordered by Union territory . Historian John Munroe concluded that the average citizen of Delaware opposed secession and was `` strongly Unionist '' but hoped for a peaceful solution even if it meant Confederate independence .
