In January 1912 , the hulls and equipment of Titanic and Olympic had been insured through Lloyd 's of London . The total coverage was £ 1,000,000 ( £ 89,000,000 today ) per ship . The policy was to be `` free from all average '' under £ 150,000 , meaning that the insurers would only pay for damage in excess of that sum . The premium , negotiated by brokers Willis Faber & Company ( now Willis Group ) , was 15 s ( 75 p ) per £ 100 , or £ 7,500 ( £ 670,000 today ) for the term of one year . Lloyd 's paid the White Star Line the full sum owed to them within 30 days .
