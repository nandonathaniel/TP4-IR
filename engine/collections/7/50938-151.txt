The Greater Richmond area was named the third - best city for business by MarketWatch in September 2007 , ranking behind only the Minneapolis and Denver areas and just above Boston . The area is home to eight Fortune 500 companies : electric utility Dominion Resources ; CarMax ; Owens & Minor ; Genworth Financial ; WestRock Company ; Performance Food Group , Markel Corporation , and Altria Group . However , only Dominion Resources and WestRock Company are headquartered within the city of Richmond ; the others are located in the neighboring counties of Henrico and Hanover . In 2008 , Altria moved its corporate HQ from New York City to Henrico County , adding another Fortune 500 corporation to Richmond 's list . In February 2006 , MeadWestvaco announced that they would move from Stamford , Connecticut , to Richmond in 2008 with the help of the Greater Richmond Partnership , a regional economic development organization that also helped locate Aditya Birla Minacs , Amazon.com , and Honeywell International , to the region . In July 2015 , MeadWestvaco merged with Georgia - based Rock - Tenn Company creating WestRock Company .
