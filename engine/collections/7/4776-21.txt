Vol. 1 was a critical and commercial success , and revitalised the careers of Dylan , Orbison and Petty . As Harrison had intended , the album defied contemporary musical trends such as hip hop , acid house and synthesised pop ; author Alan Clayson likens its release to `` a Viking longship docking in a hovercraft terminal '' . The album produced two successful singles and went on to achieve triple - platinum certification for sales in the United States . It was nominated for several awards and won the 1990 Grammy Award for Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group . Liner notes on the album cover were written by Monty Python 's Michael Palin under a pseudonym . Palin 's essay was based on an idea by Derek Taylor , who wrote an extensive fictional history of the Wilburys family that otherwise went unused . Harrison planned a feature film about the band , to be produced by HandMade and directed by David Leland , but contractual problems ended the project .
