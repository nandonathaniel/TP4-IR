Switzerland has a tradition of direct democracy . For any change in the constitution , a referendum is mandatory ( mandatory referendum ) ; for any change in a law , a referendum can be requested ( optional referendum ) . In addition , the people may present a constitutional popular initiative to introduce amendments to the federal constitution . The people also assumes a role similar to the constitutional court , which does not exist , and thus acts as the guardian of the rule of law .
