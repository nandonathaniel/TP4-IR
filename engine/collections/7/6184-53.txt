There was one vice-presidential debate between Congresswoman Ferraro and Vice President George H.W. Bush . Held on October 11 , the result was proclaimed mostly even by the press and historians ; women voters tended to think Ferraro had won , while men , Bush . At it , Ferraro criticized Reagan 's initial refusal to support an extension to the Voting Rights Act . Her experience was questioned at the debate and she was asked how her three terms in Congress stacked up with Bush 's extensive government experience . To one Bush statement she said , `` Let me just say first of all , that I almost resent , Vice President Bush , your patronizing attitude that you have to teach me about foreign policy . '' She strongly defended her position on abortion , which earned her applause and a respectful reply from her opponent . In the days leading up to the debate , Second Lady of the United States Barbara Bush had publicly referred to Ferraro as `` that four - million - dollar -- I ca n't say it , but it rhymes with ' rich ' . '' Barbara Bush soon apologized , saying she had not meant to infer Ferraro was `` a witch '' . Peter Teeley , Vice President Bush 's press secretary , had dispensed with rhymes as he said of Ferraro just prior to the debate , `` She 's too bitchy . She 's very arrogant . Humility is n't one of her strong points and I think that comes through . '' Teeley declined to apologize for the remark , saying it had no sexist implications and the Ferraro campaign was being `` hypersensitive '' in complaining about it .
