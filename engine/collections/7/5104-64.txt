Stuart Craig , set designer for all of the previous Harry Potter films , returned for the final two parts . He said , `` We made a very different kind of film , which was shot a great deal on location . We travelled quite far , we built sets , and they spend a lot of time in a forest , '' he explained . `` We built forest sets and integrated them into the real forests , so there were challenges there , as you might imagine . '' Craig was ultimately nominated for an Academy Award for his work on Part 1 .
