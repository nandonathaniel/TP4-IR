In a large - scale screening study , one in ten children in mainstream classrooms were identified with working memory deficits . The majority of them performed very poorly in academic achievements , independent of their IQ . Similarly , working memory deficits have been identified in national curriculum low - achievers as young as seven years of age . Without appropriate intervention , these children lag behind their peers . A recent study of 37 school - age children with significant learning disabilities has shown that working memory capacity at baseline measurement , but not IQ , predicts learning outcomes two years later . This suggests that working memory impairments are associated with low learning outcomes and constitute a high risk factor for educational underachievement for children . In children with learning disabilities such as dyslexia , ADHD , and developmental coordination disorder , a similar pattern is evident .
