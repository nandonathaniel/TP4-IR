The Dutch first began to ply the island 's ponds for salt in the 1620s . Despite the Dutch presence on the island , the Spaniards recaptured St. Martin in 1633 . One year later , they built a fort ( now Fort Amsterdam , near Philipsburg ) and another artillery battery at Pointe Blanche to assert their claim and control access to Great Bay salt pond . A massive influx of African slaves took place in the 18th century with the development of sugarcane plantations by the French and Dutch . Slavery was abolished in the first half of the 19th century . On some of their territories the British imported Chinese and South Asians to take the place of slaves . Thus , St. Martin and the other islands are populated by a mixture of Amerindian , European , African , Indian and Asian peoples .
