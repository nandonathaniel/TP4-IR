Flowers are also pollinated by birds and must be large and colorful to be visible against natural scenery . Such bird -- pollinated native plants include : Kōwhai ( Sophora species ) , flax ( Phormium tenax , harakeke ) and kākā beak ( Clianthus puniceus , kōwhai ngutu - kākā ) . Interestingly enough , flowers adapt the mechanism on their petals to change colour in acting as a communicative mechanism for the bird to visit . An example is the tree fuchsia ( Fuchsia excorticata , kōtukutuku ) which are green when needing to be pollinated and turn red for the birds to stop coming and pollinating the flower .
