Most of the stars occupy the region in the diagram along the line called the main sequence . During the stage of their lives in which stars are found on the main sequence line , they are fusing hydrogen in their cores . The next concentration of stars is on the horizontal branch ( helium fusion in the core and hydrogen burning in a shell surrounding the core ) . Another prominent feature is the Hertzsprung gap located in the region between A5 and G0 spectral type and between + 1 and âˆ’ 3 absolute magnitudes ( i.e. between the top of the main sequence and the giants in the horizontal branch ) . RR Lyrae variable stars can be found in the left of this gap on a section of the diagram called the instability strip . Cepheid variables also fall on the instability strip , at higher luminosities .
