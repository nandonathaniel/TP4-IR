In the preface to his book , the Muqaddimah ( 1377 ) , the Arab historian and early sociologist , Ibn Khaldun , warned of seven mistakes that he thought that historians regularly committed . In this criticism , he approached the past as strange and in need of interpretation . Ibn Khaldun often criticized `` idle superstition and uncritical acceptance of historical data . '' As a result , he introduced a scientific method to the study of history , and he often referred to it as his `` new science '' . His historical method also laid the groundwork for the observation of the role of state , communication , propaganda and systematic bias in history , and he is thus considered to be the `` father of historiography '' or the `` father of the philosophy of history '' .
