The song was composed in the key of D major with a tempo of 78 beats per minute . Sheeran 's vocals range from A to B. In the mix , Sheeran 's voice is `` unusually '' loud over the instruments , which , for Mike Senior of the music technology magazine , Sound on Sound , is `` surprisingly rare '' in contemporary records . Senior analysed the vocal elements in which he found that , in spite of several notes sung off pitch , `` the overall framework of the vocal remains fundamentally in tune '' .
