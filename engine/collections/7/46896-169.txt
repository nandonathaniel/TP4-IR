In terms of rhythm , English is generally described as a stress - timed language , meaning that the amount of time between stressed syllables tends to be equal . Stressed syllables are pronounced longer , but unstressed syllables ( syllables between stresses ) are shortened . Vowels in unstressed syllables are shortened as well , and vowel shortening causes changes in vowel quality : vowel reduction .
