The intense level of military co-operation between the UK and US began with the creation of the Combined Chiefs of Staff in December 1941 , a military command with authority over all US and British operations . Following the end of the Second World War the joint command structure was disbanded , but close military cooperation between the nations resumed in the early 1950s with the start of the Cold War .
