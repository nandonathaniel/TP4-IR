Some of the marriage settlements mentioned in the Iliad and Odyssey suggest that bride price was a custom of Homeric society . The language used for various marriage transactions , however , may blur distinctions between bride price and dowry , and a third practice called `` indirect dowry , '' whereby the groom hands over property to the bride which is then used to establish the new household . `` Homeric society '' is a fictional construct involving legendary figures and deities , though drawing on the historical customs of various times and places in the Greek world . At the time when the Homeric epics were composed , `` primitive '' practices such as bride price and polygamy were no longer part of Greek society . Mentions of them preserve , if they have a historical basis at all , customs dating from the Age of Migrations ( c. 1200 -- 1000 BCE ) and the two centuries following .
