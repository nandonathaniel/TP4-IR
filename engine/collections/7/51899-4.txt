Thus in determining whether to shut down a firm should compare total revenue to total variable costs ( VC ) rather than total costs ( FC ( fixed costs ) + VC ) . If the revenue the firm is receiving is greater than its variable cost ( R > VC ) then the firm is covering all variable cost plus there is additional revenue which partially or entirely offsets fixed costs . ( The size of the fixed costs is irrelevant as it is a sunk cost . The same consideration is used whether fixed costs are one dollar or one million dollars . ) On the other hand if VC > R then the firm is not even covering its production costs and it should immediately shut down . The rule is conventionally stated in terms of price ( average revenue ) and average variable costs . The rules are equivalent -- if one divides both sides of inequality TR > VC ( total revenue exceeds variable costs ) by the output quantity Q one obtains P > AVC ( price exceeds average variable cost ) ) . If the firm decides to operate it will produce where marginal revenue equals marginal costs because these conditions insure profit maximization ( or equivalently , when profit is negative , loss minimization ) .
