`` Reinforced concrete provided me with incredible resources , '' he wrote later , `` and variety , and a passionate plasticity in which by themselves my structures will be rhythm of a palace , and a Pompieen tranquility . '' . This led him to his plan for the Dom - Ino House ( 1914 -- 15 ) . This model proposed an open floor plan consisting of three concrete slabs supported by six thin reinforced concrete columns , with a stairway providing access to each level on one side of the floor plan . The system was originally designed to provide large numbers of temporary residences after World War I , producing only slabs , columns and stairways , and residents could build exterior wallls with the materials around the site . He described it in his patent application as `` a juxtiposable system of construction according to an infinite number of combinations of plans . This would permit , he wrote , `` the construction of the dividing walls at any point on the fa√ßade or the interior . ''
