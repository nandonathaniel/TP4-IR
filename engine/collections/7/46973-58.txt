Fresh river water flowing from the Mississippi into the Gulf of Mexico does not mix into the salt water immediately . The images from NASA 's MODIS ( to the right ) show a large plume of fresh water , which appears as a dark ribbon against the lighter - blue surrounding waters . These images demonstrate that the plume did not mix with the surrounding sea water immediately . Instead , it stayed intact as it flowed through the Gulf of Mexico , into the Straits of Florida , and entered the Gulf Stream . The Mississippi River water rounded the tip of Florida and traveled up the southeast coast to the latitude of Georgia before finally mixing in so thoroughly with the ocean that it could no longer be detected by MODIS .
