The strong prescription against ai n't in standard English has led to many misconceptions , often expressed jocularly ( or ironically ) , as `` ai n't ai n't a word '' or `` ai n't ai n't in the dictionary . '' Ai n't is listed in most dictionaries , including the Oxford Dictionary of English and Merriam - Webster . However , Oxford states `` it does not form part of standard English and should never be used in formal or written contexts , '' and Merriam - Webster states it is `` widely disapproved as non-standard and more common in the habitual speech of the less educated '' .
