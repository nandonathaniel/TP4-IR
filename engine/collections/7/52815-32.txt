The town was originally named Coal Creek when it was founded in the early 19th century , after the 1798 Treaty of Tellico opened the area to settlement , taking its name from the stream that runs through the town . Coal Creek and the nearby town of Briceville were the site of a major lockout of coal miners in 1891 , which resulted in the town of Coal Creek being occupied by the state militia for over a year after miners attempted to force an end to the use of unpaid convict labor in the mines . This labor struggle , known as the Coal Creek War , was eventually resolved in the coal miners ' favor with the abolition of Tennessee 's convict labor program . The Fraterville Mine disaster of 1902 occurred nearby , in the village of Fraterville .
