Areas are uniquely identified with 32 - bit numbers . The area identifiers are commonly written in the dot - decimal notation , familiar from IPv4 addressing . However , they are not IP addresses and may duplicate , without conflict , any IPv4 address . The area identifiers for IPv6 implementations ( OSPFv3 ) also use 32 - bit identifiers written in the same notation . When dotted formatting is omitted , most implementations expand area 1 to the area identifier 0.0. 0.1 , but some have been known to expand it as 1.0. 0.0 .
