Meanwhile , President Snow is arrested , found guilty of his crimes against the people of Panem , and sentenced to death . Per Katniss ' request , she is designated as his executioner . Before the execution , Snow tells Katniss that the bombs were n't his but the rebels ' way of gaining sympathy in the Capitol for their cause , making it look like the work of Snow . Although she initially refuses to believe Snow , Katniss realizes that the attack method was identical to a trap Gale and fellow Quarter Quell tribute Beetee had designed . Eventually , Katniss realizes that someone high up in the ranks of the Rebels would have had to order to have Prim on the front line , despite her age , and comes to suspect that Coin ordered the attack on the children in order to trick the Capitol citizens into thinking that the government had killed their children , therefore winning the loyalty of the Capitol 's citizens and that Prim was there solely to subdue and unhinge Katniss .
