Regardless of the place of birth , a child acquires Norwegian citizenship at birth if either parent is a Norwegian citizen . Originally , citizenship was only passed on to the children of Norwegian mothers , as they were the only provable parents , but over time a presumption of paternal parentage created citizenship for the child , and eventually even excluded the maternal jus sanguinis . In more recent times , as of 1 January 1979 , mothers ' rights to automatically pass on their Norwegian citizenship has been reestablished . The requirement that the mother and father be married to one another was abolished on 1 September 2006 .
