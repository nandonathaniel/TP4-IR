Pigeons , cats , and dogs were allowed to roam the mammoth set in order to give the `` town '' a lived - in feel . Due to the requirement to film in an `` alternate universe '' setting as well as during different seasons , the set was extremely adaptable . RKO created `` chemical snow '' for the film in order to avoid the need for dubbed dialogue when actors walked across the earlier type of movie snow , made up of crushed cornflakes . Filming started on April 15 , 1946 and ended on July 27 , 1946 , exactly on deadline for the 90 - day principal photography schedule .
