Instead , with Truman taking the initiative , they began to search for other , more acceptable , candidates . However , most of the other candidates had a major weakness . Richard Russell had much Southern support , but his support of racial segregation and opposition to civil rights for Southern blacks led many liberal Northern and Midwestern delegates to reject him . Truman favored W. Averell Harriman of New York , but he had never held an elective office and was inexperienced in politics . Truman next turned to his vice-president , Alben W. Barkley , but at 74 he was rejected as being too old by labor union leaders . Other minor or favorite son candidates included Oklahoma Senator Robert S. Kerr , Governor Paul A. Dever of Massachusetts , Senator Hubert Humphrey from Minnesota , and Senator J. William Fulbright from Arkansas .
