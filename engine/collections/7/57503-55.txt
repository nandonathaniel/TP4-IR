Twinning is the intergrowth of two or more crystal of a single mineral species . The geometry of the twinning is controlled by the mineral 's symmetry . As a result , there are several types of twins , including contact twins , reticulated twins , geniculated twins , penetration twins , cyclic twins , and polysynthetic twins . Contact , or simple twins , consist of two crystals joined at a plane ; this type of twinning is common in spinel . Reticulated twins , common in rutile , are interlocking crystals resembling netting . Geniculated twins have a bend in the middle that is caused by start of the twin . Penetration twins consist of two single crystals that have grown into each other ; examples of this twinning include cross-shaped staurolite twins and Carlsbad twinning in orthoclase . Cyclic twins are caused by repeated twinning around a rotation axis . It occurs around three , four , five , six , or eight-fold axes , and the corresponding patterns are called threelings , fourlings , fivelings , sixlings , and eightlings . Sixlings are common in aragonite . Polysynthetic twins are similar to cyclic twinning by the presence of repetitive twinning ; however , instead of occurring around a rotational axis , it occurs along parallel planes , usually on a microscopic scale .
