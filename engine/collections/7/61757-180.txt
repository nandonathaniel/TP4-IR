There were memorable encounters in the other European competitions . Borussia Dortmund 's wins over holders West Ham United and Liverpool ( final in Glasgow ) in the 1965 - 66 European Cup Winners ' Cup were memorable as were West Ham 's win over TSV 1860 Munich at Wembley Stadium in the final of the same competition a year earlier , Everton F.C. Everton 's semifinal elimination of Bayern in 1985 ( they went on to win the Cup Winners Cup and the league ) and Gianluca Vialli 's Chelsea 's win over VfB Stuttgart in the final of 1998 . The UEFA Cup , which became a strong competition in the late seventies , eighties and 90s , before being devalued in recent years , threw up some wonderful Anglo - German encounters , among the most memorable of which would be Ipswich Town 's victories both home and away over 1 . FC Köln in the semifinal of the 1981 competition which they won , Tottenham Hotspur 's 5 -- 1 aggregate mauling of Cologne in the 1974 competition and defeat of Bayern ten years later when winning the competition for the second time , debutant Watford 's comeback against Kaiserslautern in the first round of the 1983 -- 84 competition , Bayern 's thrashing of Nottingham Forest F.C. Nottingham Forest 7 -- 2 on aggregate -- after Forest had held Bayern to a 1 -- 1 draw in the first leg in Munich -- in 1996 en route to winning the cup , debutant Norwich City 's win at the Olympia Stadion in Munich before ousting Bayern at Carrow Road in 1993 and Kaiserlautern 's final minutes turn around against Tottenham Hotspur , managed by George Graham , in 1999 . More recently , in 2009 Hamburg eliminated Manchester City who had earlier in the campaign beaten Schalke in Germany , a team they also beat 5 -- 1 in the quarter finals of the 1969 - 70 European Cup Winners ' Cup which City went on to win . Reinhard Libuda played for Schalke at that time ( 1969 -- 70 ) while City had the famous trio of Francis Lee , Colin Bell and Mike Summerbee . The English hold the upperhand even in these competitions . There were however some narrow escapes . Liverpool won their 1973 UEFA Cup Final first leg at Anfield 3 -- 0 only for Borussia Mönchengladbach to pull back to 3 -- 2 on aggregate by half - time . The Reds hung on in the second half . In 1976 , Queens Park Rangers , also making their debut , with Stan Bowles , Dave Thomas and Don Givens in their ranks , took a 3 -- 0 lead to the Mungersdorfer Stadion in Cologne and increased their lead there only for the Germans to storm back with four goals and miss out on qualification on the away goals rule .
