Executive Orders are presidential directives issued by United States Presidents and are generally directed towards officers and agencies of the U.S. federal government . Executive orders may have the force of law , if based on the authority derived from statute or the Constitution itself . The ability to make such orders is also based on express or implied Acts of Congress that delegate to the President some degree of discretionary power ( delegated legislation ) .
