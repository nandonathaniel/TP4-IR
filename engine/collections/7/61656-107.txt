In 1980 , Carry On actress Hattie Jacques appeared in the advert as a school crossing patrol officer . Between 1981 and 1985 , Asda used the slogan ' All Together Better ' in conjunction with the ' Asda Price ' pocket tap campaign in TV commercials and newspaper and magazine advertisements . When the new green capitalised ASDA logo started to appear from 1985 , in early 1986 onwards and until early 1989 , two slogans were used . The first , ' You 'd be off your trolley to go anywhere else ' , was replaced in 1987 by ' One trip and you 're laughing ' . Celebrities including Joanna Lumley , Harry Enfield , Victoria Wood and Julie Walters featured in these adverts pushing their trolleys past Asda counter displays filmed in more ' exotic ' locations to show the broad range of fresh food products that Asda offered from countries such as France and Italy .
