The third generation MacBook Pro received positive reviews of the Retina Display , flash storage and power . It was criticized , however , for its high price and lack of an Ethernet port and optical drive . Roman Loyola of Macworld said that the Retina MacBook Pro was `` groundbreaking '' and made people `` rethink how they use technology '' . He praised the inclusion of USB 3.0 and the slimmer body . Dan Ackerman of CNET commented `` I 've previously called the 15 - inch MacBook Pro one of the most universally useful all - around laptops you can buy . This new version adds to that with HDMI , faster ports , and more portability . But it also subtracts from that with its exclusion of an optical drive and Ethernet port , plus its very high starting price . The Pro and Retina Pro are clearly two laptops designed for two different users , and with the exception of all - day commuters who need something closer to a MacBook Air or ultrabook , one of the two branches of the MacBook Pro family tree is still probably the most universally useful laptop you can buy .
