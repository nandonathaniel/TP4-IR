In 1970 , the Soviet Union planned for a 1975 first Martian sample - return mission in the Mars 5NM project . This mission was planned to use an N1 rocket , but as this rocket never flew successfully , the mission evolved into the Mars 5M project , which would use a double launch with the smaller Proton rocket and an assembly at a Salyut space station . This Mars 5M mission was planned for 1979 , but got canceled in 1977 due to technical problems and complexity ; all hardware was ordered destroyed .
