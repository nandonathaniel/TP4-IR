An increased intracellular ATP : ADP ratio closes the ATP - sensitive SUR1 / Kir6. 2 potassium channel ( see sulfonylurea receptor ) . This prevents potassium ions ( K ) from leaving the cell by facilitated diffusion , leading to a buildup of intracellular potassium ions . As a result , the inside of the cell becomes less negative with respect to the outside , leading to the depolarization of the cell surface membrane .
