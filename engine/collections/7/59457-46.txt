The word Punjab is a compound of the Persian words panj ( five ) and āb ( waters ) . Thus Panjāb roughly means `` the land of five rivers '' . The five rivers are the Sutlej , Beas , Ravi , Chenab and Jehlum ( also spelled Jhelum ) . Traditionally , in English , there used to be a definite article before the name , i.e. `` The Punjab '' . The name is also sometimes spelled as `` Panjab '' .
