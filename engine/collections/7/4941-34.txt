While the lyrics describe a girl `` riding out of the life of the narrator '' , the inspiration of the title phrase is unclear , as is the meaning of the song . McCartney said the title referred to `` a British Railways ticket to the town of Ryde on the Isle of Wight '' , and Lennon said it described cards indicating a clean bill of health carried by Hamburg prostitutes in the 1960s . The Beatles played in Hamburg early in their musical career , and a `` ride '' was British slang for having sex . Gaby Whitehill and Andrew Trendall of Gigwise have interpreted the song to be about a woman leaving her boyfriend to become a prostitute .
