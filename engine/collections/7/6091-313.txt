Although the speed limit can be raised to 70 mph based on engineering studies under current law , ODOT has not identified any freeway sections that it believes should be raised beyond the 65 mph limit . In 2004 , ODOT had released an engineering study on the average and 85th percentile speeds on interstate highways . This study found that the 85th percentile speed on rural interstates by passenger cars was 71.1 mph with a statewide average of 66.3 mph . The engineering study recommended raising the speed limit on rural interstates to 70 mph . Despite this , ODOT initially refused to post the 70 mph limit due to safety concerns and its associated monetary costs ; however , there appears to be no higher fatality levels in other states when the limit was raised . In all rural areas in Oregon , the speed limit is 55 unless otherwise posted .
