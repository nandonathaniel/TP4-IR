Popular uproar across Cuba demanded that those figures who had been complicit in the widespread torture and killing of civilians be brought to justice . Although he remained a moderating force and tried to prevent the mass reprisal killings of Batistanos advocated by many Cubans , Castro helped to set up trials of many figures involved in the old regime across the country , resulting in hundreds of executions . Critics , in particular from the U.S. press , argued that many of these did not meet the standards of a fair trial , and condemned Cuba 's new government as being more interested in vengeance than justice . Castro retaliated strongly against such accusations , proclaiming that `` revolutionary justice is not based on legal precepts , but on moral conviction . '' In a show of support for this `` revolutionary justice '' , he organized the first Havana trial to take place before a mass audience of 17,000 at the Sports Palace stadium ; when a group of aviators accused of bombing a village were found not guilty , he ordered a retrial , in which they were instead found guilty and sentenced to life imprisonment . On 11 March 1961 , Jesus Carreras and American William Alexander Morgan ( a former Castro ally ) were executed after a trial .
