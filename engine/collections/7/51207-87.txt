La Paz is the state capital and center of commerce , as well as the home of the three leading marine biology institutes in Latin America ( UABCS , CIBNOR & CICIMAR ) , largely because it sits on the Gulf of California , which is home to exceptional marine biodiversity . It also supports several other university - level institutes of learning , such as the Universidad Autonoma de Baja California Sur .
