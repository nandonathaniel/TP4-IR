According to Sela , on - board ARRIRAW recording with the ALEXA XT cameras made a considerable difference with camerawork , stating , `` Having the ALEXA XT with in - camera ARRIRAW is like going to back to an ARRICAM or an ARRIFLEX 435 , which is amazing . '' There was a considerable amount of handheld camera work on the second section of John Wick and usage of the ALEXA M allowed filming `` to squeeze through the window or into restricted spaces '' to occur , especially for the car scenes . Sela was recording ARRIRAW and used the whole sensor area of ALEXA 's 4 : 3 for the anamorphic scenes , which allowed for the maximisation of the image quality for a 4K cinema release . Of such a decision the following was stated , `` Shooting in ARRIRAW and having that extra sensor area helps most when you need to manipulate the image ; you 'll notice it when you have to adjust the color or contrast in a scene because you simply have more information to work with .
