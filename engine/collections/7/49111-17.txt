The partially assembled Little Boy gun - type fission weapon L - 11 , weighing 10,000 pounds ( 4,500 kg ) , was contained inside a 41 - inch ( 100 cm ) x 47 - inch ( 120 cm ) x 138 - inch ( 350 cm ) wooden crate that was secured to the deck of the USS Indianapolis . Unlike the six uranium - 235 target discs , which were later flown to Tinian on three separate aircraft arriving 28 and 29 July , the assembled projectile with the nine uranium - 235 rings installed was shipped in a single lead - lined steel container weighing 300 pounds ( 140 kg ) that was locked to brackets welded to the deck of Captain Charles B. McVay III 's quarters . Both the L - 11 and projectile were dropped off at Tinian on 26 July 1945 .
