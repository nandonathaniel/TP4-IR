`` At the beginning of the season , my writers and I were planning out Viola 's entire arc and something in her story organically came up that was very appropriate for Scandal . When I went to Shonda , she heard it . I said , we do n't have to do it , Viola 's arc does n't need this , but it 's possible that their stories could cross really organically . She actually pulled up a clip of something from Scandal and their side of the story coalesced perfectly . So it was one of those serendipitous things where we both realized it was good for both characters , and it almost felt like we had been planning it since last season . ''
