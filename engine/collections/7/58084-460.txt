A large - scale 37 - nation poll of world opinion carried out by Gallup International in late September 2001 found that large majorities in most countries favored a legal response , in the form of extradition and trial , over a military response to 9 / 11 : only three countries out of the 37 surveyed -- the U.S. , Israel and India -- did majorities favor military action . In the other 34 countries surveyed , the poll found many clear majorities that favored extradition and trial instead of military action : in the United Kingdom ( 75 % ) , France ( 67 % ) , Switzerland ( 87 % ) , Czech Republic ( 64 % ) , Lithuania ( 83 % ) , Panama ( 80 % ) and Mexico ( 94 % ) .
