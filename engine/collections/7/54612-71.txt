Principal photography had begun by January 21 , 2017 , at EUE / Screen Gems Studios in the Atlanta metropolitan area , under the working title Motherland . Filming also took place in the Sweet Auburn neighborhood in Atlanta , which doubled as Oakland ; the High Museum of Art , which served as the fictional Museum of Great Britain in London ; and Atlanta City Hall , which served as a United Nations building . Cinematographer Rachel Morrison , who was eager to work on Black Panther after working with Coogler on Fruitvale Station , first watched all of the other MCU films to understand the established `` language '' . She wanted to `` push '' that language and feature more contrast in color . Visual effects supervisor Geoff Baumann provided Morrison with before - and - after shots of scenes from Civil War so she could understand what elements are captured on set and what is created digitally . She filmed in 3.4 K ArriRaw with Arri Alexa XT Plus cameras and Panavision Primo lenses , primarily using a two - camera set - up with a third or fourth camera on occasion . Morrison said that lighting was her biggest challenge , the magnitude of which `` was much bigger than I 'd experienced before '' , and made extensive use of Arri SkyPanel LED light fixtures , which she could preprogram from an iPad . Some sets were completely surrounded by SkyPanels .
