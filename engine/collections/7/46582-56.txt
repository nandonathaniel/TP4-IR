Some studies of David have been written : Baruch Halpern has pictured David as a lifelong vassal of Achish , the Philistine king of Gath ; Israel Finkelstein and Neil Asher Silberman have identified as the oldest and most reliable section of Samuel those chapters which describe David as the charismatic leader of a band of outlaws who captures Jerusalem and makes it his capital . Steven McKenzie , Associate Professor of the Hebrew Bible at Rhodes College and author of King David : A Biography , states the belief that David actually came from a wealthy family , was `` ambitious and ruthless '' and a tyrant who murdered his opponents , including his own sons .
