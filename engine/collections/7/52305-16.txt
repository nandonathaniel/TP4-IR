An approved 501 ( c ) ( 3 ) exemption allows donors to the organization to reduce their own taxable incomes by deducting the amounts of their donations given , and thus to reduce their personal income taxes , and it allows the 501 ( c ) ( 3 ) organization to avoid federal income taxes on the difference between revenues ( donations , grants , service fees ) received vs. expenses ( wages , supplies , state and local taxes paid , etc . ) in its main operations . In a for - profit business , that difference would represent taxable income and be taxed at federal corporate tax rates of 15 to 39 percent . Organizations with 501 ( c ) ( 3 ) status may also be exempt from state and local corporate income taxes , which generally range from 0 to 12 percent .
