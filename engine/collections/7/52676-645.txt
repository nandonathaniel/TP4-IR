I think that it is more correct to say that the law was unsettled , because the SC had never interpreted it . No lower court decision would be binding outside its jurisdiction .

While other cases skirted this issue , this was the first full review of the 2nd amendment . The fact that 39 states have adopted `` shall issue '' permits or `` permit not needed '' and 9 states have adopted `` may issue '' permit laws , shows the ruling did not completely changed the legal landscape . Gun control supporters will never accept this view but the issue is now settled and the ruling is now the law of the land .
