Eukaryotes often have multiple origins of replication on each linear chromosome that initiate at different times ( replication timing ) , with up to 100,000 present in a single human cell . Having many origins of replication helps to speed the duplication of their ( usually ) much larger store of genetic material . The segment of DNA that is copied starting from each unique replication origin is called a replicon .
