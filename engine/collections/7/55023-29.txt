After Gilligan 's Island , Johnson found himself somewhat typecast , making it harder to portray more non-sophisticated roles other than his signature role as the Professor . Nevertheless , he was able to resume a sufficient acting career , appearing in several other movies and television shows , especially in the latter . He appeared as a guest star in several dramatic series , including The Big Valley with Peter Breck ( marking a reunion of sorts , since the two of them co-starred together in `` Black Saddle '' , an earlier Four Star Productions series ) , The Invaders , Death Valley Days , Owen Marshall : Counselor at Law , Lassie , That Girl , Ironside , The F.B.I , and Gunsmoke . He was cast in the miniseries Vanished , based on a novel by Fletcher Knebel ( 1971 ) , the TV horror movie The Horror at 37,000 Feet ( 1973 ) , uncredited in the Robert Redford spy thriller Three Days of the Condor ( 1975 ) , the low - budget thriller Hitch Hike to Hell ( 1977 ) , and appeared on the episode `` Coffee , Tea or Cyanide '' ' on McMillan and Wife in 1977 , and on the NBC soap opera Santa Barbara .
