The conclusion of the final settlement cleared the way for the unification of East and West Germany . Formal political union occurred on 3 October 1990 , preceded by the GDR declaring its accession to the Federal Republic through Article 23 of West Germany 's Basic Law ( meaning that constitutionally , East Germany was subsumed into West Germany ) ; but affected in strict legality through the subsequent Unification Treaty of 30 August 1990 , which was voted into their constitutions by both the West German Bundestag and the East German Volkskammer on 20 September 1990 . These votes simultaneously extinguished the GDR and affected fundamental amendments to the West German Basic Law ( including the repeal of the very Article 23 under which the GDR had recently declared its post-dated accession ) . On 2 December 1990 , all - German elections were held for the first time since 1933 . The `` new '' country stayed the same as the West German legal system and institutions were extended to the east . The unified nation kept the name Bundesrepublik Deutschland ( though the simple ' Deutschland ' would become increasingly common ) and retained the West German `` Deutsche Mark '' for currency as well . Berlin would formally become the capital of the united Germany , but the political institutions remained at Bonn for the time being . Only after a heated 1991 debate did the Bundestag conclude on moving itself and most of the government to Berlin as well , a process that took until 1999 to complete , when the Bundestag held its first session at the reconstructed Reichstag building . Many government departments still maintain sizable presences in Bonn as of 2008 .
