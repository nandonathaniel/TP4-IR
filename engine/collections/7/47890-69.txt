Barfy ( vocal effects provided by Fred Tatasciore ) - is a purple barfing dog that Sanjay wants to adopt . He entered the contest to win Barfy for free 100 times ; the plan was successful , but it also backfired , as Sanjay ended up winning not only Barfy but also 99 other dogs . Barfy was given to Farmer Larry because Mr. Noodman would harass the purple dog and also because Farmer Larry needed some blueberry dogs . Barfy returns in the episode `` Barfy 's Babies '' , when she gave birth the three puppies named Barfy Jr. , Lil ' Beef , and Puppy .
