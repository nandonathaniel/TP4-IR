In August 1914 , 300,000 men had signed up to fight , and another 450,000 had joined - up by the end of September . Recruitment remained fairly steady through 1914 and early 1915 , but it fell dramatically during the later years , especially after the Somme campaign , which resulted in 360,000 casualties . A prominent feature of the early months of volunteering was the formation of Pals battalions . Many of these pals who had lived and worked together , joined up and trained together and were allocated to the same units . The policy of drawing recruits from amongst the local population ensured that , when the Pals battalions suffered casualties , whole towns , villages , neighbourhoods and communities back in Britain were to suffer disproportionate losses . With the introduction of conscription in January 1916 , no further Pals battalions were raised . Conscription for single men was introduced in January 1916 . Four months later , in May 1916 , it was extended to all men aged 18 to 41 . The Military Service Act 1916 specified that men from the ages of 18 to 41 were liable to be called up for service in the army , unless they were married ( or widowed with children ) , or served in one of a number of reserved occupations , which were usually industrial but which also included clergymen and teachers . This legislation did not apply to Ireland , despite its then status as part of the United Kingdom ( but see Conscription Crisis of 1918 ) . By January 1916 , when conscription was introduced , 2.6 million men had volunteered for service , a further 2.3 million were conscripted before the end of the war ; by the end of 1918 , the army had reached its peak strength of four million men .
