William Sandys who between 1636 and 1639 made the Avon navigable from Tewkesbury to Stratford - upon - Avon was at the same time also authorised to improve the Teme between Worcester and Ludlow . There is however no evidence that he did so , perhaps due to his having used up all his resources on the Avon . Having failed to recover the Avon after the Restoration , Sir William Sandys and his son undertook work on the Wye and Lugg .
