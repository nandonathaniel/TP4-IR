The Russo - Turkish War of 1877 -- 1878 had its origins in a rise in nationalism in the Balkans as well as in the Russian goal of recovering territorial losses it had suffered during the Crimean War , reestablishing itself in the Black Sea and following the political movement attempting to free Balkan nations from the Ottoman Empire . As a result of the war , the principalities of Romania , Serbia and Montenegro , each of which had de facto sovereignty for some time , formally proclaimed independence from the Ottoman Empire . After almost half a millennium of Ottoman domination ( 1396 -- 1878 ) , the Bulgarian state was reestablished as the Principality of Bulgaria , covering the land between the Danube River and the Balkan Mountains ( except Northern Dobrudja which was given to Romania ) and the region of Sofia , which became the new state 's capital . The Congress of Berlin also allowed Austria - Hungary to occupy Bosnia and Herzegovina and Great Britain to take over Cyprus , while the Russian Empire annexed Southern Bessarabia and the Kars region .
