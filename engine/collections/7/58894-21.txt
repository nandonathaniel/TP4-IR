Bone pain affects almost 70 % of patients and is the most common symptom . Myeloma bone pain usually involves the spine and ribs , and worsens with activity . Persistent localized pain may indicate a pathological bone fracture . Involvement of the vertebrae may lead to spinal cord compression or kyphosis . Myeloma bone disease is due to the overexpression of receptor activator for nuclear factor Îº B ligand ( RANKL ) by bone marrow stroma . RANKL activates osteoclasts , which resorb bone . The resultant bone lesions are lytic ( cause breakdown ) in nature , and are best seen in plain radiographs , which may show `` punched - out '' resorptive lesions ( including the `` raindrop '' appearance of the skull on radiography ) . The breakdown of bone also leads to the release of calcium into the blood , leading to hypercalcemia and its associated symptoms .
