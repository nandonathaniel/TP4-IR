Users can remove rarely - used apps without losing the app 's data using the `` Offload App '' button . This allows for a later reinstallation of the app ( if available on the App Store ) , in which data returns and usage can continue . Users can also have those apps removed automatically with the `` Offload Unused Apps '' setting . When an app is offloaded , the app appears on the home screen as a grayed - out icon .
