The famous order `` Do n't fire until you see the whites of their eyes '' was popularized in stories about the battle of Bunker Hill . It is uncertain as to who said it there , since various histories , including eyewitness accounts , attribute it to Putnam , Stark , Prescott , or Gridley , and it may have been said first by one , and repeated by the others . It was also not an original statement . The idea dates originally to the general - king Gustavus Adolphus ( 1594 -- 1632 ) who gave standing orders to his musketeers : `` never to give fire , till they could see their own image in the pupil of their enemy 's eye '' . Gustavus Adolphus 's military teachings were widely admired and imitated and caused this saying to be often repeated . It was used by General James Wolfe on the Plains of Abraham , when his troops defeated Montcalm 's army on September 13 , 1759 . The earliest similar quote came from the Battle of Dettingen on June 27 , 1743 , where Lieutenant - Colonel Sir Andrew Agnew of Lochnaw warned his Regiment , the Royal Scots Fusiliers , not to fire until they could `` see the white of their e'en . '' The phrase was also used by Prince Charles of Prussia in 1745 , and repeated in 1755 by Frederick the Great , and may have been mentioned in histories the colonial military leaders were familiar with . Whether or not it was actually said in this battle , it was clear that the colonial military leadership were regularly reminding their troops to hold their fire until the moment when it would have the greatest effect , especially in situations where their ammunition would be limited .
