Chinese calendar defines the lunar month with winter solstice as the 11th month , which means that Chinese New Year usually falls on the second new moon after the winter solstice ( rarely the third if an intercalary month intervenes ) . In more than 96 % of the years , the Chinese New Year 's Day is the closest new moon to lichun ( Chinese : 立春 ; `` start of spring '' ) on 4 or 5 February , and the first new moon after Dahan ( Chinese : 大寒 ; `` major cold '' ) . In the Gregorian calendar , the Lunar New Year begins at the new moon that falls between 21 January and 20 February .
