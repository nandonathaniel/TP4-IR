Gas in liquid : Oxygen in water Carbon dioxide in water -- a less simple example , because the solution is accompanied by a chemical reaction ( formation of ions ) . Note also that the visible bubbles in carbonated water are not the dissolved gas , but only an effervescence of carbon dioxide that has come out of solution ; the dissolved gas itself is not visible since it is dissolved on a molecular level .
