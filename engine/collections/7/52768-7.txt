Artists in the eighteenth century ( e.g. , Henry Fuseli , William Rimmer ) depicted the witches variously , as have many directors since . Some have exaggerated or sensationalised the hags , or have adapted them to different cultures , as in Orson Welles 's rendition of the weird sisters as voodoo priestesses . Some film adaptations have cast the witches as such modern analogues as hippies on drugs , or goth schoolgirls . Their influence reaches the literary realm as well in such works as the Discworld and Harry Potter series .
