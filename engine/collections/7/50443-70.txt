In 1930 Texas historian Clarence Wharton published San Jacinto : The Sixteenth Decisive Battle , in which he made the case for adding the final battle of the Texas Revolution to Creasy 's list . In 1936 the San Jacinto Monument was given an inscription that echoed Wharton 's view : `` Measured by its results , San Jacinto was one of the decisive battles of the world . The freedom of Texas from Mexico won here led to annexation and to the Mexican -- American War , resulting in the acquisition by the United States of the states of Texas , New Mexico , Arizona , Nevada , California , Utah and parts of Colorado , Wyoming , Kansas and Oklahoma . Almost one - third of the present area of the American Nation , nearly a million square miles of territory , changed sovereignty . ''
