The X Games gained media exposure due to their big name sponsors , top - tier athletes , and consistent fan attendance . As the Journal of Sport Management ( 2006 ) explains , Generation X and Generation Y are the two demographics most highly valued by marketers . This creates a broad approach on marketing towards that certain demographic , which is why the X Games marketing and economic outlook is so `` out of the box '' . According to ESPN ( 2008 ) , in the Winter X Games inaugural year , 1997 , 38,000 spectators attended the four - day event . In 1998 , the attendance dropped to 25,000 spectators . But just two years later , a record attendance of 83,500 people attended the Winter X Games ' East Coast debut . The X Games and Winter X Games continue to grow with the popularity of action sports and the athletes who compete in them .
