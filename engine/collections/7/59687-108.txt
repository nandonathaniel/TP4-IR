A common abbreviation for acetic acid is AcOH , where Ac stands for the acetyl group CH − C ( = O ) − . Acetate ( CH COO ) is abbreviated AcO . The Ac is not to be confused with the abbreviation for the chemical element actinium . To better reflect its structure , acetic acid is often written as CH -- C ( O ) OH , CH − C ( = O ) OH , CH COOH , and CH CO H. In the context of acid - base reactions , the abbreviation HAc is sometimes used , where Ac in this case is a symbol for acetate ( rather than acetyl ) . Acetate is the ion resulting from loss of H from acetic acid . The name acetate can also refer to a salt containing this anion , or an ester of acetic acid .
