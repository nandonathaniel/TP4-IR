A football game is played between two teams of 11 players each . Playing with more on the field is punishable by a penalty . Teams may substitute any number of their players between downs ; this `` platoon '' system replaced the original system , which featured limited substitution rules , and has resulted in teams utilizing specialized offensive , defensive and special teams squads .
