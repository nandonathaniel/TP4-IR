The soft palate is tensed by tensor palatini ( Vc ) , and then elevated by levator palatini ( pharyngeal plexus -- IX , X ) to close the nasopharynx . There is also the simultaneous approximation of the walls of the pharynx to the posterior free border of the soft palate , which is carried out by the palatopharyngeus ( pharyngeal plexus -- IX , X ) and the upper part of the superior constrictor ( pharyngeal plexus -- IX , X ) .
