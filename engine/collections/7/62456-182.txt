The AWSA aimed for close ties with the Republican Party , hoping that the ratification of the Fifteenth Amendment would lead to a Republican push for women 's suffrage . The NWSA , while determined to be politically independent , was critical of the Republicans . Anthony and Stanton wrote a letter to the 1868 Democratic National Convention that criticized Republican sponsorship of the Fourteenth Amendment ( which granted citizenship to black men but for the first time introduced the word `` male '' into the Constitution ) , saying , `` While the dominant party has with one hand lifted up two million black men and crowned them with the honor and dignity of citizenship , with the other it has dethroned fifteen million white women -- their own mothers and sisters , their own wives and daughters -- and cast them under the heel of the lowest orders of manhood . '' They urged liberal Democrats to convince their party , which did not have a clear direction at that point , to embrace universal suffrage .
