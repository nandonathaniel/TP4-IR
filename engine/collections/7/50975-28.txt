The Little Boy was 120 inches ( 300 cm ) in length , 28 inches ( 71 cm ) in diameter and weighed approximately 9,700 pounds ( 4,400 kg ) . The design used the gun method to explosively force a hollow sub-critical mass of uranium - 235 and a solid target cylinder together into a super-critical mass , initiating a nuclear chain reaction . This was accomplished by shooting one piece of the uranium onto the other by means of four cylindrical silk bags of cordite . The bomb contained 64 kg ( 141 lb ) of enriched uranium . Most was enriched to 89 % but some was only 50 % uranium - 235 , for an average enrichment of 80 % . Less than a kilogram of uranium underwent nuclear fission , and of this mass only 0.6 g ( 0.021 oz ) was transformed into several forms of energy , mostly kinetic energy , but also heat and radiation .
