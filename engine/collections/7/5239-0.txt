A civil service commission is a government agency that is constituted by legislature to regulate the employment and working conditions of civil servants , oversee hiring and promotions , and promote the values of the public service . Its role is roughly analogous to that of the human resources department in corporations . Civil service commissions are often independent from elected politicians -
