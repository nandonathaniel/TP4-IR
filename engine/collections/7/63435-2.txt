First Communion is not celebrated in the Eastern Orthodox churches , the Oriental Orthodox churches , or the Assyrian Church of the East , as they practice infant communion ( which often is simultaneously administered with paedobaptism and confirmation ) . Some Anglicans allow infant communion ( also called `` paedocommunion '' ) , while others require the previous reception of confirmation , usually during the teenage years .
