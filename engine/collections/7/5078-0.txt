A nuclear localization signal or sequence ( NLS ) is an amino acid sequence that ' tags ' a protein for import into the cell nucleus by nuclear transport . Typically , this signal consists of one or more short sequences of positively charged lysines or arginines exposed on the protein surface . Different nuclear localized proteins may share the same NLS . An NLS has the opposite function of a nuclear export signal ( NES ) , which targets proteins out of the nucleus .
