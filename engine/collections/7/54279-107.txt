The board arrived on 21 February and took testimony from survivors , witnesses and divers ( who were sent down to investigate the wreck ) . The Sampson Board produced its findings in two parts : the proceedings , which consisted mainly of testimonies , and the findings , which were the facts , as determined by the court . Between the proceedings and the findings , there was , what Wegner calls , `` a broad gap '' , where the court `` left no record of the reasoning that carried it from the often -- inconsistent witnesses to ( its ) conclusion . '' Another inconsistency , according to Wegner , was that of only one technical witness , Commander George Converse , from the Torpedo Station at Newport , Rhode Island . Captain Sampson read Commander Converse a hypothetical situation of a coal bunker fire igniting the reserve six - inch ammunition , with a resulting explosion sinking the ship . He then asked Commander Converse about the feasibility of such a scenario . Commander Converse `` simply stated , without elaboration , that he could not realize such an event happening '' .
