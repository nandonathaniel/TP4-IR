Drinking in public was outlawed in New York City by Ed Koch in 1979 . The law was originally pitched as targeting antisocial derelicts congregating in parks and on sidewalks , with Frederick E. Samuel , one of the measure 's proponents in the New York City Council , stating `` We do not recklessly expect the police to give a summons to a Con Ed worker having a beer with his lunch '' . By the end of the year similar laws had spread to municipalities in Westchester County . In March 2016 , drinking in public in Manhattan was decriminalized .
