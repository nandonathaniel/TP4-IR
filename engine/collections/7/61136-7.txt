In Australia , debit and credit cards are the most common non-cash payment methods at `` points of sale '' ( POS ) or via ATMs . Not all merchants provide eftpos facilities , but those who wish to accept eftpos payments must enter an agreement with one of the seven merchant service providers , which rent an eftpos terminal to the merchant . The eftpos system in Australia is managed by Eftpos Payments Australia Ltd , which also sets the EFTPOS interchange fee . For credit cards to be accepted by a merchant a separate agreement must be entered into with each credit card company , each of which has its own flexible merchant fee rate .
