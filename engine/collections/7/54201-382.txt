The Emancipation Proclamation was an executive order issued by President Lincoln on January 1 , 1863 . In a single stroke it changed the legal status , as recognized by the U.S. government , of 3 million slaves in designated areas of the Confederacy from `` slave '' to `` free '' . It had the practical effect that as soon as a slave escaped the control of the Confederate government , by running away or through advances of federal troops , the slave became legally and actually free . Plantation owners , realizing that emancipation would destroy their economic system , sometimes moved their slaves as far as possible out of reach of the Union army . By June 1865 , the Union Army controlled all of the Confederacy and had liberated all of the designated slaves .
