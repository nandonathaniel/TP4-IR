While the Indian subcontinent has had invaders from Central Asia since ancient times , what made the Muslim invasions different is that unlike the preceding invaders who assimilated into the prevalent social system , the successful Muslim conquerors retained their Islamic identity and created new legal and administrative systems that challenged and usually in many cases superseded the existing systems of social conduct and ethics , even influencing the non-Muslim rivals and common masses to a large extent , though the non-Muslim population was left to their own laws and customs . They also introduced new cultural codes that in some ways were very different from the existing cultural codes . This led to the rise of a new Indian culture which was mixed in nature , different from ancient Indian culture . The overwhelming majority of Muslims in India were Indian natives converted to Islam . This factor also played an important role in the synthesis of cultures .
