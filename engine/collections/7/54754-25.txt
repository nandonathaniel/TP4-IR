For a solid that dissolves in a redox reaction , solubility is expected to depend on the potential ( within the range of potentials under which the solid remains the thermodynamically stable phase ) . For example , solubility of gold in high - temperature water is observed to be almost an order of magnitude higher ( i.e. about ten times higher ) when the redox potential is controlled using a highly oxidizing Fe O - Fe O redox buffer than with a moderately oxidizing Ni - NiO buffer .
