At the beginning of the performance Beuys locked the gallery doors from the inside , leaving the gallery - goers outside . They could observe the scene within only through the windows . With his head entirely coated in honey and gold leaf , he began to explain pictures to a dead hare . Whispering to the dead animal on his arm in an apparent dialog , he processed through the exhibit from artwork to artwork . Occasionally he would stop and return to the center of the gallery , where he stepped over a dead fir tree that lay on the floor . After three hours the public was let into the room . Beuys sat upon a stool in the entrance area with the hare on his arm and his back to the onlookers .
