The P - site ( for peptidyl ) is the second binding site for tRNA in the ribosome . The other two sites are the A-site ( aminoacyl ) , which is the first binding site in the ribosome , and the E-site ( exit ) , is the third and final binding site in the ribosome . During Protein translation , the P - site holds the tRNA which is linked to the growing polypeptide chain . When a stop codon is reached , the peptidyl - tRNA bond of the tRNA located in the P - site is cleaved releasing the newly synthesized protein . During the translocation step of the elongation phase , the mRNA is advanced by one codon , coupled to movement of the tRNAs from the ribosomal A to P and P to E sites , catalyzed by elongation factor EF - G .
