The phrase `` objects in ( the ) mirror are closer than they appear '' is a safety warning that is required to be engraved on passenger side mirrors of motor vehicles in the USA , Canada , Nepal , India and Saudi Arabia . It is present because while these mirrors ' convexity gives them a useful field of view , it also makes objects appear smaller . Since smaller - appearing objects seem farther away than they actually are , a driver might make a maneuver such as a lane change assuming an adjacent vehicle is a safe distance behind , when in fact it is quite a bit closer . The warning serves as a reminder to the driver of this potential problem .
