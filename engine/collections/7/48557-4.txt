Gold was discovered in the area known as Witwatersrand , triggering what would become the Witwatersrand Gold Rush of 1886 . Like the diamond discoveries before , the gold rush caused thousands of foreign expatriates to flock to the region . This heightened political tensions in the area ultimately contributing to the Second Boer War in 1899 . Ownership of the diamond and gold mines became concentrated in the hands of a few entrepreneurs , largely of European origin , known as the Randlords . South Africa 's and the world 's biggest diamond miner , De Beers , was funded by baron Nathaniel Mayer Rothschild in 1887 , and Cecil Rhodes became the Founding Chairman of the board of directors in 1888 . Cecil Rhodes ' place was later taken by sir Ernest Oppenheimer , co-founder of the Anglo - American Corporation with J.P. Morgan .
