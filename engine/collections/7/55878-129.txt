When Smokey and the Bandit first aired on American network television in the early 1980s , censors were faced with the challenge of toning down the raw language of the original film . For this purpose , they overdubbed dialogue deemed offensive , which was ( and remains , to an extent ) common practice . The most noted change made for network broadcast was the replacing of Buford 's often - spoken phrase `` sumbitch '' ( a contraction of `` son of a bitch '' ; usually in reference to the Bandit ) with the phrase `` scum bum '' . This phrase achieved a level of popularity with children , and the 2007 Hot Wheels release of the 1970s Firebird Trans Am has `` scum bum '' emblazoned on its tail . The TV prints of the first two Bandit films are still shown regularly on television , although a few TV stations aired the unedited version in recent years as some of the phraseology ( i.e. `` ( son of a ) bitch '' , `` ass '' , etc . ) became more acceptable on TV .
