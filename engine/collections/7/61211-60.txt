The `` Elizabethan '' was a flagship express that ran non-stop over the 393 miles ( 632 km ) between London King 's Cross and Edinburgh Waverley from 1953 to the mid-1960s . Until September 1961 it was steam - hauled . In its day it was the longest non-stop run in the world . Two crews were needed for the six - and - a-half - hour run . They were able to change over mid-journey by using a corridor tender . Only a few locomotives other than Mallard had such a tender .
