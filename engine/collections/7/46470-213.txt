( T ) hrough the guardianship ( Velayat ) that I have from the holy lawgiver ( the Prophet ) , I hereby pronounce Bazargan as the Ruler , and since I have appointed him , he must be obeyed . The nation must obey him . This is not an ordinary government . It is a government based on the sharia . Opposing this government means opposing the sharia of Islam ... Revolt against God 's government is a revolt against God . Revolt against God is blasphemy .
