The quality of the facility - whether the hospital offers neonatal critical care services , whether it is a Level I pediatric trauma care facility , the availability of corticosteroids and other medications at the facility , the experience and number of physicians and nurses in neonatology and obstetrics and of the providers has a limited but still significant impact on fetal viability . Facilities that have obstetrical services and emergency rooms and operating facilities , even if smaller , can be used in areas where higher services are not available to stabilize the mother and fetus or neonate until they can be transferred to an appropriate facility .
