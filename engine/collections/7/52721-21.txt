The actin filament network in non-muscle cells is highly dynamic . The actin filament network is arranged with the barbed - end of each filament attached to the cell 's peripheral membrane by means of clamped - filament elongation motors , the above - mentioned `` actoclampins '' , formed from a filament barbed - end and a clamping protein ( formins , VASP , Mena , WASP , and N - WASP ) . The primary substrate for these elongation motors is profilin - actin - ATP complex which is directly transferred to elongating filament ends . The pointed - end of each filament is oriented toward the cell 's interior . In the case of lamellipodial growth , the Arp2 / 3 complex generates a branched network , and in filopodia a parallel array of filaments is formed .
