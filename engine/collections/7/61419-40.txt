Meanwhile , Yallop was busy recruiting a new coaching staff which included `` Ring of Fire '' member and Chicago Fire veteran C.J. Brown and former U.S. International striker Clint Mathis as the team 's assistant coaches , adding Columbus Crew 's Brian Bliss as Technical Director . Former Fire forward Brian McBride was added as an assistant coach in May 2014 for a short - term assignment . The shake - up extended to the roster , as Yallop moved team veterans and starters and brought in youth prospects -- reforming the team while freeing up cap space . Major exits in early 2014 included Chris Rolfe , Austin Berry , Jalil Anibaba , Daniel Paladini , and Paolo Tornaghi . Filling that void was a handful of youth prospects including Harrison Shipp ( homegrown player ) , Benji Joya ( via MLS `` weighted lottery '' ) , and Grant Ward on loan from Tottenham Hotspur . Despite rarely looking like a team that could advance to the MLS Cup Playoffs , the team once again advanced to the semifinals of the 2014 Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup , but were routed 6 -- 0 by eventual champions Seattle Sounders FC on August 13 . The result was the worst competitive defeat in club history and saw Frank Yallop issue an apology to Chicago Fire supporters on the club 's official website . As the Cup run had , the season ended in disappointment , with the Fire ending the season with a 6 -- 18 -- 10 record , with 18 draws , also setting a record for most draws in an MLS season in the process .
