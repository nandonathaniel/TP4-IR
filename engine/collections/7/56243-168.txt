Despite winning the competition , Liverpool 's place in next season 's Champions League was still in doubt . Prior to the 2005 Champions League Final , The Football Association had decided on 5 May that only the top four finishers in the Premier League would qualify and Liverpool ended their domestic season in fifth place behind Everton . UEFA initially maintained that each country could only have four Champions League spots and suggested that the FA could nominate Liverpool instead of Everton . Liverpool faced a three - week wait to discover if they would be allowed to defend their title . UEFA came to a decision on 10 June , confirming that both Everton and Liverpool would be able to compete in the Champions League ; however , Liverpool were entered into the first qualifying round , and were given no `` country protection '' ; meaning they could face another English club at any stage of the competition . The UEFA Executive Committee also amended the regulations for future competitions so that the holders would have the right to defend their title and therefore qualify automatically , though at the expense of the lowest placed team in those countries that had more than one qualifier .
