The waterway is designed for large - scale inland vessels ( 110 Ã— 11.45 m ) but it can carry much larger vessels on most of its course . The Danube has been partly canalized in Germany ( 5 locks ) and Austria ( 10 locks ) . Proposals to build a number of new locks to improve navigation have not progressed , due in part to environmental concerns .
