In 1955 , Salvador Dal√≠ painted The Sacrament of the Last Supper , with Jesus portrayed as blond and clean shaven , pointing upward to a spectral torso while the apostles are gathered around the table heads bowed so that none may be identified . It is reputed to be one of the most popular paintings in the collection of the National Gallery of Art in Washington , D.C.
