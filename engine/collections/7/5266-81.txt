The Crown Jewels include two sceptres originally made for Mary of Modena , the wife of James II , in 1685 : a gold sceptre with a cross known as the Queen Consort 's Sceptre with Cross and another topped by a dove known as the Queen Consort 's Ivory Rod with Dove , which , as the name suggests , is made of ivory . Unlike the sovereign 's dove , this one has folded wings and is relatively small . It was last used by Queen Elizabeth , later known as the Queen Mother , at the coronation of her husband George VI in 1937 . For the coronation of Mary II , the wife and joint sovereign of William III , a more elaborate gold sceptre with dove was commissioned in 1689 . It has not been used since , and went missing for several decades , only to be found in 1814 at the back of a cupboard in the Tower of London .
