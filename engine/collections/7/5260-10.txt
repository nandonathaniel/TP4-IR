The Roman Empire reached its greatest geographical extent under Trajan ( emperor 98 -- 117 ) , who ruled a prosperous state that stretched from Armenia to the Atlantic . The Empire had large numbers of trained , supplied , and disciplined soldiers , as well as a comprehensive civil administration based in thriving cities with effective control over public finances . Among its literate elite it had ideological legitimacy as the only worthwhile form of civilization and a cultural unity based on comprehensive familiarity with Greek and Roman literature and rhetoric . The Empire 's power allowed it to maintain extreme differences of wealth and status ( including slavery on a large scale ) , and its wide - ranging trade networks permitted even modest households to use goods made by professionals far away .
