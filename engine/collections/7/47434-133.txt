12 / 03 - 2 Monday , 15 May 2017 Pressure Test : Andy Bowdy 's `` Rita '' - Pete , Pia and Ray had four - and - a-half hours to recreate pastry chef Andy Bowdy 's signature twelve element intricate layered cake . The judges were impressed with Pete 's dish overall , despite him burning his second batch of candied pecans , and he was declared safe . Ray lost points in the presentation of his cake layers but was praised on the tasting apart from his thick biscuit base . Although Pia 's dish had the best presentation , her bavarois was heavy and her meringue was too grainy . In the end , the errors in Pia 's dessert outweighed Ray 's bulging cake appearance , sealing her elimination . 868,000 # 9
