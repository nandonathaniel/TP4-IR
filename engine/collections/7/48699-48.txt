The September 2004 issue was 832 pages , the largest issue of a monthly magazine ever published at that time , since exceeded by the September 2007 issue Cutler 's documentary covered . Wintour oversaw the introduction of three spinoffs : Teen Vogue , Vogue Living and Men 's Vogue . Teen Vogue has published more ad pages and earned more advertiser revenue than either Elle Girl and Cosmo Girl , and the 164 ad pages in the début issue of Men 's Vogue were the most for a first issue in Condé Nast history . AdAge named her `` Editor of the Year '' for this brand expansion .
