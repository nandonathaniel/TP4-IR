Michael observed that after he stopped wearing glasses , he began getting invited to parties . `` And the girl who did n't even see me when I was twelve invited me in , '' he noted . `` So I went out with her for a couple of months but I did n't stop seeing Helen . I thought I was being smart -- I had gone from being a total loser to being a two - timer . And I remember my sisters used to give me a hard time because they found out and they really liked the first girl . The whole idea of `` Careless Whisper '' was the first girl finding out about the second -- which she never did . But I started another relationship with a girl called Alexis without finishing the one with Jane . It all got a bit complicated . Jane found out about her and got rid of me ... The whole time I thought I was being cool , being this two - timer , but there really was n't that much emotion involved . I did feel guilty about the first girl -- and I have seen her since -- and the idea of the song was about her . `` Careless Whisper '' was us dancing , because we danced a lot , and the idea was -- we are dancing ... but she knows ... and it 's finished .
