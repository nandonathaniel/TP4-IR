In short form , the four truths are dukkha , samudaya ( `` arising , '' `` coming together '' ) , nirodha ( `` cessation , '' `` confinement '' ) , and marga , the path leading to cessation . As the `` Four Noble Truths '' ( Sanskrit : catvāri āryasatyāni ; Pali : cattāri ariyasaccāni ) , they are `` the truths of the Noble Ones , '' the truths or realities which are understood by the `` worthy ones '' who have attained nirvana .
