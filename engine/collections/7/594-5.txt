Auburn 's Bo Jackson claims to have run a 40 - yard dash with a time of 4.13 s . A time of 4.18 run by Jackson within the same week added some support to the legitimacy of the times . Texas Tech 's Jakeem Grant was hand - timed by a New Orleans Saints scout as running a 4.10 in 2016 , potentially beating Jackson 's record . Deion Sanders ran a 4.27 - second 40 - yard dash in 1989 .
