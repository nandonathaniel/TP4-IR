Although education in Canada was made the jurisdiction of the provincial governments by the British North America Act , Indigenous peoples and their treaties were under the jurisdiction of the federal government . Residential schools were funded under the Indian Act by what was then the federal Department of the Interior . Adopted in 1876 as An Act to amend and consolidate the laws respecting Indians , it consolidated all previous laws placing Indigenous communities , land and finances under federal control . As explained by the TRC , the Act `` made Indians wards of the state , unable to vote in provincial or federal elections or enter the professions if they did not surrender their status , and severely limited their freedom to participate in spiritual and cultural practices '' .
