The temperate rainforests of South Africa are part of the Knysna - Amatole forests that are located along South Africa 's Garden Route between Cape Town and Durban on the south - facing slopes of South Africa 's Drakensberg Mountains facing the Indian Ocean . There are several coniferous podocarps that grow here . This forest receives a lot of moisture as fog from the Indian Ocean , and resembles not only other temperate rain forests worldwide , but also the montane evergreen Afromontane forests that occur at higher elevations in southern and eastern Africa . A fine example of this forest is in South Africa 's Tsitsikamma National Park .
