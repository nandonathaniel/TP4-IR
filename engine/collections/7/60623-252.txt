The Russian Empire was , predominantly , a rural society spread over vast spaces . In 1913 , 80 % of the people were peasants . Soviet historiography proclaimed that the Russian Empire of the 19th century was characterized by systemic crisis , which impoverished the workers and peasants and culminated in the revolutions of the early 20th century . Recent research by Russian scholars disputes this interpretation . Mironov assesses the effects of the reforms of latter 19th - century especially in terms of the 1861 emancipation of the serfs , agricultural output trends , various standard of living indicators , and taxation of peasants . He argues that they brought about measurable improvements in social welfare . More generally , he finds that the well - being of the Russian people declined during most of the 18th century , but increased slowly from the end of the 18th century to 1914 .
