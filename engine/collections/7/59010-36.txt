The surviving padapatha version of the Rigveda text is ascribed to Śākalya . The Śākala recension has 1,017 regular hymns , and an appendix of 11 vālakhilya hymns which are now customarily included in the 8th mandala ( as 8.49 -- 8.59 ) , for a total of 1028 hymns . The Bāṣkala recension includes 8 of these vālakhilya hymns among its regular hymns , making a total of 1025 regular hymns for this śākhā . In addition , the Bāṣkala recension has its own appendix of 98 hymns , the Khilani .
