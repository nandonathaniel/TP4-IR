Benioff and Weiss spoke about the end of the show , saying , `` From the beginning we 've wanted to tell a 70 - hour movie . It will turn out to be a 73 - hour movie , but it 's stayed relatively the same of having the beginning , middle and now we 're coming to the end . It would have been really tough if we lost any core cast members along the way , I 'm very happy we 've kept everyone and we get to finish it the way we want to . '' The season is set to air in 2019 .
