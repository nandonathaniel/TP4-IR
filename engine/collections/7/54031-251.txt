As a part of the morning prayer services on certain days of the week , fast days , and holidays , as well as part of the afternoon prayer services of Shabbat , Yom Kippur , and fast days , a section of the Pentateuch is read from a Torah scroll . On Shabbat ( Saturday ) mornings , a weekly section ( `` parashah '' ) is read , selected so that the entire Pentateuch is read consecutively each year . The division of parashot found in the modern - day Torah scrolls of all Jewish communities ( Ashkenazic , Sephardic , and Yemenite ) is based upon the systematic list provided by Maimonides in Mishneh Torah , Laws of Tefillin , Mezuzah and Torah Scrolls , chapter 8 . Maimonides based his division of the parashot for the Torah on the Aleppo Codex . Conservative and Reform synagogues may read parashot on a triennial rather than annual schedule , On Saturday afternoons , Mondays , and Thursdays , the beginning of the following Saturday 's portion is read . On Jewish holidays , the beginnings of each month , and fast days , special sections connected to the day are read .
