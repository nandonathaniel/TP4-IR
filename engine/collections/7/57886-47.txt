The vessels that deliver oxygen - rich blood to the myocardium are the coronary arteries . When the arteries are healthy , they are capable of autoregulating themselves to maintain the coronary blood flow at levels appropriate to the needs of the heart muscle . These relatively narrow vessels are commonly affected by atherosclerosis and can become blocked , causing angina or a heart attack . The coronary arteries that run deep within the myocardium are referred to as subendocardial . The coronary arteries are classified as `` end circulation '' , since they represent the only source of blood supply to the myocardium ; there is very little redundant blood supply , that is why blockage of these vessels can be so critical .
