An all - new clean sheet redesign of General Motors ' Chevrolet and GMC brand C / K - Series pickups d√©buted in mid-1972 for the 1973 model year . Development of the new third - generation trucks began in 1968 with vehicle components undergoing simulated testing on computers before the first prototype pickups were even built for real world testing . The redesign was revolutionary in appearance at the time , particularly the cab , departing from typical American pickup truck designs of the era . Aside from being near twins , the Chevrolet and GMC pickups looked like nothing else on the road . The third - generation trucks are colloquially known as the `` Square - body '' or `` Box - body '' generation . GM 's official `` Rounded - Line '' moniker highlighted the pickup 's rounded styling cues that were incorporated into the design . This included rounded windshield corners , rounded corners of the cab roof , rounded - corner doors which cut high into the cab roof eliminating roof height , slanted front fenders , and rounded pickup box corners which allowed for rounded wraparound taillamps , a first for GM pickups . The design also featured strong distinctive curved shoulderlines which rounded out below the beltline . The curved shoulderline continued across the back tailgate on Chevrolet Fleetside and GMC Wideside models . However , the low slope of the hood and rectangular front end of the truck originated the `` square / box - body '' nickname , which was propagated through truck magazines and word of mouth .
