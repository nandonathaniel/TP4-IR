A totally stubby area is similar to a stub area . However , this area does not allow summary routes in addition to not having external routes , that is , inter-area ( IA ) routes are not summarized into totally stubby areas . The only way for traffic to get routed outside the area is a default route which is the only Type - 3 LSA advertised into the area . When there is only one route out of the area , fewer routing decisions have to be made by the route processor , which lowers system resource utilization .
