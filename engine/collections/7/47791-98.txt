Several National Reconnaissance Office ( NRO ) satellites that only the shuttle could launch were grounded because of the accident , a dilemma NRO had feared since the 1970s when the shuttle was designated as the United States ' primary launch system for all government and commercial payloads . NASA had difficulties with its own Titan rocket and Delta rocket programs , due to other unexpected rocket failures occurring before and after the Challenger disaster . On August 28 , 1985 , a Titan 34D carrying a KH - 11 Kennan satellite exploded after liftoff over Vandenberg Air Force Base , when the first stage propellant feed system failed . It was the first failure of a Titan missile since 1978 . On April 18 , 1986 , another Titan 34D - 9 carrying a classified payload , said to be a Big Bird spy satellite , exploded at about 830 feet above the pad after liftoff over Vandenberg AFB , when a burnthrough occurred on one of the rocket boosters . On May 3 , 1986 , a Delta 3914 carrying the GOES - G weather satellite exploded 71 seconds after liftoff over Cape Canaveral Air Force Station due to an electrical malfunction on the Delta 's first stage , which prompted the range safety officer on the ground to decide to destroy the rocket , just as a few of the rocket 's boosters were jettisoned . As a result of these three failures , NASA decided to cancel all Titan and Delta launches from Cape Canaveral and Vandenberg for four months until the problem in the rockets ' designs were solved .
