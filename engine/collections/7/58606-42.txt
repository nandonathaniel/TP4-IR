The Boy Scouts of America celebrated their fortieth anniversary in 1950 with the theme of `` Strengthen the Arm of Liberty '' . Between 1949 and 1952 , approximately two hundred 100 - inch ( 2.5 m ) replicas of the statue , made of stamped copper , were purchased by Boy Scout troops and donated in 39 states in the U.S. and several of its possessions and territories . The project was the brainchild of Kansas City businessman J.P. Whitaker , who was then Scout Commissioner of the Kansas City Area Council . The copper statues were manufactured by Friedley - Voshardt Co . ( Chicago , Illinois ) and purchased through the Kansas City Boy Scout office by those wanting one . The statues are approximately 8 ‚ÅÑ feet ( 2.6 m ) tall without the base , are constructed of sheet copper , weigh 290 pounds ( 130 kg ) , and originally cost $350 plus freight . The mass - produced statues are not great art nor meticulously accurate ( a conservator notes that `` her face is n't as mature as the real Liberty . It 's rounder and more like a little girl 's '' ) , but they are cherished , particularly since 9 / 11 . Many have been lost or destroyed , but preservationists have been able to account for about a hundred of them , and BSA Troop 101 of Cheyenne , Wyoming , has collected photographs of over 100 of them . They are commonly installed at city halls , libraries , and schools . One of these statues was sent to the Philippines . After some years at the mouth of the Pasig River , Manila , it was kept in a store room at the Scout Reservation , Makiling , Laguna , for about two decades . It is now stored at the national office of the Boy Scouts of the Philippines , Manila .
