Spain is a unitary state with a high level of decentralisation , often regarded as a federal system in all but name or a `` federation without federalism '' . The country has been quoted as being `` an extraordinarily decentralized country '' , with the central government accounting for just 18 % of public spending , 38 % for the regional governments , 13 % for the local councils , and the remaining 31 % for the social security system . The current Spanish constitution has been implemented in such a way that , in many respects , Spain can be compared to countries which are undeniably federal .
