`` The Last Day '' is filmed from the first - person perspective of a Gallifreyan soldier who has had a camera implanted in his head . The soldiers scan for Daleks at Arcadia , Gallifrey 's second city and believed due to its impregnable defences to be the safest place on the Time Lords ' home planet . During training exercises , a blurred object in the sky is identified shockingly as the first of a fleet of successfully invading Daleks , which kill the soldiers . The `` Fall of Arcadia '' becomes the central battle of the Time War around which `` The Day of the Doctor '' is centred .
