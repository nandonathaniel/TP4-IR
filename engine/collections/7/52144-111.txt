In 1997 , the record company RCA Victor released a definitive two - CD set to accompany the publications of all three of the Special Editions of the films of the Star Wars Trilogy . This original limited - edition set of CDs featured a 32 - page black booklet that was enclosed within a protective outer slip - case . The covers of the booklet and of the slip - case have selections from the poster art of the Star Wars Trilogy : Special Edition . All of the tracks have been digitally re-mastered supposedly for superior clarity of sound .
