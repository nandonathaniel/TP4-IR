Allegations of corruption in the bidding processes for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups caused threats from England 's FA to boycott the tournament . FIFA appointed Michael J. Garcia , a US attorney , to investigate and produce a report on the corruption allegations . Although the report was never published , FIFA released a 42 - page summary of its findings as determined by German judge Hans - Joachim Eckert . Eckert 's summary cleared Russia and Qatar of any wrongdoing , but was denounced by critics as a whitewash . Garcia criticised the summary as being `` materially incomplete '' with `` erroneous representations of the facts and conclusions '' , and appealed to FIFA 's Appeal Committee . The committee declined to hear his appeal , so Garcia resigned in protest of FIFA 's conduct , citing a `` lack of leadership '' and lack of confidence in the independence of Eckert .
