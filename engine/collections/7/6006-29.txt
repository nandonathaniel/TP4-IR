Aphids are the predominant means by which PRSV is transmitted . PRSV is a non-persistent virus , meaning it does not enter beyond the feeding mouthparts of the aphid , and does not circulate or multiply within its insect host . Non-persistent viruses are transmitted quickly and easily between plants . Many species of aphid can transmit PRSV , particularly the Peach Aphid and Melon Aphid .
