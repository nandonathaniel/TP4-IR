In the National Football League ( NFL ) , the franchise tag is a designation a team may apply to a player scheduled to become an unrestricted free agent . The tag binds the player to the team for one year if certain conditions are met . Each team only has one franchise tag ( of either the exclusive or non-exclusive forms ) and one transition tag per year . The transition tag can only be used if the team does not use a franchise tag .
