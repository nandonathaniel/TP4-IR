The work was abandoned when the tyranny was overthrown and Hippias was expelled in 510 BC . Only the platform and some elements of the columns had been completed by this point , and the temple remained in this state for 336 years .

In the treatise Politics , Aristotle cited the temple as an example of how tyrannies engaged the populace in great works for the state ( like a white elephant ) and left them no time , energy or means to rebel .
