The Commitments is the first book in Doyle 's series known as The Barrytown Trilogy , followed by The Snapper ( 1990 ) and The Van ( 1991 ) . While all three novels focus on the Rabbitte family , Doyle expressed that he was not interested in writing or producing sequels to the 1991 film adaptation , stating , `` I hope it 's never made . I just think that , whereas The Commitments was very much a labour of love , Commitments 2 is definitely an act of cynicism . ''
