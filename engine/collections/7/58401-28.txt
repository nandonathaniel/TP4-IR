After many lessons ; the relationship between Sun and Jae Lee developed into an affair . The two were eventually found in bed together by Mr. Paik and the affair ended . Sun and Jin had been trying to conceive a child , but after visiting a fertility doctor , they were informed that Sun was unable to conceive due to severe endometriosis , causing more strain on the marriage . Later , however , the doctor confided in Sun that it was Jin who was infertile , and that he was afraid to tell him because of his job as an enforcer . Later , Sun learned of Jae Lee 's death and attended his funeral . She asked her father if he would tell Jin about her affair , to which he declined , saying that it was not his place . During preparations for a business trip , with Jin , to Sydney and Los Angeles ; Sun spoke privately with a woman acting as an interior decorator . Sun had planned to leave Jin and her family and the woman had helped Sun set up a false identity ( and a place for her to hide until the search for her ended ) . She was given instructions to leave Jin at the Sydney airport at 11 : 15 precisely ; a car would be waiting outside the Oceanic Airlines gate and she was to maintain a low profile .
