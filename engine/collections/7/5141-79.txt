Gamaliel VI ( 400 -- 425 ) was the Sanhedrin 's last president . With his death in 425 , Theodosius II outlawed the title of Nasi , the last remains of the ancient Sanhedrin . An imperial decree of 426 diverted the patriarchs ' tax ( post excessum patriarchorum ) into the imperial treasury . The exact reason for the abrogation of the patriarchate is not clear , though Gamaliel VI , the last holder of the office who had been for a time elevated by the emperor to the rank of prefect , may have fallen out with the imperial authorities . Thereafter , Jews were gradually excluded from holding public office .
