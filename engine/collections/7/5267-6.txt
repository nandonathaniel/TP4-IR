Movies : While some color film processes ( including hand coloring ) were experimented with and in limited use from the earliest days of motion pictures , the switch from most films being in black - and - white to most being in color was gradual , taking place from the 1930s to the 1960s . Even when most film studios had the capability to make color films , the technology 's popularity was limited , as using the Technicolor process was expensive and the process cumbersome . For many years , it was not possible for films in color to render realistic hues , thus its use was restricted to historical films or musicals until the 1950s , while many directors preferred to use black - and - white stock . For the years 1940 -- 1966 , a separate Academy Award for Best Art Direction was given for black - and - white movies along with one for color .
