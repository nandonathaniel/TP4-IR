The Hindu scripture Shiva Purana describes the origin of the lingam , known as Shiva - linga , as the beginning-less and endless cosmic pillar ( Stambha ) of fire , the cause of all causes . Lord Shiva is pictured as emerging from the Lingam -- the cosmic pillar of fire -- proving his superiority over the gods Brahma and Vishnu . This is known as Lingodbhava . The Linga Purana also supports this interpretation of lingam as a cosmic pillar , symbolizing the infinite nature of Shiva . According to the Linga Purana , the lingam is a complete symbolic representation of the formless Universe Bearer -- the oval - shaped stone is the symbol of the Universe , and the bottom base represents the Supreme Power that holds the entire Universe in it . A similar interpretation is also found in the Skanda Purana : `` The endless sky ( that great void which contains the entire universe ) is the Linga , the Earth is its base . At the end of time the entire universe and all the Gods finally merge in the Linga itself . '' In yogic lore , the linga is considered the first form to arise when creation occurs , and also the last form before the dissolution of creation . It is therefore seen as an access to Shiva or that which lies beyond physical creation . In the Mahabharata , at the end of Dwaraka Yuga , Lord Shiva says to his disciples that in the coming Kali Yuga , He would not appear in any particular form , but instead as the formless and omnipresent .
