After months of negotiations between the team , local Alderman Tom Tunney , and Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel , the plan obtained the endorsements of both the city 's Landmarks Commission and Plan Commission before receiving final approval by the Chicago City Council in July 2013 . To help fund the project , the team planned to more than double the amount of advertising signage in and around the stadium to about 51,000 square feet , including additional signage to be placed beyond the outfield walls -- a move that was opposed by many owners of the rooftop clubs that surround the stadium who worried that such signage would obstruct their sightlines . Before work on the project began , the team wanted the rooftop owners to agree not to pursue legal action challenging the construction and continued to negotiate privately with them -- offering to reduce the size and number of signs to be built -- in order to gain their assent . The team could not come to terms with the rooftop owners who had a lease agreement with the team until 2023 in exchange for paying 17 % of the gross revenues . In May 2014 the Cubs announced they would pursue the original 2013 plan to modify the park . Over the course of the next three years , the Ricketts family began to purchase many of the rooftop locations .
