On December 1 , 1978 , at about 11 p.m. , Sadler killed a country music songwriter named Lee Emerson Bellamy with one gunshot to the head . The shooting was the culmination of a month - long dispute the men had concerning Darlene Sharpe , who was Bellamy 's former girlfriend , and Sadler 's lover at the time . Bellamy made many harassing telephone calls to Sadler and Sharpe , had one violent confrontation in a Nashville bar 's parking lot , and threatened both their lives .
