Jorge Moll and Jordan Grafman , neuroscientists at the National Institutes of Health and LABS - D'Or Hospital Network ( J.M. ) provided the first evidence for the neural bases of altruistic giving in normal healthy volunteers , using functional magnetic resonance imaging . In their research , published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA in October 2006 , they showed that both pure monetary rewards and charitable donations activated the mesolimbic reward pathway , a primitive part of the brain that usually responds to food and sex . However , when volunteers generously placed the interests of others before their own by making charitable donations , another brain circuit was selectively activated : the subgenual cortex / septal region . These structures are intimately related to social attachment and bonding in other species . Altruism , the experiment suggested , was not a superior moral faculty that suppresses basic selfish urges but rather was basic to the brain , hard - wired and pleasurable . One brain region , the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex / basal forebrain , contributes to learning altruistic behavior , especially in those with trait empathy . The same study has shown a connection between giving to charity and the promotion of social bonding .
