Contrary to many film versions , the creature in the novel is very articulate and eloquent in his way of speaking . Almost immediately after his creation , he dresses himself ; and within 11 months , he can speak and read German and French . By the end of the novel , the creature appears able to speak English fluently as well . The Van Helsing and Penny Dreadful interpretations of the character have similar personalities to the literary original , although the latter version is the only one to retain the character 's violent reactions to rejection .
