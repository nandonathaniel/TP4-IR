Abrahams and Liddell did race against each other once , but not quite as depicted in the film , which shows Liddell winning the final of the 100 yards against a shattered Abrahams at the 1923 AAA Championship at Stamford Bridge . In fact , they raced only in a heat of the 220 yards , which Liddell won , five yards ahead of Abrahams , who did not progress to the final . In the 100 yards , Abrahams was eliminated in the heats and never raced against Liddell , who won the finals of both races the next day .
