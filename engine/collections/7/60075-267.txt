UK laws on defamation are among the strictest in the western world , imposing a high burden of proof on the defendant . However , the Education ( No. 2 ) Act 1986 guarantees freedom of speech ( within institutions of further education and institutions of higher education ) as long as it is within the law ( see section 43 of the Education ( No. 2 ) Act 1986 ) . UK defamation law may have experienced a considerable liberalising effect as a result of the ruling in Jameel v Wall Street Journal in October 2006 . A ruling of the House of Lords -- the then highest court of appeal -- revived the so - called Reynolds Defence , in which journalism undertaken in the public interest shall enjoy a complete defence against a libel suit . Conditions for the defence include the right of reply for potential claimants , and that the balance of the piece was fair in view of what the writer knew at the time . The ruling removed the awkward -- and hitherto binding -- conditions of being able to describe the publisher as being under a duty to publish the material and the public as having a definite interest in receiving it . The original House of Lords judgment in Reynolds was unclear and held 3 -- 2 ; whereas Jameel was unanimous and resounding . Lord Hoffman 's words , in particular , for how the judge at first instance had applied Reynolds so narrowly , were very harsh . Hoffman LJ made seven references to Eady J , none of them favorable . He twice described his thinking as unrealistic and compared his language to `` the jargon of the old Soviet Union . '' The Defamation Act 2013 reformed English defamation law on issues of the right to freedom of expression and the protection of reputation , and abolished the Reynolds Defence , Reynolds v Times Newspapers Ltd , also replacing the common law defences of justification and fair comment .
