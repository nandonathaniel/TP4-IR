The flow of reparations from Germany played a central role in strengthening French finances . The government began a large - scale reconstruction program to repair wartime damages , and was burdened with a very large public debt . Taxation policies were inefficient , with widespread evasion , and when the financial crisis grew worse in 1926 , Poincar√© levied new taxes , reformed the system of tax collection , and drastically reduced government spending to balance the budget and stabilize the franc . Holders of the national debt lost 80 % of the face value of their bonds , but runaway inflation did not occur . From 1926 to 1929 , the French economy prospered and manufacturing flourished .
