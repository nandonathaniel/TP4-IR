Iron metal is singularly scarce in collections of Egyptian antiquities . Bronze remained the primary material there until the conquest by Neo-Assyrian Empire in 671 BC . The explanation of this would seem to lie in the fact that the relics are in most cases the paraphernalia of tombs , the funeral vessels and vases , and iron being considered an impure metal by the ancient Egyptians it was never used in their manufacture of these or for any religious purposes . It was attributed to Seth , the spirit of evil who according to Egyptian tradition governed the central deserts of Africa .
