The Dead Un-Dead was one of Stoker 's original titles for Dracula , and the manuscript was entitled simply The Un-Dead up until a few weeks before publication . Stoker 's notes for Dracula show that the name of the count was originally `` Count Wampyr '' , but Stoker became intrigued by the name `` Dracula '' while doing research , after reading William Wilkinson 's book An Account of the Principalities of Wallachia and Moldavia with Political Observations Relative to Them ( London 1820 ) , which he found in the Whitby Library and consulted a number of times during visits to Whitby in the 1890s . The name Dracula was the patronym ( DrÄƒculea ) of the descendants of Vlad II of Wallachia , who took the name `` Dracul '' after being invested in the Order of the Dragon in 1431 . In the Old Romanian language , the word dracul ( Romanian drac `` dragon '' + - ul `` the '' ) meant `` the dragon '' and Dracula meant `` son of the dragon '' . In the present day however , dracul means `` the devil '' .
