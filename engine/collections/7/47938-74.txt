Unlevered free cash flow ( i.e. , cash flows before interest payments ) is defined as EBITDA - CAPEX - changes in net working capital - taxes . This is the generally accepted definition . If there are mandatory repayments of debt , then some analysts utilize levered free cash flow , which is the same formula above , but less interest and mandatory principal repayments . The unlevered cash flow ( UFCF ) is usually used as the industry norm , because it allows for easier comparison of different companies ' cash flows . It is also preferred over the levered cash flow when conducting analyses to test the impact of different capital structures on the company .
