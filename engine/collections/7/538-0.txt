A production -- possibility frontier ( PPF ) or production possibility curve ( PPC ) is a graphical representation of possible combinations of two goods ( such as butter and guns ) that can be produced with constant technology and resources per unit of time , such that more of one good could be produced only by diverting resources from the other good , resulting in less production of it ; i.e. production tradeoffs , usually for an economy , but which can also be interpreted as applying for an individual , household , etc .
