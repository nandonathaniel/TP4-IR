Cys282Tyr ( or C282Y ) is a mutation in the HFE gene that has been linked to most cases of hereditary hemochromatosis . Genetic techniques indicate that this mutation occurred roughly 60 -- 70 generations ago or between 600 and 800 CE , assuming a generation length of 20 years . The regional distribution of this mutation among European populations indicates that it originated in Southern Scandinavia and spread with Viking expansion . Due to the timing of the mutation and subsequent population movements , C282Y is very prominent in Great Britain , Normandy , and Southern Scandinavia although C282Y has been found in almost every population that has been in contact with the Vikings .
