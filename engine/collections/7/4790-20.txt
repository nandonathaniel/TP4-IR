Meanwhile , a young orphan named Quinn ( Kaitlyn Maher ) arrives at a foster home run by a strict and no - nonsense woman named Ms. Stout ( Wendi McLendon - Covey ) who does not approve of anything that children love : toys , Christmas decorations , singing , and even pets . She has a furnace which she uses to burn all the toys which she confiscates from the girls who rightfully own them . Despite the strict rules she has to respect while staying at the foster home , Quinn eventually befriends the girls , including Janie ( G. Hannelius ) and Willamina `` Will '' ( Madison Pettis ) Who has lost her love of the holiday after the death of her parents years ago .
