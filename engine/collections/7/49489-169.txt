Later that summer , the Russians under Field Marshal Stepan Fyodorovich Apraksin besieged Memel with 75,000 troops . Memel had one of the strongest fortresses in Prussia . However , after five days of artillery bombardment the Russian army was able to storm it . The Russians then used Memel as a base to invade East Prussia and defeated a smaller Prussian force in the fiercely contested Battle of Gross - Jägersdorf on 30 August 1757 . In the words of the American historian Daniel Marston , Gross - Jägersdorf left the Prussians with `` a newfound respect for the fighting capabilities of the Russians that was reinforced in the later battles of Zorndorf and Kunersdorf '' . However , the Russians were not yet able to take Königsberg after using up their supplies of cannonballs at Memel and Gross - Jägersdorf and retreated soon afterwards .
