Barton then came up with another design , which the committee submitted back to Congress on May 9 , 1782 , just five days after being formed . This time , the figures on each side of the shield were the `` Genius of the American Confederated Republic '' represented by a maiden , and on the other side an American warrior . At the top is an eagle and on the pillar in the shield is a `` Phoenix in Flames '' . The mottos were In Vindiciam Libertatis ( In Defense of Liberty ) and Virtus sola invicta ( Only virtue unconquered ) .
