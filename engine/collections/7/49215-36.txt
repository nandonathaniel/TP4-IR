By the end of the 1920s , Desgrange believed he could not beat what he believed were the underhand tactics of bike factories . When the Alcyon team contrived to get Maurice De Waele to win even though he was sick , he said `` My race has been won by a corpse '' . In 1930 Desgrange again attempted to take control of the Tour from teams , insisting competitors enter in national teams rather than trade teams and that competitors ride plain yellow bicycles that he would provide , without a maker 's name . There was no place for individuals in the post-1930s teams and so Desgrange created regional teams , generally from France , to take in riders who would not otherwise have qualified . The original touriste - routiers mostly disappeared but some were absorbed into regional teams . In 1936 Desgrange had a prostate operation . At the time , two operations were needed ; the Tour de France was due to fall between them . Desgrange persuaded his surgeon to let him follow the race . The second day proved too much and , in a fever at Charleville , he retired to his ch√¢teau at Beauvallon . Desgrange died at home on the Mediterranean coast on 16 August 1940 . The race was taken over by his deputy , Jacques Goddet . The Tour was again disrupted by War after 1939 , and did not return until 1947 .
