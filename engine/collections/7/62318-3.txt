The oldest operation for which evidence exists is trepanation ( also known as trepanning , trephination , trephining or burr hole from Greek τρύπανον and τρυπανισμός ) , in which a hole is drilled or scraped into the skull for exposing the dura mater to treat health problems related to intracranial pressure and other diseases . In the case of head wounds , surgical intervention was implemented for investigating and diagnosing the nature of the wound and the extent of the impact while bone splinters were removed preferably by scraping followed by post operation procedures and treatments for avoiding infection and aiding in the healing process . Evidence has been found in prehistoric human remains from Proto - Neolithic and Neolithic times , in cave paintings , and the procedure continued in use well into recorded history ( being described by ancient Greek writers such as Hippocrates ) . Out of 120 prehistoric skulls found at one burial site in France dated to 6500 BCE , 40 had trepanation holes . Folke Henschen , a Swedish doctor and historian , asserts that Soviet excavations of the banks of the Dnieper River in the 1970s show the existence of trepanation in Mesolithic times dated to approximately 12000 BCE . The remains suggest a belief that trepanning could cure epileptic seizures , migraines , and certain mental disorders .
