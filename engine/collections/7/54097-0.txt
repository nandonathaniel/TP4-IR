The Public Land Survey System ( PLSS ) is the surveying method developed and used in the United States to plat , or divide , real property for sale and settling . Also known as the Rectangular Survey System , it was created by the Land Ordinance of 1785 to survey land ceded to the United States by the Treaty of Paris in 1783 , following the end of the American Revolution . Beginning with the Seven Ranges , in present - day Ohio , the PLSS has been used as the primary survey method in the United States . Following the passage of the Northwest Ordinance , in 1787 , the Surveyor General of the Northwest Territory platted lands in the Northwest Territory . The Surveyor General was later merged with the General Land Office , which later became a part of the U.S. Bureau of Land Management ( BLM ) . Today , the BLM controls the survey , sale , and settling of the new lands , and manages the State Plane Coordinate System .
