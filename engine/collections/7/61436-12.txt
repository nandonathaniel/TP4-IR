The People 's Party , also known as the Populist Party or the Populists , was an agrarian - populist political party in the United States . For a few years , 1892 -- 96 , it played a major role as a left - wing force in American politics . It was merged into the Democratic Party in 1896 ; a small independent remnant survived until 1908 . It drew support from angry farmers in the West and South . It was highly critical of banks and railroads , and allied itself with the labor movement .
