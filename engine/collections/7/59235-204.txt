Scientists debate whether the Amazon or the Nile is the longest river in the world . Traditionally , the Nile is considered longer , but recent information suggests that the Amazon may be longer . Differences in the recorded length of the Amazon mainly depend on whether or not it is valid to take a course south of the Ilha de Marajó at the Amazon 's mouth . New evidence , ( dated 16 June 2007 ) obtained from a high - altitude scientific venture in the Andes , claims that `` the Amazon is longer than the Nile by 100km , with its longest headwater being the Carhuasanta stream originating in the south of Peru on the Nevado Mismi mountain 's northern slopes and flowing into the Río Apurímac '' . However , the origin of the river at Nevado Mismi had already been known more than one decade earlier ( see Jacek Palkiewicz ) , and satellite based measuring from this origin to the Amazon mouth has resulted in not more than 6,400 km .
