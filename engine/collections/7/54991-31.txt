In a later address before Congress , the president declared , `` As a symbol of America 's resolve , my administration will work with Congress , and these two leaders , to show the world that we will rebuild New York City . '' The immediate response from World Trade Center leaseholder Larry Silverstein was that `` it would be the tragedy of tragedies not to rebuild this part of New York . It would give the terrorists the victory they seek . '' However , in 2011 , only one building , 7 World Trade Center , had been rebuilt . The buildings that have been rebuilt so far include 7 World Trade Center , One World Trade Center , and 4 World Trade Center . The original twin towers took less than three years from start of construction to be finished and five years from the beginning planning stages . However , given the complexity and highly political nature of the rebuilding efforts , they are often cited as an example of a successful public - private collaboration and are taught as a case study in successful negotiations .
