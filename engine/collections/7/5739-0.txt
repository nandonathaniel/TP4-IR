The history of Linux began in 1991 with the commencement of a personal project by Finnish student Linus Torvalds to create a new free operating system kernel . Since then , the resulting Linux kernel has been marked by constant growth throughout its history . Since the initial release of its source code in 1991 , it has grown from a small number of C files under a license prohibiting commercial distribution to the 4.2. 3 version in 2015 with more than 18 million lines of source code under the GNU General Public License v2 .
