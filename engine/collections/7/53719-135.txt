In 1646 , a series of five naval actions known as the Battles of La Naval de Manila was fought between the forces of Spain and the Dutch Republic , as part of the Eighty Years ' War . Although the Spanish forces consisted of just two Manila galleons and a galley with crews composed mainly of Filipino volunteers , against three separate Dutch squadrons , totaling eighteen ships , the Dutch squadrons were severely defeated in all fronts by the Spanish - Filipino forces , forcing the Dutch to abandon their plans for an invasion of the Philippines .
