Display : The Explorer version of Google Glass uses a liquid crystal on silicon ( LCoS ) ( based on an LCoS chip from Himax ) , field - sequential color system , LED illuminated display . The display 's LED illumination is first P - polarized and then shines through the in - coupling polarizing beam splitter ( PBS ) to the LCoS panel . The panel reflects the light and alters it to S - polarization at active pixel sensor sites . The in - coupling PBS then reflects the S - polarized areas of light at 45 ° through the out - coupling beam splitter to a collimating reflector at the other end . Finally , the out - coupling beam splitter ( which is a partially reflecting mirror , not a polarizing beam splitter ) reflects the collimated light another 45 ° and into the wearer 's eye .
