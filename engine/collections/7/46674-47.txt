Classroom instructions are given in each of the seven `` Army Core Values '' , which include loyalty , duty , respect , selfless service , honor , integrity and personal courage ( meant to spell out the mnemonic LDRSHIP , or `` leadership '' ) . There are also classes held on subjects that involve day - to - day personal life in the Army , such as sexual harassment awareness / prevention and race relations .
