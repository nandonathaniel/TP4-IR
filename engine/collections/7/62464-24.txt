In the mid-1980s , McDonald 's , like other traditional employers of teenagers , was faced with a shortage of labor in the United States . The company met this challenge by being the first to entice retirees back into the workforce . Focusing on off - site training , it opened its Hamburger University in 1961 to train franchisees and corporate decision - makers . By 1990 , more than 40,000 people had received `` Bachelor of Hamburgerology '' degrees from the 80 - acre ( 320,000 m ) Oak Brook , Illinois , facility . The corporation opened a Hamburger University in Tokyo in 1971 , in Munich in 1975 , and in London in 1982 .
