The Saint agreed . Within a few hours of appointment , he shot his way through the county sheriff 's department and was hot on Custer 's trail . He eventually found Jesse in a small motel , but both of his guns were stayed by Jesse 's voice . This marked the first time that the Saint of Killers was held back from his mission , and a target was allowed to flee . Apart from that , the angel revealed that God , the only power in the Universe that could command the Saint , abandoned Heaven . He let the Preacher go , but vowed to track him down .
