Neil Gaiman 's comic series The Sandman uses the play as a focal point in issue No. 19 . In it , Shakespeare and his company perform the play for the real Oberon and Titania and an audience of fairies . The play is heavily quoted in the comic . Shakespeare 's son Hamnet Shakespeare appears in the play as the Indian boy . It is strongly hinted that he is later taken away by Titania , much like the changeling in the story . This issue was the first and only comic to win the World Fantasy Award for Best Short Fiction , in 1991 .
