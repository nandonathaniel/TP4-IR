Between the 2 : 3 and 1 : 2 resonances with Neptune , at approximately 42 -- 48 AU , the gravitational interactions with Neptune occur over an extended timescale , and objects can exist with their orbits essentially unaltered . This region is known as the classical Kuiper belt , and its members comprise roughly two thirds of KBOs observed to date . Because the first modern KBO discovered , ( 15760 ) 1992 QB 1 , is considered the prototype of this group , classical KBOs are often referred to as cubewanos ( `` Q-B - 1 - os '' ) . The guidelines established by the IAU demand that classical KBOs be given names of mythological beings associated with creation .
