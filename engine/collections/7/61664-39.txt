President Bush appointed Michael D. Brown as FEMA 's director in January 2003 . Brown warned in September 2003 that FEMA 's absorption into DHS would make a mockery of FEMA 's new motto , `` A Nation Prepared '' , and would `` fundamentally sever FEMA from its core functions '' , `` shatter agency morale '' and `` break longstanding , effective and tested relationships with states and first responder stakeholders '' . The inevitable result of the reorganization of 2003 , warned Brown , would be `` an ineffective and uncoordinated response '' to a terrorist attack or a natural disaster .
