Between c. 1119 -- c. 1125 , Gerard ( Latin : Girardus ) , the Prior of the Holy Sepulchre , along with Warmund , Patriarch of Jerusalem , wrote an important letter to Diego Gelm√≠rez , Archbiship of Santiago de Compostela citing crop failures and being threatened by their enemies ; they requested food , money , and military aid in order to maintain the Kingdom of Jerusalem . Gerard consequently participated among others in the Council of Nablus , 16 January 1120 . In it , Canons 20 -- 21 deal with clerics . Canon 20 says a cleric should not be held guilty if he takes up arms in self - defense , but he can not take up arms for any other reason nor can he act like a knight . This was an important concern for the crusader states ; clerics were generally forbidden from participating in warfare in European law , but the Crusaders needed all the manpower they could find , and only one year before , Antioch had been defended by the Latin Patriarch of Antioch following the Battle of Ager Sanguinis , one of the calamities referred to in the introduction to the canons . Canon 21 says that a monk or canon regular who apostatizes should either return to his order or go into exile .
