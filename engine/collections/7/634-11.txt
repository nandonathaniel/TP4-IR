The Constitution was adopted by the Indian Constituent Assembly on 26 November 1949 , and came into effect on 26 January 1950 with a democratic government system , completing the country 's transition towards becoming an independent republic . 26 January was chosen as the Republic day because it was on this day in 1930 when Declaration of Indian Independence ( Purna Swaraj ) was proclaimed by the Indian National Congress as opposed to the Dominion status offered by British Regime .
