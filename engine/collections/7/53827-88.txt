Two official versions of the video were produced , the first of which now appears on Madonna 's greatest - hits DVD compilation , Celebration , and was released as the official video worldwide . The second version was issued along with the `` Humpty Remix '' , a more upbeat and dance - friendly version of the song . This video was aired on MTV 's dance channel in the United States to promote the film The Next Best Thing , starring Madonna and Rupert Everett ; it contains totally different footage and new outtakes of the original and omits the lesbian kiss . Everett , who provides backing vocals in the song , is also featured in the video .
