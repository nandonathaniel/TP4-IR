Swipe is central to Tinder 's design . From the compatible matches the app 's algorithm provides , users swipe right to `` like '' potential matches and swipe left to continue on their search . Instagram integration enables users to access other users ' Instagram profiles . Common Connections allows users to see whether they share a mutual Facebook friend with a match ( a first degree connection on Tinder ) or when a user and their match have two separate friends who happen to be friends with each other ( considered second degree on Tinder ) . Tinder Gold , introduced worldwide in August 2017 , is a premium subscription feature that allows the user to see those who have already liked them before swiping .
