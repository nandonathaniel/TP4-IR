Guerrilla warfare in the American Civil War followed the same general patterns of irregular warfare conducted in 19th century Europe . Structurally , they can be divided into three different types of operations -- the so - called ' People 's War ' , ' partisan warfare ' , and ' raiding warfare ' . Each has distinct characteristics that were common practice during the Civil War years ( 1861 -- 1865 ) .
