Hindus and the Muslims belong to two different religions , philosophies , social customs and literature ... It is quite clear that Hindus and Muslims derive their inspiration from different sources of history . They have different epics , different heroes and different episodes ... To yoke together two such nations under a single state , one as a numerical minority and the other as a majority , must lead to growing discontent and final destruction of any fabric that may be so built up for the government of such a state .
