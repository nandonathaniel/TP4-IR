Senatorial opponents of the war wanted to reduce this to a one - year extension , or eliminate the draft altogether , or tie the draft renewal to a timetable for troop withdrawal from Vietnam ; Senator Mike Gravel of Alaska took the most forceful approach , trying to filibuster the draft renewal legislation , shut down conscription , and directly force an end to the war . Senators supporting Nixon 's war efforts supported the bill , even though some had qualms about ending the draft . After a prolonged battle in the Senate , in September 1971 cloture was achieved over the filibuster and the draft renewal bill was approved . Meanwhile , military pay was increased as an incentive to attract volunteers , and television advertising for the U.S. Army began . With the end of active U.S. ground participation in Vietnam , December 1972 saw the last men conscripted , who were born in 1952 and who reported for duty in June 1973 . On February 2 , 1972 , a drawing was held to determine draft priority numbers for men born in 1953 , but in early 1973 it was announced by Secretary of Defense Melvin Laird that no further draft orders would be issued . In March 1973 , 1974 , and 1975 , the Selective Service assigned draft priority numbers for all men born in 1954 , 1955 , and 1956 , in case the draft was extended , but it never was .
