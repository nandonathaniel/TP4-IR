And a woman was there who had been subject to bleeding for twelve years . She had suffered a great deal under the care of many doctors and had spent all she had , yet instead of getting better she grew worse . When she heard about Jesus , she came up behind him in the crowd and touched his cloak , because she thought , `` If I just touch his clothes , I will be healed . '' Immediately her bleeding stopped and she felt in her body that she was freed from her suffering .
