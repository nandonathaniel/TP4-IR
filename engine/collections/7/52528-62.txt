Key to the successes of Tom and Jerry and other MGM cartoons was the work of Scott Bradley , who scored virtually all of the cartoons for the studio from 1934 to 1957 . Bradley 's scores made use of both classical and jazz sensibilities . In addition , he often used songs from the scores of MGM 's feature films , the most frequent of them being `` The Trolley Song '' from Meet Me in St. Louis ( 1944 ) and `` Sing Before Breakfast '' from Broadway Melody of 1936 .
