In order to compare individual striations , examiners must obtain a known sample using the seized weapon . For slower - traveling bullets , such as pistols or revolvers , known bullet exemplars are created by firing the weapon into a water tank . The spent bullet can be recovered , intact , as the water slows down the bullet before it can reach the tank walls , allowing for it to be recovered . For faster traveling bullets , such as those fired from high - powered rifles and military style weapons , water tanks can not be used as the tank will not provide enough stopping power for the projectiles . To examine these weapons , investigators must fire them at a target at a controlled range with enough backing to stop the bullet and collect the spent round after it has been fired .
