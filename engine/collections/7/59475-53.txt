The Great Lakes are estimated to have been formed at the end of the last glacial period ( the Wisconsin glaciation ended 10,000 to 12,000 years ago ) , when the Laurentide Ice Sheet receded . The retreat of the ice sheet left behind a large amount of meltwater ( see Lake Algonquin , Lake Chicago , Glacial Lake Iroquois , and Champlain Sea ) that filled up the basins that the glaciers had carved , thus creating the Great Lakes as we know them today . Because of the uneven nature of glacier erosion , some higher hills became Great Lakes islands . The Niagara Escarpment follows the contour of the Great Lakes between New York and Wisconsin . Land below the glaciers `` rebounded '' as it was uncovered . Since the glaciers covered some areas longer than others , this glacial rebound occurred at different rates .
