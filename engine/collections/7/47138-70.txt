King 's cabinet approved this policy on 24 August 1939 , and in September disapproved of the proposal by the Chiefs of Staff to create two army divisions for overseas service , in part due to cost . His `` moderate '' war strategy soon demonstrated its national and bilingual support in two elections . When Premier of Quebec Maurice Duplessis called an election on an anti-war platform , Ad√©lard Godbout 's Liberals won a majority on 26 October 1939 . When the Legislative Assembly of Ontario passed a resolution criticizing the government for not fighting the war `` in the vigorous manner the people of Canada desire to see '' , King dissolved the federal parliament and , in the resulting election on 26 March 1940 , his Liberals won the largest majority in history .
