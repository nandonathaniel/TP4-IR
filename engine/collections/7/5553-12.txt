α 1 ( \ displaystyle \ alpha _ ( 1 ) ) receptors . Under NE binding α 1 ( \ displaystyle \ alpha _ ( 1 ) ) receptors cause vasoconstriction ( i.e. contraction of the vascular smooth muscle cells decreasing the diameter of the vessels ) . α 1 ( \ displaystyle \ alpha _ ( 1 ) ) receptors are activated in response to shock or low blood pressure as a defensive reaction trying to restore the normal blood pressure . Antagonists of α 1 ( \ displaystyle \ alpha _ ( 1 ) ) receptors ( doxazosin , prazosin ) cause vasodilation ( i.e. decrease in vascular smooth muscle tone with increase of vessel diameter and decrease of the blood pressure ) . ( See also receptor antagonist )
