The cup is an English unit of volume , most commonly associated with cooking and serving sizes . It is traditionally equal to half a liquid pint in either US customary units or the British imperial system but is now separately defined in terms of the metric system at values between ⁄ and ⁄ of a liter . Because actual drinking cups may differ greatly from the size of this unit , standard measuring cups are usually used instead .
