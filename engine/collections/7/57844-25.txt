There are three known chambers inside the Great Pyramid . The lowest chamber is cut into the bedrock upon which the pyramid was built and was unfinished . The so - called Queen 's Chamber and King 's Chamber are higher up within the pyramid structure . The main part of the Giza complex is a set of buildings that included two mortuary temples in honour of Khufu ( one close to the pyramid and one near the Nile ) , three smaller pyramids for Khufu 's wives , an even smaller `` satellite '' pyramid , a raised causeway connecting the two temples , and small mastaba tombs surrounding the pyramid for nobles .
