Marriott 's Great America , built by hotel and restaurant operator Marriott Corporation , opened to the public on March 21 , 1976 . Less than two weeks later on May 29 , the company opened a second Marriott 's Great America -- later known as Six Flags Great America -- north of Chicago in Gurnee , Illinois . A third park was initially planned for the Baltimore -- Washington Metropolitan Area , but the idea was later abandoned after several failed attempts to sway local opposition .
