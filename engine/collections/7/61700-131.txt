In the Turkistan Islamic Party 's Turkestan Al - Islamiyya magazine , Issue 13 , the Rohingya cleric Abu Dhar ' Azzam ( Abu Dhar Al - Burmi ) congratulated the Tsarnaev brothers on their terrorist attack in the Boston Marathon bombing , saying , `` In the very house of unbelief , two Chechen brothers destroyed the infidels ' fortresses on April 16 , 2013 . During the ( ensuing ) search ( by the authorities for the perpetrators ) , the elder brother died as a martyr in the field of glory and honor , Allah willing . The younger brother , Dzokhar , remained , and told his dear nation : ' We did this operation as revenge for what America does in Palestine , Iraq , and Afghanistan . ' He did n't mention his homeland Chechnya , since this jihad is a jihad of ( an entire ) nation , not ( a campaign ) for the liberation of a single land ... The Muslims ' lands are one and their honor is one . ''
