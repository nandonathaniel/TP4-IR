Part of the original ballpark construction of 1912 , the wall is made of wood , but was covered in tin and concrete in 1934 when the scoreboard was added . The wall was covered in hard plastic in 1976 . The scoreboard is manually updated throughout the game . Despite the name , the Green Monster was not painted green until 1947 ; before that it was covered with advertisements . The Monster designation is relatively new ; for most of its history it was simply called `` the wall . '' In 2003 , terrace - style seating was added on top of the wall .
