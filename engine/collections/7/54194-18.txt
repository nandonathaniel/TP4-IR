One of at least nine significant ways in which the remake deviates from its source material , `` Evermore '' is among the film 's songs that emphasize the sadness and loneliness of both the Beast and Belle 's situations . Occurring approximately two - thirds into the film , the song assumes a role that was originally occupied by the song `` If I Ca n't Love Her '' in the Broadway musical , identified by Fred Hawson of ABS - CBN News as `` a grand moving solo '' during which the Beast sincerely expresses his undying feelings for Belle . In Beauty and the Beast , `` Evermore '' appears as a solo performed by the Beast shortly before `` The Mob Song '' as the film approaches its dramatic climax . After the Beast and Belle ( Emma Watson ) share a dance in the castle 's ballroom to Mrs. Potts ( Emma Thompson ) singing `` Beauty and the Beast '' , the couple has a conversation during which the Beast learns how much Belle actually misses her father , Maurice ( Kevin Kline ) . Finally admitting that Belle is no longer his prisoner , the character sings `` Evermore '' shortly after he releases the heroine from the castle , insisting that she return to her village and protect Maurice from Gaston ( Luke Evans ) . Believing that Belle has been lost to him forever , the Beast is heartbroken by the character 's departure and laments his misfortune by performing `` Evermore '' , accepting that releasing his former prisoner makes breaking the enchantress ' spell more difficult , even impossible . Serving as a culmination of both the Beast 's personal and emotional journeys , Tracy Goldman of The Cornell Daily Sun observed that the song `` adds more depth to the character '' by `` highlighting the changes he goes through throughout the movie .
