`` We Are the World '' has been performed live by members of USA for Africa on several occasions both together and individually . One of the earliest such performances came in 1985 , during the rock music concert Live Aid , which ended with more than 100 musicians singing the song on stage . Harry Belafonte and Lionel Richie made surprise appearances for the live rendition of the song . Michael Jackson would have joined the artists , but was `` working around the clock in the studio on a project that he 's made a major commitment to '' , according to his press agent , Norman Winter .
