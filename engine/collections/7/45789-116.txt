Bowel twist ( or similarly , bowel strangulation ) is a comparatively rare event ( usually developing sometime after major bowel surgery ) . It is , however , hard to diagnose correctly , and if left uncorrected can lead to bowel infarction and death . ( The singer Maurice Gibb is understood to have died from this . )
