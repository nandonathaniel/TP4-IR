Most of the Chinese immigrants to Hawaii arrived in the mid-to - late 19th century , when 46,000 people immigrated to the islands . Although many came as laborers for sugar plantations in Hawaii , they concentrated on getting education for their children . When their contracts expired , many decided to remain in Hawaii and opened businesses in areas such as Chinatown . By 1950 most Chinese American men in Hawaii were educated and held good jobs . Today 95 % of Chinese Americans in Hawaii live in Honolulu and work at professional jobs .
