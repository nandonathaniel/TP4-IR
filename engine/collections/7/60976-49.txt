The Fathers of Confederation met at the Quebec Conference of 1864 to discuss the terms of this new union . One issue on the agenda was to determine the Union 's `` feudal rank '' ( see Resolution 71 of the Quebec Conference , 1864 ) . The candidates for the classification of this new union were : `` the Kingdom of Canada '' ( le Royaume du Canada ) , `` the Realm of Canada '' ( le Royaume du Canada ) , `` the Union of Canada '' ( l'Union du Canada ) , and `` the Dominion of Canada '' ( le Dominion du Canada ) .
