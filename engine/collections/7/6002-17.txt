Other versions of the tale were also made . One was an MGM Tex Avery cartoon named Blitz Wolf , a 1942 wartime version with the Wolf as a Nazi . Another animated spoof was a 1952 Warner Brothers cartoon called The Turn - Tale Wolf , directed by Robert McKimson . This cartoon tells the story from the wolf 's point of view and makes the pigs out to be the villains . Another Warner Brothers spoof was Friz Freleng 's The Three Little Bops ( 1957 ) , which depicts the three little pigs as jazz musicians who refuse to let the wolf join their band .
