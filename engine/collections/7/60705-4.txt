By contrast , the origins of pop art in post-War Britain , while employing irony and parody , were more academic . Britain focused on the dynamic and paradoxical imagery of American pop culture as powerful , manipulative symbolic devices that were affecting whole patterns of life , while simultaneously improving the prosperity of a society . Early pop art in Britain was a matter of ideas fueled by American popular culture when viewed from afar . Similarly , pop art was both an extension and a repudiation of Dadaism . While pop art and Dadaism explored some of the same subjects , pop art replaced the destructive , satirical , and anarchic impulses of the Dada movement with a detached affirmation of the artifacts of mass culture . Among those artists in Europe seen as producing work leading up to pop art are : Pablo Picasso , Marcel Duchamp , and Kurt Schwitters .
