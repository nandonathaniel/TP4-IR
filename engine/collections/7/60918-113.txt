Cambridge University Press introduced a change at 1 John 5 : 8 in 1985 , reversing its longstanding tradition of printing the word `` spirit '' in lower case by using a capital letter `` S '' . A Rev. Hardin of Bedford , Pennsylvania , wrote a letter to Cambridge inquiring about this verse , and subsequently received a reply from Dr. Cooper on June 3 , 1985 , admitting that it was a `` matter of some embarrassment regarding the lower case ' s ' in Spirit '' .
