The premiere of True Blood was prefaced with a viral marketing / alternate reality game ( ARG ) campaign , based at BloodCopy.com . This included setting up multiple websites , encoding web address into unmarked envelopes mailed to high - profile blog writers and others , and even performances by a `` vampire '' who attempted to reach out to others of their kind , to discuss the recent creation of `` TrueBlood '' , a fictional beverage featured in the show . A MySpace account with the username `` Blood '' had , as of June 19 , uploaded two videos ; one entitled `` Vampire Taste Test -- True Blood vs Human '' , and one called `` BloodCopy Exclusive INTERVIEW WITH SAMSON THE VAMPIRE '' .
