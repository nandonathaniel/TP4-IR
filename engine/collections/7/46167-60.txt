Henley achieved arguably the greatest commercial solo success of any former Eagle . In 1981 , he sang a duet with Stevie Nicks of Fleetwood Mac fame , `` Leather and Lace . '' In 1982 , he released I Ca n't Stand Still , featuring the hit `` Dirty Laundry . '' This album would pale in comparison to his next release , Building the Perfect Beast ( 1984 ) , which features the classic rock radio staples `` The Boys of Summer '' ( a Billboard number 5 hit ) , `` All She Wants to Do Is Dance '' ( number 9 ) , `` Not Enough Love in the World '' ( number 34 ) and `` Sunset Grill '' ( number 22 ) . Henley 's next album , The End of the Innocence ( 1989 ) , was also a major success . It includes `` The End of the Innocence , '' `` The Last Worthless Evening '' and `` The Heart of the Matter . '' His solo career was cut short due to a contract dispute with his record company , which was finally resolved when the Eagles reunited in 1994 .
