The Chinese were already familiar with the techniques of wall - building by the time of the Spring and Autumn period between the 8th and 5th centuries BC . During this time and the subsequent Warring States period , the states of Qin , Wei , Zhao , Qi , Yan , and Zhongshan all constructed extensive fortifications to defend their own borders . Built to withstand the attack of small arms such as swords and spears , these walls were made mostly by stamping earth and gravel between board frames .
