The question of finding a route between the Oxus valley and India has been of concern historically . A direct route crosses extremely high mountain passes in the Hindu Kush and isolated areas like Kafiristan . Some in Britain feared that the Empire of Russia , which at the time wielded great influence over the Oxus area , would overcome these obstacles and find a suitable route through which to invade British India -- but this never came to pass . The area was taken over by Russia during the Russian conquest of Turkestan .
