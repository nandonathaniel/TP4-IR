The Second Amendment protects the individual right to keep and bear arms . The concept of such a right existed within English common law long before the enactment of the Bill of Rights . First codified in the English Bill of Rights of 1689 ( but there only applying to Protestants ) , this right was enshrined in fundamental laws of several American states during the Revolutionary era , including the 1776 Virginia Declaration of Rights and the Pennsylvania Constitution of 1776 . Long a controversial issue in American political , legal , and social discourse , the Second Amendment has been at the heart of several Supreme Court decisions .
