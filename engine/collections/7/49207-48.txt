San Jose also signed forward Scott Nichol and added grit to the team by signing Joe Callahan , Jed Ortmeyer and Manny Malhotra , plus Benn Ferriero . Jeremy Roenick and Claude Lemieux both announced their retirements from the NHL . Another major move by San Jose was stripping Patrick Marleau of the captaincy and assigning it to the newly re-signed Rob Blake . One reason for the move was that Marleau was named captain by Wilson and McLellan wanted to name his own . Dan Boyle and Joe Thornton were named the alternates . On February 7 , 2010 , San Jose acquired Niclas Wallin from the Carolina Hurricanes . On February 12 , 2010 , San Jose traded Jody Shelley to the New York Rangers for a draft pick .
