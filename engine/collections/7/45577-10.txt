The Act also covers cross-breeds of the above four types of dog . Dangerous dogs are classified by `` type '' , not by breed label . This means that whether a dog is prohibited under the Act will depend on a judgement about its physical characteristics , and whether they match the description of a prohibited `` type '' . This assessment of the physical characteristics is made by a court .
