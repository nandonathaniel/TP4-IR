Wetzel was recognised by the United States Patent Office as having invented the ATM in the form of U.S. Patent # 3,761,682 ; the application had been filed in October 1971 and the patent was granted in 1973 . However , the U.S. patent record cites at least three previous applications from Docutel , all relevant to the development of the ATM and where Wetzel does not figure , namely US Patent # 3,662,343 , U.S. Patent # 3651976 and U.S. Patent # 3 , 68,569 . These patents are all credited to Kenneth S. Goldstein , MR Karecki , TR Barnes , GR Chastian and John D. White .
