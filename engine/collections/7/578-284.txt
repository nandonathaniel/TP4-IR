The Vedic religion of the later Vedic period co-existed with local religions , such as the Yaksha cults , and was itself the product of `` a composite of the Indo - Aryan and Harappan cultures and civilizations '' . David Gordon White cites three other mainstream scholars who `` have emphatically demonstrated '' that Vedic religion is partially derived from the Indus Valley Civilizations . The religion of the Indo - Aryans was further developed when they migrated into the Ganges Plain after c. 1100 BCE and became settled farmers , further syncretising with the native cultures of northern India .
