Southeast of the National Park , the disused Cromford Canal ran from Cromford to the Erewash Canal and formerly served the lead mines at Wirksworth and cotton mills of Sir Richard Arkwright . The Caldon Canal runs southwest of the park from Froghall and was built to transport limestone from the quarries at Cauldon Low for the iron industry and flints for the pottery industry .
