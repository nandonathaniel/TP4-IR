In the first birthing season for dolphins after the spill , dead baby dolphins washed up along Mississippi and Alabama shorelines at about 10 times the normal number . A peer - reviewed NOAA / BP study disclosed that nearly half the bottlenose dolphins tested in mid-2011 in Barataria Bay , a heavily oiled area , were in `` guarded or worse '' condition , `` including 17 percent that were not expected to survive '' . BP officials deny that the disease conditions are related to the spill , saying that dolphin deaths actually began being reported before the BP oil spill . By 2013 , over 650 dolphins had been found stranded in the oil spill area , a four-fold increase over the historical average . The National Wildlife Federation ( NWF ) reports that sea turtles , mostly endangered Kemp 's ridley sea turtles , have been stranding at a high rate . Before the spill there were an average of 100 strandings per year ; since the spill the number has jumped to roughly 500 . NWF senior scientist Doug Inkley notes that the marine death rates are unprecedented and occurring high in the food chain , strongly suggesting there is `` something amiss with the Gulf ecosystem '' . In December 2013 , the journal Environmental Science & Technology published a study finding that of 32 dolphins briefly captured from 24 - km stretch near southeastern Louisiana , half were seriously ill or dying . BP said the report was `` inconclusive as to any causation associated with the spill '' .
