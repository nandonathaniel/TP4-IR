In 1992 a copyright case Qimron v. Shanks was brought before the Israeli District court by scholar Elisha Qimron against Hershel Shanks of the Biblical Archaeology Society for violations of United States copyright law regarding his publishing of reconstructions of Dead Sea Scroll texts done by Qimron in A Facsimile Edition of the Dead Sea Scrolls which were included without his permission . Qimron 's suit against the Biblical Archaeology Society was done on the grounds that the research they had published was his intellectual property as he had reconstructed about 40 % of the published text . In 1993 , the district court Judge Dalia Dorner ruled for the plaintiff , Elisha Qimron , in context of both United States and Israeli copyright law and granted the highest compensation allowed by law for aggravation in compensation against Hershel Shanks and others . In an appeal in 2000 in front of Judge Aharon Barak , the verdict was upheld in Israeli Supreme Court in Qimron 's favor . The court case established the two main principles from which facsimiles are examined under copyright law of the United States and Israel : authorship and originality .
