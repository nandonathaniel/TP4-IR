Between 1984 and 1988 CERN began installation and operation of TCP / IP to interconnect its major internal computer systems , workstations , PCs and an accelerator control system . CERN continued to operate a limited self - developed system ( CERNET ) internally and several incompatible ( typically proprietary ) network protocols externally . There was considerable resistance in Europe towards more widespread use of TCP / IP , and the CERN TCP / IP intranets remained isolated from the Internet until 1989 .
