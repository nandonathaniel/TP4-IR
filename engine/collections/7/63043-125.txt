Some aspects of traditional African cultures have become less practised in recent years as a result of neglect and suppression by colonial and post-colonial regimes . For example , African customs were discouraged , and African languages were prohibited in mission schools . Leopold II of Belgium attempted to `` civilize '' Africans by discouraging polygamy and witchcraft .
