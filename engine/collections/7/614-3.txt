The Cornell method provides a systematic format for condensing and organizing notes . The student divides the paper into two columns : the note - taking column ( usually on the right ) is twice the size of the questions / key word column ( on the left ) . The student should leave five to seven lines , or about two in ( 5 cm ) , at the bottom of the page .
