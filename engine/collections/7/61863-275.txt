Based upon the substantial evidence presented at trial , this court finds that Dade County Ordinance No. 89 - 022 provides sufficient guidance to dog owners , both in its explicit reference to pit bull dogs , and in its definitional section , to enable pit bull owners to determine whether their dogs fall within the proscriptions of the ordinance ... Certainly there are some applications of the ordinance which pass constitutional muster . As long as the enactment is not impermissibly vague in all its applications , this court must uphold its constitutionality . Upon consideration of the evidence presented at trial , the pleadings , memoranda , exhibits and arguments of counsel and upon application of the controlling authority , this court finds that plaintiffs have failed to meet their burden of proof and that the Court is required to uphold the constitutionality of Dade County Ordinance No. 089 - 22 .
