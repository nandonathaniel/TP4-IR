I am in my first year teaching American history at the high school level , and I thought this article was incredibly helpful , both to me and to my students . Too often , websites or online encyclopedias provide only a cursory overview of the Civil War , or present the lead - up to the conflict as an inevitable polarisation of ' Slavery v. Anti-Slavery ' and ' States Rights v. Federalism ' . Certainly these themes are central to the conflict , but they were neither inevitable nor straightforward - nor did they take on the moral overtones people tend to give them today . This article avoids those pitfalls - thanks .
