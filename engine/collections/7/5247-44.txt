Mark Jackson as Isaac , the Orville 's Science and Engineering Officer . Isaac is a member of the artificial , non-biological race from Kaylon - 1 that views biological lifeforms , including humans , as inferior . Isaac explains to Mercer in the pilot that the Union 's Admiralty offered a posting to any Kaylon willing to accept it , as an attempt to initiate relations between the two powers . Isaac accepted the offer because he saw it as a way to study human behavior . During the course of his time with the crew , he comes to observe and understand aspects of human behavior , such as sarcasm , slang , and practical jokes . Isaac perceives his surroundings with his body 's internal sensors , and not with the two glowing blue `` eyes '' on his face , which are purely aesthetic .
