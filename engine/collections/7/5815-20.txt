The Texas handgun carry permit was previously called a `` Concealed Handgun License '' or CHL . This has changed on Jan 1 . 2016 to LTC `` License To Carry '' and at the same time the laws changed to include `` Open Carry '' . Permits are issued on a non-discretionary ( `` shall - issue '' ) basis to all eligible , qualified applicants . Texas has full reciprocity agreements with 30 states , not including Vermont ( which is an `` unrestricted '' state and neither issues nor requires permits ) , most of these having some residency restrictions ( the holder must either be a resident of Texas or a non-resident of the reciprocal state for the Texas license to be valid in that state ) . Texas recognizes an additional 11 states ' concealed - carry permits unilaterally ; those states do not recognize Texas ' own permit as valid within their jurisdiction , usually due to some lesser requirement of the Texas permit compared to their own .
