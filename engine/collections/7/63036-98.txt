In 1941 the United States Army sought more and better training centers for the rapid development of its armored and infantry forces . In March 1941 , the Army acquired approximately 86,000 acres ( 35,000 ha ) of open ranch lands along the Central Coast of California between Lompoc and Santa Maria . Most of the land was purchased . Smaller parcels were obtained either by lease , license , or as easements . With its flat plateau , surrounding hills , numerous canyons , and relative remoteness from populated areas , the Army was convinced it had found the ideal training location .
