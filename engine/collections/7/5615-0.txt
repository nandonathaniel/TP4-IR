A commercial vehicle is any type of motor vehicle used for transporting goods or paying passengers . The European Union defines a `` commercial motor vehicle '' as any motorised road vehicle , that by its type of construction and equipment is designed for , and capable of transporting , whether for payment or not : ( 1 ) more than nine persons , including the driver ; ( 2 ) goods and `` standard fuel tanks '' . This means the tanks permanently fixed by the manufacturer to all motor vehicles of the same type as the vehicle in question and whose permanent fitting lets fuel be used directly , both for propulsion and , where appropriate , to power a refrigeration system . Gas tanks fitted to motor vehicles for the direct use of diesel as a fuel are considered standard fuel tanks .
