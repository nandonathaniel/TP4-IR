A major environmental concern known as topsoil erosion occurs when the topsoil layer is blown or washed away . Without topsoil , little plant life is possible . The estimated annual costs of public and environmental health losses related to soil erosion exceed $45 billion . Conventional agriculture encourages the depletion of topsoil because the soil must be plowed and replanted each year . Sustainable techniques attempt to slow erosion through the use of cover crops in order to build organic matter in the soil . The United States alone loses almost 3 tons of topsoil per acre per year . This is of great ecological concern as one inch of topsoil can take between 500 and 1,000 years to form naturally . On current trends , the world has about 60 years of topsoil left .
