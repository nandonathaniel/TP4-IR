Ecological economics now seeks to bridge the gap between ecology and traditional neoclassical economics : it provides an inclusive and ethical economic model for society . A plethora of new concepts to help implement and measure sustainability are becoming more widely accepted including the car - free movement , smart growth ( more sustainable urban environments ) , life cycle assessment ( the cradle to cradle analysis of resource use and environmental impact over the life cycle of a product or process ) , ecological footprint analysis , green building , dematerialization ( increased recycling of materials ) , decarbonisation ( removing dependence on fossil fuels ) and much more .
