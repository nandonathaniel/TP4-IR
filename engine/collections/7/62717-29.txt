For decades , from the 1920s to the 1980s , world championship matches in professional boxing were scheduled for fifteen rounds , but that changed after a November 13 , 1982 WBA Lightweight title bout ended with the death of boxer Duk Koo Kim in a fight against Ray Mancini in the 14th round of a nationally televised championship fight on CBS . Exactly three months after the fatal fight , the WBC reduced the number of their championship fights to 12 rounds . The WBA even stripped a fighter of his championship in 1983 because the fight had been a 15 - round bout , shortly after the rule was changed to 12 rounds . By 1988 , to the displeasure of some boxing purists , all fights had been reduced to a maximum of 12 rounds only , partially for safety , and partially for television , as a 12 - round bout could be broadcast within an hour , while a 15 - round bout could require up to 90 minutes to broadcast .
