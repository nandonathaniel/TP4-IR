Olympic Gold medals are required to be made from at least 92.5 % silver , and must contain a minimum of 6 grams of gold . All Olympic medals must be at least 60mm in diameter and 3mm thick . Minting the medals is the responsibility of the Olympic host . From 1928 through 1968 the design was always the same : the obverse showed a generic design by Florentine artist Giuseppe Cassioli of Greek goddess Nike with Rome 's Colloseum in the background and text naming the host city ; the reverse showed another generic design of Nike saluting an Olympic champion .
