As Ellis wrote in the booklet notes to a later compilation CD , Singles A 's and B 's , `` In an attempt to break the mould we recorded a song far removed from the anthemic - like previous hits . The song was called `` Baby I Know '' . Released at the end of 1969 , competing with releases from other big names for a place in the charts over Christmas , it failed completely . Ellis felt the band had run its course and he left in December 1969 for a solo career : `` We never really made it big anywhere but Britain and I think that if we had started to happen in America , I would n't have left '' . The rest of the band soldiered on without any further success , continuing briefly as L.A. with new vocalist , August Eadon ( aka Gus Yeadon ) . Further releases likewise never charted .
