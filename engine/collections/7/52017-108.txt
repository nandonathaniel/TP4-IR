where i ( \ displaystyle i ) is the imaginary unit . If the mean μ = 0 ( \ displaystyle \ mu = 0 ) , the first factor is 1 , and the Fourier transform is , apart from a constant factor , a normal density on the frequency domain , with mean 0 and standard deviation 1 / σ ( \ displaystyle 1 / \ sigma ) . In particular , the standard normal distribution φ ( \ displaystyle \ varphi ) is an eigenfunction of the Fourier transform .
