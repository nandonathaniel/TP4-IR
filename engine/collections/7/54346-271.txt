Johnson learned of the Nixon - Chennault effort because the NSA was interfering in communications in Vietnam . In response , Johnson ordered NSA surveillance of Chennault and wire - tapped the South Vietnamese embassy and members of the Nixon campaign . He did not leak the information to the public because he did not want to `` shock America '' with the revelation , nor reveal that the NSA was interfering in communications in Vietnam . Johnson did make information available to Humphrey , but at this point Humphrey thought he was going to win the election , so he did not reveal the information to the public . Humphrey later regretted this as a mistake . The South Vietnamese government withdrew from peace negotiations , and Nixon publicly offered to go to Saigon to help the negotiations . A promising `` peace bump '' ended up in `` shambles '' for the Democratic Party .
