The disinclination to rule what the Europeans had `` conquered '' is apparent throughout the protocols of the Berlin Conference , but especially in `` The Principle of Effective Occupation . '' In line with Germany and Britain 's opposing views , the powers finally agreed that this could be established by a European power establishing some kind of base on the coast , from which it was free to expand into the interior . The Europeans did not believe that the rules of occupation demanded European hegemony on the ground . The Belgians originally wanted to include that `` effective occupation '' required provisions that `` cause peace to be administered '' , but other powers , specifically Britain and France , had that amendment struck out of the final document .
