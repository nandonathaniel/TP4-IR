Jeremy Renner as Clint Barton / Hawkeye : An Avenger and master archer who previously worked as an agent for S.H.I.E.L.D. Whedon said that Hawkeye interacts more with the other characters in the film , as opposed to the first film where the character had been `` possessed pretty early by a bad guy and had to walk around all scowly . '' As the character did not appear in any other of Marvel 's Phase Two films , Whedon stated Age of Ultron sheds light on to what the character was doing since the end of The Avengers . Renner described the character as `` kind of a loner '' and `` a team player only ' cause he sort of has to be . He 's not really a company man . Captain America can be that guy . In ( Age of Ultron ) you 'll understand why ( Hawkeye ) thinks the way he thinks . ''
