In 1985 , Wintour attained her first editorship , taking over the UK edition of Vogue after Beatrix Miller retired . Once in charge , she replaced many of the staff and exerted far more control over the magazine than any previous editor had , earning the nickname `` Nuclear Wintour '' in the process . Those editors who were retained began to refer to the period as `` The Wintour of Our Discontent . '' Her changes moved the magazine from its traditional eccentricity to a direction more in line with the American magazine . Wintour 's ideal reader was the same woman Savvy had tried to reach . `` There 's a new kind of woman out there , '' she told the Evening Standard . `` She 's interested in business and money . She does n't have time to shop anymore . She wants to know what and why and where and how . ''
