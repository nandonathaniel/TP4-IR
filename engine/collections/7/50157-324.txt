The reality of God is never argued but is always assumed and affirmed Jesus Christ is absolutely central : he is Lord and Savior , the foretold Prophet , the Messianic King , the Chosen , the way , the truth , and the light , the One through whom God the Father not only acted but through whom He came The Holy Spirit came anew with Jesus Christ . The Christian faith and life are a calling , rooted in divine election . The plight of everyone as sinner means that each person is completely dependent upon the mercy and grace of God Salvation is both God 's gift and his demand through Jesus Christ , to be received by faith The death and resurrection of Jesus are at the heart of the total event of which he was the center God creates a people of his own , designated and described by varied terminology and analogies History must be understood eschatologically , being brought along toward its ultimate goal when the kingdom of God , already present in Christ , is brought to its complete triumph In Christ , all of God 's work of creation , revelation , and redemption is brought to fulfillment
