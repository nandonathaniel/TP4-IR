Although `` castle '' has not become a generic term for a manor house ( like ch√¢teau in French and Schloss in German ) , many manor houses contain `` castle '' in their name while having few if any of the architectural characteristics , usually as their owners liked to maintain a link to the past and felt the term `` castle '' was a masculine expression of their power . In scholarship the castle , as defined above , is generally accepted as a coherent concept , originating in Europe and later spreading to parts of the Middle East , where they were introduced by European Crusaders . This coherent group shared a common origin , dealt with a particular mode of warfare , and exchanged influences .
