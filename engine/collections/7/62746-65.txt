In hoax reality shows , a false premise is presented to some of the series participants ; the rest of the cast may contain actors who are in on the joke . These shows often served to parody the conventions of the reality television genre . The first such show was the 2003 American series The Joe Schmo Show . Other examples are My Big Fat Obnoxious Boss ( modeled after The Apprentice ) , My Big Fat Obnoxious Fiance , Hell Date ( modeled after Blind Date ) , Superstar USA ( modeled after American Idol ) , Bedsitcom ( modeled after Big Brother ) , Space Cadets ( which convinced the hoax targets that they were being flown into space ) , Invasion Iowa ( in which a town was convinced that William Shatner was filming a movie there ) and Reality Hell ( which featured a different target and premise every episode ) . Other hoax shows are not intended for comedic effect and do not include actors . In some shows , a person of wealth or power has their identity disguised so that they can go among less - privileged people in order to see them in their natural state and judge their worthiness for largesse ; the other participants are not told the true nature of the show during filming . Popular examples include Undercover Boss ( though that show is also intended to let bosses see their business more accurately ) and The Secret Millionaire . Other shows , though not hoax shows per se , have offered misleading information to some cast members in order to add a wrinkle to the competition . Examples include Boy Meets Boy and Joe Millionaire .
