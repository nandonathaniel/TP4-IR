Custer was found with shots to the left chest and left temple . Either wound would have been fatal , though he appeared to have bled from only the chest wound , meaning his head wound may have been delivered postmortem . He also suffered a wound to the arm . Some Lakota oral histories assert that Custer committed suicide to avoid capture and subsequent torture , though this is usually discounted since the wounds were inconsistent with his known right - handedness . ( Other native accounts note several soldiers committing suicide near the end of the battle . ) Custer 's body was found near the top of Custer Hill , which also came to be known as `` Last Stand Hill '' . There the United States erected a tall memorial obelisk inscribed with the names of the 7th Cavalry 's casualties .
