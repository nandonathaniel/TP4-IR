In the song a beggar talks back to the system that stole his job . Gorney said in an interview in 1974 `` I did n't want a song to depress people . I wanted to write a song to make people think . It is n't a hand - me - out song of ' give me a dime , I 'm starving , I 'm bitter ' , it was n't that kind of sentimentality '' . The song asks why the men who built the nation -- built the railroads , built the skyscrapers -- who fought in the war ( World War I ) , who tilled the earth , who did what their nation asked of them should , now that the work is done and their labor no longer necessary , find themselves abandoned and in bread lines . Asking for an act of charity , the singer requests a Dime ( equivalent to $1.46 in 2017 ) .
