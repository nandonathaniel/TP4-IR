The term ' ethnic cleansing ' has frequently been employed to refer to the events in Bosnia and Herzegovina which are the subject of this case ... ( UN ) General Assembly resolution 47 / 121 referred in its Preamble to ' the abhorrent policy of `` ethnic cleansing '' , which is a form of genocide ' , as being carried on in Bosnia and Herzegovina ... It ( i.e. , ethnic cleansing ) can only be a form of genocide within the meaning of the ( Genocide ) Convention , if it corresponds to or falls within one of the categories of acts prohibited by Article II of the Convention . Neither the intent , as a matter of policy , to render an area `` ethnically homogeneous '' , nor the operations that may be carried out to implement such policy , can as such be designated as genocide : the intent that characterizes genocide is `` to destroy , in whole or in part '' a particular group , and deportation or displacement of the members of a group , even if effected by force , is not necessarily equivalent to destruction of that group , nor is such destruction an automatic consequence of the displacement . This is not to say that acts described as ' ethnic cleansing ' may never constitute genocide , if they are such as to be characterized as , for example , ' deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part ' , contrary to Article II , paragraph ( c ) , of the Convention , provided such action is carried out with the necessary specific intent ( dolus specialis ) , that is to say with a view to the destruction of the group , as distinct from its removal from the region . As the ICTY has observed , while ' there are obvious similarities between a genocidal policy and the policy commonly known as ' ethnic cleansing ' ( KrstiÄ‡ , IT - 98 - 33 - T , Trial Chamber Judgment , 2 August 2001 , para. 562 ) , yet ' ( a ) clear distinction must be drawn between physical destruction and mere dissolution of a group . The expulsion of a group or part of a group does not in itself suffice for genocide . '
