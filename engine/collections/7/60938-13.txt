A sarcomere is defined as the segment between two neighbouring Z - lines ( or Z - discs , or Z bodies ) . In electron micrographs of cross-striated muscle , the Z - line ( from the German `` Zwischenscheibe '' , the disc in between the I bands ) appears as a series of dark lines . They act as an anchoring point of the actin filaments . Surrounding the Z - line is the region of the I - band ( for isotropic ) . I - band is the zone of thin filaments that is not superimposed by thick filaments ( myosin ) . Following the I - band is the A-band ( for anisotropic ) . Named for their properties under a polarizing microscope . An A-band contains the entire length of a single thick filament . Within the A-band is a paler region called the H - zone ( from the German `` heller '' , brighter ) . Named for their lighter appearance under a polarization microscope . H - band is the zone of the thick filaments that is not superimposed by the thin filaments ( actin ) . Within the H - zone is a thin M - line ( from the German `` Mittelscheibe '' , the disc in the middle of the sarcomere ) formed of cross-connecting elements of the cytoskeleton .
