Palilalia ( from the Greek πάλιν ( pálin ) meaning `` again '' and λαλιά ( laliá ) meaning `` speech '' or `` to talk '' ) , a complex tic , is a language disorder characterized by the involuntary repetition of syllables , words , or phrases . It has features resembling other complex tics such as echolalia or coprolalia , but , unlike other aphasias , palilalia is based upon contextually correct speech .
