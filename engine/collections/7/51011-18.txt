The course and watershed of the Orange River , Caledon River and Vaal River . This map shows a conservative border for the watershed . Specifically , the Kalahari basin is excluded , as some sources say it is endorheic . Some other sources using computational methods show a basin which includes parts of Botswana ( and hence of the Kalahari ) .
