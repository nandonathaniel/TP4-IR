The flag of the Netherlands has been said to be the origin of the Indonesian flag . To symbolize the intention of forcing out the Dutch , the Indonesian nationalists would rip apart the Dutch flag . They tore off the bottom third of the flag , and separated the red and white colours from the blue colour .
