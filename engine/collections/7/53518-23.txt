The excitation P680 â†’ P680 of the reaction center pigment P680 occurs here . These special chlorophyll molecules embedded in PS II absorb the energy of photons , with maximal absorption at 680 nm . Electrons within these molecules are promoted to a higher - energy state . This is one of two core processes in photosynthesis , and it occurs with astonishing efficiency ( greater than 90 % ) because , in addition to direct excitation by light at 680 nm , the energy of light first harvested by antenna proteins at other wavelengths in the light - harvesting system is also transferred to these special chlorophyll molecules .
