Although not specifically mentioned in the Constitution , Congress has also long asserted the power to investigate and the power to compel cooperation with an investigation . The Supreme Court has affirmed these powers as an implication of Congress 's power to legislate . Since the power to investigate is an aspect of Congress 's power to legislate , it is as broad as Congress 's powers to legislate . However , it is also limited to inquiries that are `` in aid of the legislative function ; '' Congress may not `` expose for the sake of exposure . '' It is uncontroversial that a proper subject of Congress 's investigation power is the operations of the federal government , but Congress 's ability to compel the submission of documents or testimony from the President or his subordinates is often - discussed and sometimes controversial ( see executive privilege ) , although not often litigated . As a practical matter , the limitation of Congress 's ability to investigate only for a proper purpose ( `` in aid of '' its legislative powers ) functions as a limit on Congress 's ability to investigate the private affairs of individual citizens ; matters that simply demand action by another branch of government , without implicating an issue of public policy necessitating legislation by Congress , must be left to those branches due to the doctrine of separation of powers . The courts are highly deferential to Congress 's exercise of its investigation powers , however . Congress has the power to investigate that which it could regulate , and the courts have interpreted Congress 's regulatory powers broadly since the Great Depression .
