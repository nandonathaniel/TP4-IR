The Firth encompasses many Islands and Peninsulas and has twelve ferry routes connecting them to the mainland and each other . Sometimes called the Clyde Waters , this water body is customarily considered an element of the Irish Sea . The ferry services are run by Caledonian MacBrayne and by Western Ferries and many of the routes are lifeline services for communities living in remote areas . A great number of sea lochs adjoin the Firth , the largest being Loch Fyne .
