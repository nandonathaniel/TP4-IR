In the first Kingdom Hearts , during a time in which the spell had not yet broken , Beast 's home is attacked by the Heartless , led by Maleficent , who take Belle captive . Determined to rescue Belle , Beast goes as far as to exploit the power of darkness and risk his own life to transport himself to Hollow Bastion , where Belle is being held captive with the other six Princesses of Heart . Upon arriving in Hollow Bastion , Beast is confronted by Riku , who challenges him to a duel and easily defeats him . Beast is saved at the last minute by Sora , Donald and Goofy , who are looking for Kairi . Allying himself with Sora , since Donald and Goofy have temporarily joined Riku , Beast fights the Heartless and protects Sora while they work their way into the Hollow Baston castle . Entering the castle , Beast , Sora , Donald and Goofy fight their way through until they encounter and defeat Maleficent , who transforms into her dragon form and challenges them once again , only to be defeated once more . The four heroes find Kairi , but the circumstances cause Sora , Donald , Goofy and Kairi to leave Hollow Bastion , and Beast states that he will not leave without Belle . Later on , Beast encounters Sora once again when he returns to Hollow Bastion to lock the Keyhole . During their second search , Beast and Sora find Belle , who embraces Beast and presents Sora with the Divine Rose Keychain . In the Final Mix version of the game , Beast allies himself with Sora once again to fight and defeat Xemnas ( then known as `` Unknown '' ) .
