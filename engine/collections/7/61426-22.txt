In April 1876 he returned to England to take unpaid work as a supply teacher in a small boarding school in Ramsgate . When the proprietor moved to Isleworth in Middlesex , Van Gogh went with him . The arrangement did not work out and he left to become a Methodist minister 's assistant . His parents had meanwhile moved to Etten ; in 1876 he returned home at Christmas for six months and took work at a bookshop in Dordrecht . He was unhappy in the position and spent his time doodling or translating passages from the Bible into English , French and German . He immersed himself in religion , and became increasingly pious and monastic . According to his flatmate of the time , Paulus van GÃ¶rlitz , Van Gogh ate frugally , avoiding meat .
