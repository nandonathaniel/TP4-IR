The beneficiary rule ( informally known as the `` lucky dog '' rule ) states once the safety car is deployed , the first car not on the lead lap will regain a lap . The Beneficiary will regain his lap once pit road opens . Bodine will signal that car to pass him through radio contact between NASCAR and that team . The free pass car must pit with the lapped cars .
