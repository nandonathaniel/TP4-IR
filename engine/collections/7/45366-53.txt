Chuck later returns to give Bree his number again after assuming she 'd lost it since he has n't received a call from her . Bree then agrees to go out on a date with him that night and when Bree tells this to Renee , Renee runs a background check on Chuck and reveals to Bree that he 's still married ( though he had filed for divorce a year ago ) . At dinner , Bree confronts Chuck with this information but Chuck retaliates by telling her that he had also run a background check on her , therefore becoming more aware of Bree 's past . Offended , Bree abruptly ends their date and as Chuck drives her home , Chuck catches a hooker in the street and brings her back to the women 's center . There , Chuck tells the hooker ( who believes that she 'll be a hooker forever ) that she can turn her life around , pretending to reveal that Bree once was a prostitute and she had turned over a new leaf by going to school and starting a massive catering company . Moved by Chuck 's whole - heartedly words , Bree gives Chuck a second chance and the two agree to go out on another date afterwards .
