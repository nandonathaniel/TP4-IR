Puerto Ricans `` were collectively made U.S. citizens '' in 1917 as a result of the Jones - Shafroth Act . U.S. citizens residing in Puerto Rico can not vote for the U.S. president , though both major parties , Republican and Democratic , run primary elections in Puerto Rico to send delegates to vote on a presidential candidate . Since Puerto Rico is an unincorporated territory ( see above ) and not a U.S. state , the United States Constitution does not fully enfranchise U.S. citizens residing in Puerto Rico .
