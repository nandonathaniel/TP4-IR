With the lyrics `` Will you still love me when I 'm no longer young and beautiful ? '' , Del Rey adds a hint of desperation which parallels the idiosyncrasies faced by the characters in F. Scott Fitzgerald 's classic novel The Great Gatsby . Del Rey 's dreamy vocals are draped over sedated strings and canned percussion . The soft and dreary vocals , falling in line with Del Rey 's retro affectation , fits the atmosphere of the 1920s when the novel is set . The lyrics rotate around the themes of pleasing a lover , nostalgia , and the gloom of aging . The Cedric Gervais remix of the song was released on October 11 , 2013 .
