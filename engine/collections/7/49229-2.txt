The noble gases ( helium , neon , argon , krypton , xenon , and radon ) are also gases at STP , but they are monatomic . The homonuclear diatomic gases and noble gases together are called `` elemental gases '' or `` molecular gases '' , to distinguish them from other gases that are chemical compounds .
