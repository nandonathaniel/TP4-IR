Most likely voiced by actor and singer Sheb Wooley , the sound is named after Private Wilhelm , a character in The Charge at Feather River , a 1953 Western in which the character gets shot in the thigh with an arrow . This was its first use from the Warner Bros. stock sound library , although The Charge at Feather River is believed to have been the third movie to use the effect .
