Wayne 's daughter Aissa wrote , `` I think making The Alamo became my father 's own form of combat . More than an obsession , it was the most intensely personal project in his career . '' Many of Wayne 's associates agreed that the film was a political platform for Wayne . Many of the statements that his character made reflected Wayne 's anti-communist views . To be sure , there is an overwhelming theme of freedom and the right of individuals to make their own decisions . One may point to a scene in which Wayne , as Crockett , remarks : `` Republic . I like the sound of the word . Means that people can live free , talk free , go or come , buy or sell , be drunk or sober , however they choose . Some words give you a feeling . Republic is one of those words that makes me tight in the throat . ''
