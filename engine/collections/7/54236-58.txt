In United States v. Lopez , a federal law mandating a `` gun - free zone '' on and around public school campuses was struck down because , the Supreme Court ruled , there was no clause in the Constitution authorizing it . This was the first modern Supreme Court opinion to limit the government 's power under the Commerce Clause . The opinion did not mention the Tenth Amendment , and the Court 's 1985 Garcia opinion remains the controlling authority on that subject .
