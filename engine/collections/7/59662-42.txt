At the conclusion of each episode , a winner or several winners were chosen arbitrarily by Carey . The `` prize '' was either to play a game with the host , or to sit out while the other performers did so . After this game during the first season of the series , credits simply rolled under the show 's theme . In the second season , the reading of the credits was performed by one or more cast members in a comedic fashion , based on a theme announced by Carey that often derived from a successful joke earlier in the show .
