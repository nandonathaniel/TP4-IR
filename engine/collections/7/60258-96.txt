The river is partially navigable in the estuary reach around Bharuch but the river has never been a transport artery . The idea for inland navigation emanated with NWDT giving its award for the two main dams -- the Sardar Sarovar in Gujarat 180 kilometres ( 110 mi ) from the coast and the Narmada Sagar in Madhya Pradesh -- the two dams separated by a river distance of about 900 kilometres ( 560 mi ) , and the plans to build two other dams in between on the main stem of the river . A feasibility study has been carried out for navigating the Narmada from the sea up to Hoshangabad -- a distance of 639 kilometres ( 397 mi ) -- or even up to Jabalpur a further distance of 309 kilometres ( 192 mi ) , upstream . The main challenge in these studies is the arrangements to be planned to negotiate the Maheswar , Indira Sagar , Omkareswar , and Sardar Sarovar projects . As such , the navigation option is still open and probably can only be pursued after all the above dams are completed and other implications examined . As Varghese states , `` The notion of seeing barge -- trains plying the river up to Hoshangabad or Jabalpur is not far -- fetched . They could become major inland ports . ''
