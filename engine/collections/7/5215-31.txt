Next , they recorded a song that Barrett had written in a few minutes , `` Here I Go '' , which required no overdubs at all . This session for `` No Man 's Land '' and `` Here I Go '' lasted just three hours . When asked if he had any new songs for the following week 's session , on 23 April , Barrett 's replied that he had `` a weird idea I want to try out '' and that other musicians would not be required . Afterwards , Barrett mentioned that he was interested in revisiting one of the Jenner tracks âˆ’ `` Rhamadam '' . On the morning of the 23rd , Barrett arrived at the studio with a cassette player , on which he had recorded motorbike sounds ; these , he told Jones , were `` all ready to ( be ) put onto the ' Rhamadam ' four track '' . The producer described the sound quality as `` terrible '' , an opinion that was confirmed once Barrett 's player had been hooked up to a 4 - track machine . Instead it was decided that Barrett should source the motorbike sounds from EMI 's large sound effects library . The selection process took up to an hour , at which point Jones started to lose faith in Barrett . Later on , Barrett changed his mind and abandoned the idea .
