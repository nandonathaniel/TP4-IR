With reference to international agreements , `` every treaty in force is binding upon the parties to it and must be performed by them in good faith . '' Pacta sunt servanda is related to good faith , while pacta sunt servanda does not equate with good faith . This entitles states to require that obligations be respected and to rely upon the obligations being respected . This good faith basis of treaties implies that a party to the treaty can not invoke provisions of its municipal ( domestic ) law as justification for a failure to perform . However , with regards to the Vienna Convention and the UNIDROIT Principles it should be kept in mind that these are heavily influenced by civil law jurisdictions . To derive from these sources that pacta sunt servanda includes the principle of good faith is therefore incorrect .
