The Chargers coveted Eli Manning and wanted to select him with their first round pick , which was also the first overall pick of the draft . However , after Eli Manning indicated before the draft that he would not sign with the San Diego Chargers , they were forced to adjust their plans . Philip Rivers was their first alternative to Manning because the Chargers head coach at the time , Marty Schottenheimer , had coached Rivers at the Senior Bowl and he liked what he saw from Rivers . The Chargers agreed to a trade on draft day with the New York Giants . Manning was selected by the San Diego Chargers then later in the draft traded for Rivers , selected with the fourth pick by the Giants . The Chargers also received draft picks from the Giants that were used to select future Pro Bowlers Shawne Merriman and Nate Kaeding . Rivers was one of seventeen quarterbacks taken in the 2004 NFL Draft along with Ben Roethlisberger , Eli Manning , and Matt Schaub . Rivers , Roethlisberger , Schaub and Manning have been voted to the Pro Bowl since becoming starters , none had produced a season with a losing record until Schaub in 2010 , but Roethlisberger and Manning both have won two Super Bowls . They have been compared favorably to the Quarterback class of 1983 , which included Hall of Fame quarterbacks John Elway ( 1st pick ) , Jim Kelly ( 14th ) , and Dan Marino ( 27th ) .
