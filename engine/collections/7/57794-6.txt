Pressure vessels can theoretically be almost any shape , but shapes made of sections of spheres , cylinders , and cones are usually employed . A common design is a cylinder with end caps called heads . Head shapes are frequently either hemispherical or dished ( torispherical ) . More complicated shapes have historically been much harder to analyze for safe operation and are usually far more difficult to construct .
