After the arrival of the Europeans , some Iroquois became Christians , among them the first Native American Saint , Kateri Tekakwitha , a young woman of Mohawk - Algonquin parents . The Seneca sachem Handsome Lake , also known as Ganeodiyo , introduced a new religious system to the Iroquois in the late 18th century , which incorporated Quaker beliefs along with traditional Iroquoian culture . Handsome Lake 's teachings include a focus on parenting , appreciation of life , and peace . A key aspect of Handsome Lake 's teachings is the principle of equilibrium , wherein each person 's talents combined into a functional community . By the 1960s , at least 50 % of Iroquois followed this religion .
