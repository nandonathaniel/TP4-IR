Seven years later , a research study conducted by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety , a long - time advocate of the federal National Maximum Speed Law , showed Montana 's 75 mph speed limit on rural Interstates was well received by motorists ; traffic speed measurements taken by IIHS showed 76 percent of cars in compliance with 75 mph on those roads . IIHS also found large trucks subject to Montana 's unchanged 65 mph speed limit for large trucks on rural Interstates slowed down dramatically , from a mean speed of 70 mph in 1996 to 65 mph in 2006 , with the 85th percentile large truck speed dropping 11 mph , from 79 mph in 1996 to 68 mph in 2006 .
