Although Hong Kong ceased to be part of the Commonwealth of Nations in 1997 , the memorial service still resembles those in many other Commonwealth countries . The service includes the sounding of `` Last Post '' , two minutes of silence , the sounding of `` Reveille '' , the laying of wreaths , and prayers , and ends with a recitation of the `` Ode of Remembrance '' . The Hong Kong Police Band continues to perform their ceremonial duty at the service . Members of the Hong Kong Air Cadet Corps ( including the Ceremonial Squadron ) , Hong Kong Adventure Corps , Hong Kong Sea Cadet Corps and scouting organisations are also in attendance .
