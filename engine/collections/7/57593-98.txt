President Roosevelt lost the Court - packing battle , but he won the war for control of the Supreme Court ... not by any novel legislation , but by serving in office for more than twelve years , and appointing eight of the nine Justices of the Court . In this way the Constitution provides for ultimate responsibility of the Court to the political branches of government . ( Yet ) it was the United States Senate - a political body if there ever was one - who stepped in and saved the independence of the judiciary ... in Franklin Roosevelt 's Court - packing plan in 1937 .
