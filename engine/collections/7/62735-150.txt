Under Article 265 ( ex Article 232 ) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union , the Court of Justice and the General Court may also review the legality of a failure to act on the part of a Union institution . However , such an action may be brought only after the institution has been called on to act . Where the failure to act is held to be unlawful , it is for the institution concerned to put an end to the failure by appropriate measures .
