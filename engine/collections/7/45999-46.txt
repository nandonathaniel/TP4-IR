The establishment of George as a popular and protective saint in the West that had captured the medieval imagination was codified by the official elevation of his feast to a festum duplex at a church council in 1416 , on the date that had become associated with his martyrdom , 23 April . Wide latitude existed from community to community in celebration of the day across late medieval and early modern England , and no uniform `` national '' celebration elsewhere , a token of the popular and vernacular nature of George 's cultus and its local horizons , supported by a local guild or confraternity under George 's protection , or the dedication of a local church . When the English Reformation severely curtailed the saints ' days in the calendar , Saint George 's Day was among the holidays that continued to be observed .
