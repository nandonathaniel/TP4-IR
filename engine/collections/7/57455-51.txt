In 1974 , Gingrich made his first bid for political office as the Republican candidate in Georgia 's 6th congressional district , which stretched from the southern Atlanta suburbs to the Alabama state line . He lost to 20 - year incumbent Democrat Jack Flynt by 2,770 votes . Gingrich ran up huge margins in the suburban areas of the district , but was unable to overcome Flynt 's lead in the more rural areas . Gingrich 's relative success surprised political analysts . Flynt had never faced a serious challenger ; Gingrich was the second Republican to ever run against him . He did well against Flynt although 1974 was a disastrous year for Republican candidates nationally due to fallout from the Watergate scandal of the Nixon administration .
