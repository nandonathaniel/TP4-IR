The preference of the larvae of most lepidopteran species to feed on a single species or limited range of plants is used as a mechanism for biological control of weeds in place of herbicides . The pyralid cactus moth was introduced from Argentina to Australia , where it successfully suppressed millions of acres of prickly pear cactus . Another species of the Pyralidae , called the alligator weed stem borer ( Arcola malloi ) , was used to control the aquatic plant known as alligator weed ( Alternanthera philoxeroides ) in conjunction with the alligator weed flea beetle ; in this case , the two insects work in synergy and the weed rarely recovers .
