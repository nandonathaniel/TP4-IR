The Red River 's watershed covers 65,590 square miles ( 169,900 km ) and is the southernmost major river system in the Great Plains . Its drainage basin is mostly in the states of Texas and Oklahoma , but also covers parts of Arkansas and Louisiana . Its basin is characterized by flat , fertile agricultural land , with only a few major cities . The drainage basin of the Red River is very arid and receives little precipitation . As a result , much of the river above the Texas -- Oklahoma border is intermittent , and until the river is past its great bend south in Arkansas , the flow varies widely . Most of the agriculture in the basin is sustained by groundwater , which is recharged with rainfall and riverflow . The lower course of the river flows through a series of marshes and swamps , where its flow is dramatically moderated .
