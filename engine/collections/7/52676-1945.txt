You have presented a mischaracterization of the facts by cherry picking comments that favor your position and omitting those that do n't . You start by calling the TALK discussion an `` incident '' . You claim Grahamboat indicated that mentioning Miller `` did n't make sense in the lead '' -- `` without providing any explanation as to why '' but omit my reply - `` The Miller challenge was about whether a particular type of weapon , restricted under NFA , violated 2A . As such it was a minor and somewhat narrow 2A ruling because it did not explore the broad meaning of the 2A as Heller and McDonald did '' . You state Grahamboat said that I made an error while moving the text I caught the error within minutes and corrected it well before Grahamboat reverted the edit but did not bother to notice that after your second change the District of Columbia v. Heller section incorrectly read `` In 2008 and 2010 , the Supreme Court issued two Second Amendment decisions '' . Your use of the terms `` Heller controversy '' and `` legal theory '' indicate , to me , you are trying to disparage the SCOTUS ruling in Heller . Regarding Miller ; being `` relatively accurate and harmless '' are not grounds for inclusion in the lead . I did not see where any editor accused you of vandalism : it is paranoid to believe editors are conspiring against you by placing a Page Protection ( which I did not notice ) . You obviously do not understand what Page Protection is about .
