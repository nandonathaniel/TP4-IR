A field that specifies the length in bytes of the UDP header and UDP data . The minimum length is 8 bytes because that is the length of the header . The field size sets a theoretical limit of 65,535 bytes ( 8 byte header + 65,527 bytes of data ) for a UDP datagram . However the actual limit for the data length , which is imposed by the underlying IPv4 protocol , is 65,507 bytes ( 65,535 − 8 byte UDP header − 20 byte IP header ) .
