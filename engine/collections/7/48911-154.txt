There are many forms of criticism of Wundt 's psychology , of his apperception psychology , of his motivation theory , of his version of psychophysical parallelism with its concept of `` mental causality '' , his refutation of psychoanalytic speculation about the unconscious , or of his critical realism . A recurring criticism is that Wundt largely ignored the areas of psychology that he found less interesting , such as differential psychology , child psychology and educational psychology . In his cultural psychology there is no empirical social psychology because there were still no methods for investigating it at the time . Among his postgraduate students , assistants and other colleagues , however , were several important pioneers : differential rpsychology , `` mental measurement '' and intelligence testing ( James McKeen Cattell , Charles Spearman ) , social psychology of group pocesses and the psychology of work ( Walther Moede ) , applied psychology ( Ernst Meumann , Hugo MÃ¼nsterberg ) , psychopathology , psychopharmacology and clinical diagnosis ( Emil Kraepelin ) .
