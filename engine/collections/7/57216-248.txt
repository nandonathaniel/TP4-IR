Niall Ferguson argues that the U.S. is incorrectly blamed for all the human rights violations in nations they have supported . He writes that it is generally agreed that Guatemala was the worst of the US - backed regimes during the Cold War . However , the U.S. can not credibly be blamed for all the 200,000 deaths during the long Guatemalan Civil War . The U.S. Intelligence Oversight Board writes that military aid was cut for long periods because of such violations , that the U.S. helped stop a coup in 1993 , and that efforts were made to improve the conduct of the security services .
