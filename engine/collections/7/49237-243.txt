There were 2,800 fans in attendance and the show drew a 3.7 rating on TBS . The Patriots defeated the Fabulous Freebirds to win the WCW United States Tag Team Championship on August 12 , but the match did n't air yet , so the Freebirds were announced as the champions . Furthermore , the titles were not on the line , making it a non-title match . Larry Zbyszko pinned Bill Kazmaier .
