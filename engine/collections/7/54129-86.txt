The earliest cemeteries that can be classified as Anglo - Saxon are found in widely separate regions and are dated to the early 5th century . The exception is in Kent , where the density of cemeteries and artifacts suggest either an exceptionally heavy Anglo - Saxon settlement , or continued settlement beginning at an early date , or both . By the late 5th century there were additional Anglo - Saxon cemeteries , some of them adjacent to earlier ones , but with a large expansion in other areas , and now including the southern coast of Sussex .
