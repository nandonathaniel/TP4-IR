Kipling lived in India as a child , and most of the stories are evidently set there , though it is not entirely clear where . The Kipling Society notes that `` Seonee '' ( Seoni , in the central Indian state of Madhya Pradesh ) is mentioned several times , and that the first Mowgli story , `` In the Rukh '' , is set in a forest reserve somewhere in northern India . `` Mowgli 's Brothers '' was positioned in the Aravalli hills of Rajasthan ( northwestern India ) in an early manuscript , later changed to Seonee , and Bagheera treks from `` Oodeypore '' ( Udaipur ) , a journey of reasonable length to Aravalli but a long way from Seoni . Seoni has a tropical savanna climate , with a dry and a rainy season . This is drier than a monsoon climate and does not support tropical rainforest . Forested parks and reserves that claim to be associated with the stories include Kanha Tiger Reserve , Madhya Pradesh , and Pench National Park , near Seoni . However , Kipling never visited the area .
