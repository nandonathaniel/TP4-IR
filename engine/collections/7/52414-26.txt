The Truth in Lending Act was originally Title I of the Consumer Credit Protection Act , Pub. L. 90 -- 321 , 82 Stat. 146 , enacted May 29 , 1968 . The regulations implementing the statute , which are known as `` Regulation Z '' , are codified at 12 C.F.R. 226 . Most of the specific requirements imposed by TILA are found in Regulation Z , so a reference to the requirements of TILA usually refers to the requirements contained in Regulation Z , as well as the statute itself .
