The lead just needs a synopsis . What does it show / what happens . Only one sentence . The actual section needs to be a bit more indepth . You do n't need sources for a synopsis , as you 're explaining what happens . -- Calvin999 Are you sure we do n't need sources for synopsis ? Would that not be original research ? Look at any GA song / album article , for example . It 's impossible to source a synopsis for every video . As long as you are n't bias or fancrufty , it 's fine . Of course , branding and name - dropping would require sources . And if you can find any , then of course still use them . -- Calvin999 18 : 36 , 20 April 2016 ( UTC )
