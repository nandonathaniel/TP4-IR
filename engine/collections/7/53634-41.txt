Horner and Findley were both schoolboys at the time of the massacre but their accounts had glaring discrepancies . Findley believed the massacre was a planned event with more than just a motive to steal gold from the Chinese miners . He believed the arrested culprits wanted to eliminate the Chinese miners from the area as well , which they successfully accomplished . In contrast to most accounts , Findley only recalled 31 confirmed victims and there was no mention of a trial . On the other hand , Horner believed that the event was a spur of the moment event and affected 34 confirmed victims . The school boys initially only had intentions to steal horses but experienced difficulty crossing the river with the stolen horses . When the Chinese miners refused to loan their boats , the boys decided to take the boats by force .
