During the Iran - Iraq war , the CIA had backed both sides . The CIA had maintained a network of spies in Iran , but in 1989 a CIA mistake compromised every agent they had in there , and the CIA had no agents in Iraq . In the weeks before the Invasion of Kuwait the CIA downplayed the military buildup . During the war CIA estimates of Iraqi abilities and intentions flip - flopped and were rarely accurate . In one particular case , the DOD had asked the CIA to identify military targets to bomb . One target the CIA identified was an underground shelter . The CIA did n't know that it was a civilian bomb shelter . In a rare instance the CIA correctly determined that the coalition forces efforts were coming up short in their efforts to destroy SCUD missiles . Congress took away the CIA 's role in interpreting spy - satellite photos , putting the CIA 's satellite intelligence operations under the auspices of the military . The CIA created its office of military affairs , which operated as `` second - echelon support for the pentagon ... answering ... questions from military men ( like ) ' how wide is this road ? ' '' At the end of the war , the CIA reported that there could be an uprising against Saddam , based on intelligence gained from exiles . Former DI , and current President Bush called on the Shiites and Kurds to rise up against Saddam , while , at the same time , withdrawing any support against Saddam . Saddam crushed the uprisings brutally . After the war , Saddam 's nuclear program was discovered . The CIA had had no information about it .
