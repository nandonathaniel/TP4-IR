One reason for the increased popularity of expensive engagement rings is its relationship to human sexuality and the woman 's marriage prospects . In the United States , until the Great Depression , a man who broke off a marriage engagement could be sued for breach of promise . Monetary damages included actual expenses incurred in preparing for the wedding , plus damages for emotional distress and loss of other marriage prospects . Damages were greatly increased if the woman had engaged in sexual intercourse with her fianc√© . Beginning in 1935 , these laws were repealed or limited . However , the social and financial cost of a broken engagement was no less : marriage was the only financially sound option for most women , and if she was no longer a virgin , her prospects for a suitable future marriage were greatly decreased . The diamond engagement ring thus became a source of financial security for the woman .
