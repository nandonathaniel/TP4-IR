Indonesian Constitution does not mention referendums at all , and as such , referendums are not a part of Indonesian political practice . In 1985 , the People 's Consultative Assembly issued Law no . 5 / 1985 that officially recognized referendum as a legitimate political process in Indonesia , but revoked in 1999 by Law no . 6 / 1999 . According to explanation given in Law no . 6 / 1999 , referendum is not compatible with Indonesian doctrine of representative democracy , as on the fourth principles of the national ideology Pancasila , absence on mentions of referendums inside the national constitution also became another reason why was the referendum law revoked .
