In 1977 , British Airways and Singapore Airlines shared a Concorde for flights between London and Singapore International Airport at Paya Lebar via Bahrain . The aircraft , BA 's Concorde G - BOAD , was painted in Singapore Airlines livery on the port side and British Airways livery on the starboard side . The service was discontinued after three return flights because of noise complaints from the Malaysian government ; it could only be reinstated on a new route bypassing Malaysian airspace in 1979 . A dispute with India prevented Concorde from reaching supersonic speeds in Indian airspace , so the route was eventually declared not viable and discontinued in 1980 .
