The largest coastal gap is the Golden Gate at the entrance to San Francisco Bay which also communicates via the Bay with the Carquinez Strait and the Central Valley . As the city of San Francisco lies adjacent to the Golden Gate , it is often subject to the fog and low clouds blowing in on the marine layer . Even when the clouds are not present , the coolness of the marine layer exacerbated by the strong winds can chill the city even in mid-summer . Because of this , San Francisco is sometimes referred to as `` naturally air conditioned '' .
