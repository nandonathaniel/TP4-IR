Archives located in for - profit institutions are usually those owned by a private business . Examples of prominent business archives in the United States include Coca - Cola ( which also owns the separate museum World of Coca - Cola ) , Procter and Gamble , Motorola Heritage Services and Archives , and Levi Strauss & Co . These corporate archives maintain historic documents and items related to the history and administration of their companies . Business archives serve the purpose of helping their corporations maintain control over their brand by retaining memories of the company 's past . Especially in business archives , records management is separate from the historic aspect of archives . Workers in these types of archives may have any combination of training and degrees , from either a history or library background . These archives are typically not open to the public and only used by workers of the owner company , though some allow approved visitors by appointment . Business archives are concerned with maintaining the integrity of their company , and are therefore selective of how their materials may be used .
