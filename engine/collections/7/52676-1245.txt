Considering the text of the 2nd amendment is only 1 sentence and appeared to be buried within some muddle . The short text of amendment should have some emphasis . As all other amendment in the us constitution . A user named SMP0328 removed my cquote and claimed improper use . I disagree would like to discuss what is was labeled improper use of cquote use . My argument is this article is titled Second Amendment to the United States Constitution , and in fact the portion I cquote formatted is the short actual text . The rest of the article is history and a lot of political opinion . This a controversial topic , for example the Heller vs District of columbia section is rather large . This article as a whole may require a NPOV check. 0pen $0 urce ( talk ) 18 : 32 , 30 April 2011 ( UTC )
