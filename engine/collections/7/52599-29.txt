The flashing yellow arrow has an important safety advantage because it can be shown while the through signals on the same approach are red . The circular green can not do this because the circular green controls all vehicular movements , while the flashing yellow arrow only controls movement in the direction indicated . If oncoming traffic has a lagging protected left turn ( with circular green and green left turn arrow indications ) , the flashing yellow arrow can continue to flash to drivers turning left across the oncoming traffic , even though the straight - ahead signals are red . This indication avoids the yellow trap problem .
