Although Arnold 's poetry received only mixed reviews and attention during his lifetime , his forays into literary criticism were more successful . Arnold is famous for introducing a methodology of literary criticism somewhere between the historicist approach common to many critics at the time and the personal essay ; he often moved quickly and easily from literary subjects to political and social issues . His Essays in Criticism ( 1865 , 1888 ) , remains a significant influence on critics to this day , and his prefatory essay to that collection , `` The Function of Criticism at the Present Time '' , is one of the most influential essays written on the role of the critic in identifying and elevating literature -- even while admitting , `` The critical power is of lower rank than the creative . '' In one of his most famous essays on the topic , `` The Study of Poetry '' , Arnold wrote that , `` Without poetry , our science will appear incomplete ; and most of what now passes with us for religion and philosophy will be replaced by poetry '' . He considered the most important criteria used to judge the value of a poem were `` high truth '' and `` high seriousness '' . By this standard , Chaucer 's Canterbury Tales did not merit Arnold 's approval . Further , Arnold thought the works that had been proven to possess both `` high truth '' and `` high seriousness '' , such as those of Shakespeare and Milton , could be used as a basis of comparison to determine the merit of other works of poetry . He also sought for literary criticism to remain disinterested , and said that the appreciation should be of `` the object as in itself it really is . ''
