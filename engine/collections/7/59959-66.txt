In May 2017 , President Maduro proposed the 2017 Venezuelan Constituent Assembly election , which was later held on 30 July 2017 despite wide international condemnation . Upcoming presidential elections , which Maduro would most likely lose , have the possibility of being delayed from their planned dates under a new constitution since no timeline was given for the rewrite . The United States sanctioned President Maduro following the election , labeling him as a `` dictator '' , preventing him from entering the United States .
