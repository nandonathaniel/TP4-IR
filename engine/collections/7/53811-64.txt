By early February 2007 , a film adaptation of The Dark Tower series was in the works . J.J. Abrams , co-creator of the television series Lost , was said to be attached to produce and direct . Carlton Cuse and Damon Lindelof , who co-created Lost with Abrams , optioned The Dark Tower from King for a reported amount of $19 , a number that mysteriously recurs throughout the series . According to issue # 923 of Entertainment Weekly , King `` is an ardent supporter of ( Lost ) and trusts Abrams to translate his vision '' into a film franchise , with Lindelof being `` the leading candidate to write the screenplay for the first installment . '' It was around this time that Marvel Comics launched their graphic novel adaptation of The Dark Tower with The Dark Tower : The Gunslinger Born . Later , in March 2007 , Abrams noted in an interview with Wired that the project is `` something that we are just now talking about with Stephen , so it 's too early for me to say that we 're even officially doing it yet just because the thing is in the early stages of discussion .
