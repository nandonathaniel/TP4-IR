Derrickson emphasized a Trinity - like relationship between the sphere , Klaatu , and Gort . Klaatu is initially depicted as a radiant focus of sentient light . He is then depicted as a 7 - foot - tall ( 2.1 m ) gray `` walking womb '' shape which finally takes on a completely human appearance . The filmmakers conceived the transitional form because they pondered the idea of humans mistaking space suits for alien skin . Computer - generated imagery and practical effects achieved the transformation . Todd Masters ( Slither ) directed the creation of the alien form , using thermal plastic and silicone .
