Land - based steam engines could exhaust their steam to atmosphere , as feed water was usually readily available . Prior to and during World War I , the expansion engine dominated marine applications , where high vessel speed was not essential . It was , however , superseded by the British invention steam turbine where speed was required , for instance in warships , such as the dreadnought battleships , and ocean liners . HMS Dreadnought of 1905 was the first major warship to replace the proven technology of the reciprocating engine with the then - novel steam turbine .
