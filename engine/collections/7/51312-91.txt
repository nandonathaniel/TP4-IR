The Cape Flats ( Die Kaapse Vlakte in Afrikaans ) is an expansive , low - lying , flat Afrikaans - speaking area situated to the southeast of the central business district of Cape Town . From the 1950s the area became home to people the apartheid government designated as non-White and has been described by some as ' Apartheid 's dumping ground ' . Race - based legislation such as the Group Areas Act and pass laws either forced non-white people out of more central urban areas designated for white people and into government - built townships in the Flats or made living in the area illegal , forcing many people designated as Black and Coloured into informal settlements elsewhere in the Flats .
