Chester Nimitz said later , `` It was God 's mercy that our fleet was in Pearl Harbor on December 7 , 1941 . '' Nimitz believed if Kimmel had discovered the Japanese approach to Pearl Harbor , he would have sortied to meet them . With the American carriers absent and Kimmel 's battleships at a severe disadvantage to the Japanese carriers , the likely result would have been the sinking of the American battleships at sea in deep water , where they would have been lost forever with tremendous casualties ( up to twenty thousand dead ) , instead of in Pearl Harbor , where the crews could easily be rescued , and six battleships ultimately restored to duty . This was also the reaction of Joseph Rochefort , head of HYPO , when he remarked the attack was cheap at the price .
