Tea use spread to Japan about the sixth century AD . Tea became a drink of the religious classes in Japan when Japanese priests and envoys , sent to China to learn about its culture , brought tea to Japan . Ancient recordings indicate the first batch of tea seeds were brought by a priest named Saichō ( 最澄 , 767 -- 822 ) in 805 and then by another named Kūkai ( 空海 , 774 -- 835 ) in 806 . It became a drink of the royal classes when Emperor Saga ( 嵯峨 天皇 ) , the Japanese emperor , encouraged the growth of tea plants . Seeds were imported from China , and cultivation in Japan began .
