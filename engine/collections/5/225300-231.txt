The microscopic description in statistical mechanics is based on a model that analyzes a system into its fundamental particles of matter or into a set of classical or quantum - mechanical oscillators and considers the system as a statistical ensemble of microstates . As a collection of classical material particles , temperature is a measure of the mean energy of motion , called kinetic energy , of the particles , whether in solids , liquids , gases , or plasmas . The kinetic energy , a concept of classical mechanics , is half the mass of a particle times its speed squared . In this mechanical interpretation of thermal motion , the kinetic energies of material particles may reside in the velocity of the particles of their translational or vibrational motion or in the inertia of their rotational modes . In monatomic perfect gases and , approximately , in most gases , temperature is a measure of the mean particle kinetic energy . It also determines the probability distribution function of the energy . In condensed matter , and particularly in solids , this purely mechanical description is often less useful and the oscillator model provides a better description to account for quantum mechanical phenomena . Temperature determines the statistical occupation of the microstates of the ensemble . The microscopic definition of temperature is only meaningful in the thermodynamic limit , meaning for large ensembles of states or particles , to fulfill the requirements of the statistical model .
