Basil Rathbone read the entire short story in his Caedmon LP recording The Tales of Edgar Allan Poe ( early 1960s ) . Other audiobook recordings have featured Christopher Lee , Hurd Hatfield , Martin Donegan and Gabriel Byrne as readers . The story was adapted by George Lowther for a broadcast on the CBS Radio Mystery Theater ( January 10 , 1975 ) , starring Karl Swenson and Staats Cotsworth . A radio reading was performed by Winifred Phillips , with music she composed . The program was produced by Winnie Waldron as part of National Public Radio 's Tales by American Masters series . Eros Ramazzotti 's song `` Lettera al futuro '' ( `` Letter to the future '' ) , from his 1996 album Dove c'Ã¨ musica , retells the main events of the story in a simplified form , without mentioning any specific characters or names but vaguely connecting the plague mentioned in the story to AIDS , and concludes with the singer 's hope , addressed to an imaginary unborn child , that such events will not happen any longer in the future .
