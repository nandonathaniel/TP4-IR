In order to correctly identify the consequences of diversity on productivity and other ecosystem processes , many things must happen . First , it is imperative that scientists stop looking for a single relationship . It is obvious now from the models , the data , and the theory that there is no one overarching effect of diversity on productivity . Scientists must try to quantify the differences between composition effect and diversity effects , as many experiments never quantify the final realized species diversity ( instead only counting numbers of species of seeds planted ) and confound a sampling effect for facilitators ( a compositional factor ) with diversity effects .
