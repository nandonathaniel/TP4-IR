Cascades are fragile -- because agents receive no extra information after the difference between a and b increases beyond 2 , and because such differences can occur at small numbers of agents , agents considering opinions from those agents who are making decisions based on actual information can be dissuaded from a choice rather easily . thus suggests that cascades are susceptible to the release of public information . also discusses this result in the context of the underlying value p changing over time , in which case a cascade can rapidly change course .
