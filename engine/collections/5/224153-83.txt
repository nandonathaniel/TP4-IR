`` Yes , we shall see the international world revolution , but for the time being it is a very good fairy - tale , a very beautiful fairy - tale -- I quite understand children liking beautiful fairy - tales . But I ask , is it proper for a serious revolutionary to believe in fairy - tales ? There is an element of reality in every fairy - tale . If you told children fairy - tales in which the cock and the cat did not converse in human language they would not be interested . In the same way , ' if you tell the people that civil war will break out in Germany and also guarantee that instead of a clash with imperialism we shall have a field revolution on a world - wide scale , the people will say you are deceiving them . In doing this you will be overcoming the difficulties with which history has confronted us only in your own minds , by your own wishes . It will be a good thing if the German proletariat is able to take action . But have you measured it , have you discovered an instrument that will show that the German revolution will break out on such - and - such a day ? No , you do not know that , and neither do we . You are staking everything on this card . If the revolution breaks out , everything is saved . Of course ! But if it does not turn out as we desire , if it does not achieve victory tomorrow -- what then ? Then the masses will say to you , you acted like gamblers -- you staked everything on a fortunate turn of events that did not take place , you proved to be unequal to the situation that actually arose instead of the world revolution , which will inevitably come , but which has not yet reached maturity .
