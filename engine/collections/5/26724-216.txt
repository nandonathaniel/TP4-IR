The following day , 26 October , the Congress elected a new cabinet of Bolsheviks , pending the convocation of a Constituent Assembly . This basis for the new Soviet government was known as the Council ( Soviet ) of People 's Commissars ( Sovnarkom ) , with Lenin as leader . Lenin allegedly approved of the name , reporting that it `` smells of revolution '' . The cabinet quickly passed the Decree on Peace and the Decree on Land . This new government was also officially called `` provisional '' until the Assembly was dissolved . Posters were pinned on walls and fences by the Right Socialist Revolutionaries , describing the takeover as a `` crime against the motherland and revolution '' .
