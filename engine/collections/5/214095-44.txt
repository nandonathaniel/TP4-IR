`` When the Levee Breaks '' is probably the most subtle thing on ( the album ) as far as production goes , because each twelve bars has something new about it , though at first it might not be apparent . There 's a lot of different effects on there that , at the time , had never been used before . Phased vocals , a backwards echoed harmonica solo .
