By tradition , deposed monarchs who have not freely abdicated continue to use their monarchical titles as a courtesy for the rest of their lives . Hence , even after Constantine II ceased to be King of the Hellenes , it is still common to refer to the deposed king and his family as if they were still on the throne , as many European royal courts and households do in guest lists at royal weddings , as in Sweden in 2010 , Britain in 2011 and Luxembourg in 2012 . The Republic of Greece oppose the right of their deposed monarch and former royal family members to be referred to by their former titles or bearing a surname indicating royal status , and has enacted legislation which hinder acquisition of Greek citizenship unless those terms are met . The former king brought this issue , along with property ownership issues , before the European Court of Human Rights for alleged violations of the European Convention on Human Rights , but lost with respect to the name issue .
