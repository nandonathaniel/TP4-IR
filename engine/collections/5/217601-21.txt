An example of the usefulness of a celebrity 's reach can be shown in statistics taken from telegraph.co.uk regarding the world 's most followed Instagram celebrities . The most followed Instagram celebrity is Selena Gomez , with each post that she makes being viewed by all or most of her 132 million followers . Cristiano Ronaldo is 2nd , with 105 million followers , and Ariana Grande is 3rd with 116 million followers . A direct brand endorsement from one of these celebrities would be significant were they to post a picture with the company 's product encouraging their followers to go out and purchase it , and this is on Instagram alone . Imagine the effect of a celebrity posting an endorsement across all of their social media , ( Facebook , Instagram , Twitter , Snapchat , etc . ) . The reach that an A-list celebrity has possesses the ability to reach millions of potential consumers , and as a result can be an incredibly effective way to boost sales , or at the very least get a brand 's name out there in a wider audience than before .
