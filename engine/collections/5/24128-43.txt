State legislatures can impeach state officials , including governors . The court for the trial of impeachments may differ somewhat from the federal model -- in New York , for instance , the Assembly ( lower house ) impeaches , and the State Senate tries the case , but the members of the seven - judge New York State Court of Appeals ( the state 's highest , constitutional court ) sit with the senators as jurors as well . Impeachment and removal of governors has happened occasionally throughout the history of the United States , usually for corruption charges . A total of at least eleven U.S. state governors have faced an impeachment trial ; a twelfth , Governor Lee Cruce of Oklahoma , escaped impeachment conviction by a single vote in 1912 . Several others , most recently Alabama 's Robert J. Bentley , have resigned rather than face impeachment , when events seemed to make it inevitable . The most recent impeachment of a state governor occurred on January 14 , 2009 , when the Illinois House of Representatives voted 117 -- 1 to impeach Rod Blagojevich on corruption charges ; he was subsequently removed from office and barred from holding future office by the Illinois Senate on January 29 . He was the eighth U.S. state governor to be removed from office .
