Due to the bialphabetic nature of the language , actual physical keyboards with the Serbian Cyrillic layout printed on the keys are uncommon today . Typical keyboards sold in Serbian - speaking markets are marked with Serbian Latin characters and used with both the Latin ( QWERTZ ) and Cyrillic layout configured in the software . What makes the two layouts this readily interchangeable is that the non-alphabetic keys are identical between them , and alphabetic keys always correspond directly to their counterparts ( except the Latin letters Q , W , X , and Y that have no Cyrillic equivalents , and the Cyrillic letters Љ , Њ and Џ whose Latin counterparts are digraphs LJ , NJ and DŽ ) . This also makes the Serbian Cyrillic layout a rare example of a non-Latin layout based on QWERTZ .
