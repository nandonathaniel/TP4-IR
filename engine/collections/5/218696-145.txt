On the Sneak Previews special `` Oscar Preview for 1978 '' , Roger Ebert correctly predicted that The Deer Hunter would win for Best Picture while Gene Siskel predicted that Coming Home would win . However , Ebert incorrectly guessed that Robert De Niro would win for Best Actor for Deer Hunter and Jill Clayburgh would win for Best Actress for An Unmarried Woman while Siskel called the wins for Jon Voight as Best Actor and Jane Fonda as Best Actress , both for Coming Home . Both Ebert and Siskel called the win for Christopher Walken receiving the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor .
