The song is then stripped back down to acoustic guitar , droning on the Dm9 chord , with the bass softly striking E , the ninth of the chord , in the same range as the guitar 's lowest note , D. Another slash chord movement follows , B ♭ to C / B ♭ , followed by the key 's dominant , A Major , with the minor sixth heard first at the top of the chord , in an A ( add ♭ 6 ) , and later , as its bass note ( in a progression of A , A / F , A / E , to D minor ) . After another guitar solo over the new progression , Gilmour sings a melismatic vocal with overdubbed harmonies from Richard Wright , ending with the lyric `` Have a good drown / As you go down / All alone / Dragged down by the stone '' , as the dissonant A / F leads back to Dm9 .
