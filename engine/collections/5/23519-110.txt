One of the harshest negative reviews came from HitFix , on Daniel Fienberg and Alan Sepinwall 's podcast , where Fienberg called the premiere episode `` awful , just horrible ... as bad as The Walking Dead has ever gotten at its very worst . This is that bad . I 've been kind of stunned to see people being generous to it ... I thought this was almost unwatchably bad . '' Sepinwall called his B âˆ’ review `` slightly generous '' .
