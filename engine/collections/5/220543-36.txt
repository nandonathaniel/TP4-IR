Born in Rotterdam , Van Persie joined the youth squad of local side SBV Excelsior when he was five , but left for Feyenoord at the age of 16 after falling out with the Excelsior coaching staff over his `` petulant '' attitude . An injury crisis at Feyenoord meant he was quickly promoted into the first team , and made his debut for the club at 17 , the first of 15 total starts during the 2001 -- 02 season . After starting for Feyenoord in the final of the UEFA Cup , Van Persie received the KNVB Best Young Talent award .
