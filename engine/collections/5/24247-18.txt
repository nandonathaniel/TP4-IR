The Mexican game of Conquian is considered by games scholar David Parlett to be ancestral to all rummy games , which itself is derived from a Chinese game called Khanhoo and , going further back , Mahjong . The Rummy principle of drawing and discarding with a view to melding appears in Chinese card games at least in the early 19th century , and perhaps as early as the 18th century , and is the essence of Mahjong .
