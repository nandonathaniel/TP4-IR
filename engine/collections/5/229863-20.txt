By the mid-19th century , there were three separate ferry companies offering services between lower Manhattan and the eastern shore of Staten Island . The Tompkins and Staples Ferry , operated by Vice President Tompkins 's son Minthorne , ran from a pier at the Tompkinsville end of the highway to Whitehall Street in lower Manhattan . The New York and Staten Island Steam Ferry Company , or `` People 's Ferry '' , was operated by George Law and ran from Stapleton , Staten Island , to Liberty Street , Manhattan . Finally , the Richmond Turnpike Ferry , also the `` Staten Island Ferry '' , ran from Vanderbilt 's Landing , on Clifton , Staten Island , to Manhattan . All of these companies merged in 1853 after Vanderbilt , who was focused on business ventures elsewhere , convinced Law and Tompkins to buy out his ferry company for $600,000 . Vanderbilt remained a dominant figure in the ferry until the Civil War in the early 1860s .
