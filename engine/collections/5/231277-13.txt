The emblem of the Bearers element was created by an unidentified Bearer in 2000 . Symbolically , the emblem represents a casket draped with an American flag , flanked on both sides by eight stars which represent the number of body bearers required for a funeral with full military honors and the use of a caisson . The motto `` Last To Let You Down '' represents the loyalty and honor that the Bearers element accords to a fallen service member as well as literally letting ( setting ) the casket of the deceased down at the gravesite .
