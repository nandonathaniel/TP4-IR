Reimiro , a gorget or breast ornament of crescent shape with a head at one or both tips . The same design appears on the flag of Rapa Nui . Two Rei Miru at the British Museum are inscribed with Rongorongo . Moko Miro , a man with a lizard head . The Moko Miro was used as a club because of the legs , which formed a handle shape . If it was n't held by hand , dancers wore it around their necks during feasts . The Moko Miro would also be placed at the doorway to protect the household from harm . It would be hanging from the roof or set in the ground . The original form had eyes made from white shells , and the pupils were made of obsidian . Moai kavakava are male carvings and the Moai Paepae are female carvings . These grotesque and highly detailed human figures carved from Toromiro pine , represent ancestors . Sometimes these statues were used for fertility rites . Usually , they are used for harvest celebrations ; `` the first picking of fruits was heaped around them as offerings '' . When the statues were not used , they would be wrapped in bark cloth and kept at home . There were a few times that are reported when the islanders would pick up the figures like dolls and dance with them . The earlier figures are rare and generally depict a male figure with an emaciated body and a goatee . The figures ' ribs and vertebrae are exposed and many examples show carved glyphs on various parts of the body but more specifically , on the top of the head . The female figures , rarer than the males , depict the body as flat and often with the female 's hand lying across the body . The figures , although some were quite large , were worn as ornamental pieces around a tribesman 's neck . The more figures worn , the more important the man . The figures have a shiny patina developed from constant handling and contact with human skin . Ao , a large dancing paddle
