High school senior Buffy Summers ( Kristy Swanson ) is introduced as a stereotypical `` popular girl '' at Hemery High School in Los Angeles whose main concerns are shopping and spending time with her rich , snooty friends and her boyfriend , Jeffrey . While at school one day , she is approached by a man who calls himself Merrick ( Donald Sutherland ) . He informs her that she is The Slayer , or Chosen One , destined to kill vampires , and he is a Watcher whose duty it is to guide and train her . She initially rebukes his claims , but is convinced that he is right when he is able to describe a recurring dream of hers in detail . In addition , Buffy is exhibiting uncanny abilities not known to her , including heightened agility , senses , and endurance , yet she repeatedly tries Merrick 's patience with her frivolous nature , indifference to slaying and sharp - tongued remarks .
