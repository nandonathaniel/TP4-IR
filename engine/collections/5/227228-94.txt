Work is being done in developing ceramic parts for gas turbine engines . Currently , even blades made of advanced metal alloys used in the engines ' hot section require cooling and careful limiting of operating temperatures . Turbine engines made with ceramics could operate more efficiently , giving aircraft greater range and payload for a set amount of fuel .
