The channel would later expand its beach - themed events to the summer , dedicating most of each summer season to broadcasting live from a beach house at various locations away from New York City , eventually leading to channel - wide branding throughout the summer in the 1990s and early 2000s such as Motel California , Summer Share , Isle of MTV , SoCal Summer , Summer in the Keys , and Shore Thing . MTV VJs would host blocks of music videos , interview artists and bands , and introduce live performances and other programs from the beach house location each summer . In the 2000s , as the channel reduced its airtime for music videos and eliminated much of its in - house programming , its annual summer - long events came to an end .
