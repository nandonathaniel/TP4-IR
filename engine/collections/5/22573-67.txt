In the review `` Using The Absolutely True Diary of a Part - Time Indian to Teach About Racial Formation '' , Miami University professor Kevin Talbert says that Alexie chose to narrate the story through the eyes of fourteen - year - old Junior to transport his readers into `` uncomfortable or incongruent spaces . '' He continues to say that the novel 's writing allows for topics about class and racial struggles to be intertwined with more common adolescent struggles like sexual desires , controlling hormones , and managing relationships with friends and family . Furthermore , Talbert believes that , unlike other Young Adult novels , this book captures issues of race and class in a way that reaches a wider audience . The article also states that Junior 's narration in the novel sends a message to society , `` that adolescents have important things to say , that being fourteen years old matters . ''
