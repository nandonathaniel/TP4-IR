Spain 's colonization of mainland Venezuela started in 1522 , establishing its first permanent South American settlement in the present - day city of Cuman√° . In the 16th century , Venezuela was contracted as a concession by the King of Spain to the German Welser banking family ( Klein - Venedig , 1528 -- 1546 ) . Native caciques ( leaders ) such as Guaicaipuro ( circa 1530 -- 1568 ) and Tamanaco ( died 1573 ) attempted to resist Spanish incursions , but the newcomers ultimately subdued them ; Tamanaco was put to death by order of Caracas ' founder , Diego de Losada .
