Overall unified system memory architecture has been improved , with the addition of another 1GB segment of DDR3 DRAM . The PS4 Pro is able to use this increase in memory to swap out non-gaming applications that run in the background , like Netflix and Spotify . As a side benefit to this , an additional 512MB of GDDR5 is available for developers to use for games adding up to 5.5 GB , as opposed to the 5GB available on base PS4 hardware . GDDR5 memory speed was increased from 5.5 Gbit / s ( or 4x 1.375 GHz ) to 6.8 Gbit / s ( or 4x 1.7 GHz ) increasing total memory bandwidth to 217.6 GB / s which correlates to a 23.8 % improvement .
