The 1990s saw a boom in Australian - made drama , which included Halifax f.p. , Stingers , Water Rats , SeaChange , All Saints , and the long running police drama Blue Heelers which ran from 1993 to 2006 , one of the longest running Australian programs , equaling Homicide 's record of 510 episodes ; a record set two decades earlier . A number of successful comedy programs also aired during the 1990s , including Fast Forward , Full Frontal , The Late Show and Good News Week . Hey Hey It 's Saturday ended its 28 - year run in November 1999. One of the most significant developments in terms of high quality Australian programming was the establishment by the Federal Government of the Commercial Television Production Fund .
