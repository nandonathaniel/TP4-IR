The Navajo were an Athabaskan people who migrated from the north into the Colorado River basin around 1025 A.D. They soon established themselves as the dominant Native American tribe in the Colorado River basin , and their territory stretched over parts of present - day Arizona , New Mexico , Utah and Colorado -- in the original homelands of the Puebloans . In fact , the Navajo acquired agricultural skills from the Puebloans before the collapse of the Pueblo civilization in the 14th century . A profusion of other tribes have made a continued , lasting presence along the Colorado River . The Mohave have lived along the rich bottomlands of the lower Colorado below Black Canyon since 1200 A.D. They were fishermen -- navigating the river on rafts made of reeds to catch Gila trout and Colorado pikeminnow -- and farmers , relying on the annual floods of the river rather than irrigation to water their crops . Ute peoples have inhabited the northern Colorado River basin , mainly in present - day Colorado , Wyoming and Utah , for at least 2,000 years , but did not become well established in the Four Corners area until 1500 A.D. The Apache , Cocopah , Halchidhoma , Havasupai , Hualapai , Maricopa , Pima , and Quechan are among many other groups that live along or had territories bordering on the Colorado River and its tributaries .
