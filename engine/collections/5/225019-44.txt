Back in Germany , Dimitri and Reznov pilot a T - 34 tank , pushing through the last Nazi lines so the Soviet troops can board a train to Berlin . Upon arrival , they engage German soldiers on the outskirts of Berlin , commencing the Battle of Berlin . They then advance through the streets , eventually reaching the entrance of a Berlin U-Bahn station , where three German soldiers are attempting to surrender . Reznov is unwilling to allow the men to live and gives Dimitri the choice of shooting them or burning them alive with molotov cocktails . They head into the underground and start fighting German soldiers around the platforms , until a sudden surge of water fills the tunnel . Dimitri , unable to avoid the oncoming tidal wave , almost drowns .
