Derrida states that deconstruction is not an analysis , a critique , or a method in the traditional sense that philosophy understands these terms . In these negative descriptions of deconstruction , Derrida is seeking to `` multiply the cautionary indicators and put aside all the traditional philosophical concepts '' . This does not mean that deconstruction has absolutely nothing in common with an analysis , a critique , or a method , because while Derrida distances deconstruction from these terms , he reaffirms `` the necessity of returning to them , at least under erasure '' . Derrida 's necessity of returning to a term under erasure means that even though these terms are problematic we must use them until they can be effectively reformulated or replaced . The relevance of the tradition of negative theology to Derrida 's preference for negative descriptions of deconstruction is the notion that a positive description of deconstruction would over-determine the idea of deconstruction and would close off the openness that Derrida wishes to preserve for deconstruction . If Derrida were to positively define deconstruction -- as , for example , a critique -- then this would make the concept of critique immune to itself being deconstructed . Some new philosophy beyond deconstruction would then be required in order to encompass the notion of critique .
