After Hasan 's accidental death in February 1823 , another son - in - law of Muhammad Ali of Egypt , Hussein Bey , led a well - organised and well - armed joint Turkish - Egyptian force of 12,000 soldiers with the support of artillery and cavalry . On 22 June 1823 , Emmanouil Tombazis , appointed Commissioner of Crete by the Greek revolutionary government , held the Convention of Arcoudaina in an attempt to reconcile the factions of local captains and unite them against the common threat . He then gathered 3,000 men in Gergeri to face Hussein , but the Cretans were defeated by the much larger and better - organised force , and lost 300 men at the battle of Amourgelles on 20 August 1823 . By the spring of 1824 , Hussein had managed to limit the Cretan resistance to just a few mountain enclaves .
