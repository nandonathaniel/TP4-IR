The Hercules moth ( Coscinocera hercules ) , in the family Saturniidae , is endemic to New Guinea and northern Australia , and its wings have the largest documented surface area ( 300 square centimeters ) of any living insect , and a maximum wingspan which is confirmed to 28 cm ( 11 in ) while unconfirmed specimens have spanned up to 35.5 cm ( 14.0 in ) . The largest species overall is often claimed to be either the Queen Alexandra 's birdwing ( Ornithoptera alexandrae ) , a butterfly from Papua New Guinea , or the Atlas moth ( Attacus atlas ) , a moth from Southeast Asia . Both of these species can reach a length of 8 cm ( 3.1 in ) , a wingspan of 28 cm ( 11 in ) and a weight of 12 g ( 0.42 oz ) . One Atlas moth allegedly had a wingspan of 30 cm ( 12 in ) but this measurement was not verified . The larvae in the previous species can weigh up to 58 and 54 g ( 2.0 and 1.9 oz ) , respectively . However , there are no reported measurements of surface area that would exceed the Hercules moth , and the white witch ( Thysania agrippina ) of Central and South America , has the largest recorded wingspan of the order , and indeed of any living insect , though the white witch is exceeded in surface area by the Hercules moth . The verified record - sized Thysania spanned 30.8 cm ( 12.1 in ) across the wings , although specimens have been reported to 36 cm ( 14 in ) . The heaviest mature moths have been cited in the giant carpenter moth ( Xyleutes boisduvali ) of Australia , which has weighed up to 20 g ( 0.71 oz ) although the species does not surpass 25.5 cm ( 10.0 in ) in wingspan .
