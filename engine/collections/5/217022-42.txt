In all games from the second onwards , the player will gain access to a series of ( predominantly 8 - bit ) minigames , sometimes randomly after death , as in the second game , and sometimes once the player has completed a specific task . These minigames usually tell a story or event relevant to the game 's lore , although mostly presented in a cryptic way . For example , minigames in Five Nights at Freddy 's 2 are speculated to portray the homicidal incidents previously mentioned in the games . Minigames in Five Nights at Freddy 's 4 tell the story of a character , possibly the player character , who dies in a tragic accident .
