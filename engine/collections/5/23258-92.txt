The distribution of slums within a city varies throughout the world . In most of the developed countries , it is easier to distinguish the slum - areas and non-slum areas . In the United States , slum dwellers are usually in city neighborhoods and inner suburbs , while in Europe , they are more common in high rise housing on the urban outskirts . In many developing countries , slums are prevalent as distributed pockets or as urban orbits of densely constructed informal settlements . In some cities , especially in countries in Southern Asia and sub-Saharan , slums are not just marginalized neighborhoods holding a small population ; slums are widespread , and are home to a large part of urban population . These are sometimes called slum cities .
