In 1973 , Britain entered the European Common Market , stepping away from imperial and commonwealth trade ties . Inflation and unemployment contributed to a growing sense of economic decline - partly offset by the exploitation of North Sea Oil from 1974 . In 1979 , the electorate turned to Conservative Party leader Margaret Thatcher , who became Britain 's first female prime minister . Thatcher launched a radical program of economic reform and remained in power for over a decade . In 1982 , Thatcher dispatched a British fleet to the Falkland Islands which successfully repelled an Argentine invasion of the British Territory , demonstrating that Britain could still project power across the globe .
