However , the United Kingdom sometimes experiences an ' Indian Summer ' , where temperatures particularly by night can be very mild and rarely fall below 10 ° C ( 50 ° F ) . Such events are aided by the surrounding Atlantic Ocean and seas being at their warmest , keeping the country in warm air , despite the relatively weak sun . Examples of this were in 1985 , 1999 , 2005 , 2006 , 2011 and 2016 where September saw above average temperatures which felt more like a continuation of summer than autumn . Autumns since 2000 have generally been very mild with notable extremes of precipitation ; the UK has seen some of its wettest and driest autumns since the millennium. 2011 and 2016 were notable as many areas of the country recorded their highest temperatures of the year in September and October ( for example , 28.2 ° C at Hawarden on 1 October , 26.3 ° C at St. Athan on 2 October 2011 and the UK 's highest temperature of 2016 on 13 September with 34.4 ° C at Gravesend ) .
