The Confederates ' new line was much stronger and more compact than the first day 's line . It was anchored on the east on Peach Orchard Hill . The western flank ran along a line of hills leading south from Compton 's Hill , which after the day 's battle would be called Shy 's Hill after Col. William M. Shy , the Confederate officer commanding the 20th Tennessee Infantry , who died defending it . The center followed a series of sturdy dry stack stone walls enhanced by entrenching .
