Sometime between the ages of seven and nine , Handel accompanied his father to Weissenfels where he came under the notice of one whom Handel thereafter always regarded throughout life as his benefactor , Duke Johann Adolf I. Somehow Handel made his way to the court organ in the palace chapel of the Holy Trinity , where he surprised everyone with his playing . Overhearing this performance and noting the youth of the performer caused the Duke , whose suggestions were not to be disregarded , to recommend to Georg HÃ¤ndel that Handel be given musical instruction . Handel 's father engaged the organist at the Halle parish church , the young Friedrich Wilhelm Zachow , to instruct Handel . Zachow would be the only teacher that Handel ever had . Because of his church employment , Zachow was an organist `` of the old school '' , reveling in fugues , canons and counterpoint . But he was also familiar with developments in music across Europe and his own compositions `` embraced the new concerted , dramatic style '' . When Zachow discovered the talent of Handel , he introduced him `` to a vast collection of German and Italian music , which he possessed , sacred and profane , vocal and instrumental compositions of different schools , different styles , and of every master '' . Many traits considered `` Handelian '' can be traced back to Zachow 's music . At the same time Handel continued practice on the harpsichord , learned violin and organ , but according to Burney his special affection was for the hautbois ( oboe ) . Schoelcher speculates that his youthful devotion to the instrument explains the large number of pieces he composed for oboe .
