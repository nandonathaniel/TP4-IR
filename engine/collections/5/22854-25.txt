Today , the Indian plate continues to be driven horizontally at the Tibetan Plateau , which forces the plateau to continue to move upwards . The Indian plate is still moving at 67 mm per year , and over the next 10 million years it will travel about 1,500 km into Asia . About 20 mm per year of the India - Asia convergence is absorbed by thrusting along the Himalaya southern front . This leads to the Himalayas rising by about 5 mm per year , making them geologically active . The movement of the Indian plate into the Asian plate also makes this region seismically active , leading to earthquakes from time to time .
