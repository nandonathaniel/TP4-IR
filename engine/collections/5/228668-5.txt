All four fundamental forces are believed to be related , and to unite into a single force at high energies on a minuscule scale , the Planck scale , but particle accelerators can not produce the enormous energies required to experimentally probe this . Efforts to devise a common theoretical framework that would explain the relation between the forces are perhaps the greatest goal of theoretical physicists today . The weak and electromagnetic forces have already been unified with the electroweak theory of Sheldon Glashow , Abdus Salam , and Steven Weinberg for which they received the 1979 Nobel Prize in physics . Progress is currently being made in uniting the electroweak and strong fields within a Grand Unified Theory ( GUT ) . A bigger challenge is to find a way to quantize the gravitational field , resulting in a theory of quantum gravity ( QG ) which would unite gravity in a common theoretical framework with the other three forces . Some theories , notably string theory , seek both QG and GUT within one framework , unifying all four fundamental interactions along with mass generation within a theory of everything ( ToE ) .
