The ice cream parlor actually owns several locations , but most of them are in the Springfield Mall . They serve , indeed , 5600 flavors , with their premier item being `` The Ark '' , a gigantic sundae featuring all the stores flavors , 26 sauces , toppings and nuts . In `` You Kent Always Say What You Want '' , Homer purchased the 1.000. 000th ice - cream cone ( though briefly lost the prize because he couldnt decide between a cup or a cone ) , and won a special interview with Kent Brockman .
