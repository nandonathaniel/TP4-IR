The work on interpretation and analysis of genome data is still in its initial stages . It is anticipated that detailed knowledge of the human genome will provide new avenues for advances in medicine and biotechnology . Clear practical results of the project emerged even before the work was finished . For example , a number of companies , such as Myriad Genetics , started offering easy ways to administer genetic tests that can show predisposition to a variety of illnesses , including breast cancer , hemostasis disorders , cystic fibrosis , liver diseases and many others . Also , the etiologies for cancers , Alzheimer 's disease and other areas of clinical interest are considered likely to benefit from genome information and possibly may lead in the long term to significant advances in their management .
