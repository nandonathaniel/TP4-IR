The modern Ottawa Senators entered the NHL in 1992 , but the rivalry between the two teams did not begin to emerge until the late 1990s . From 1992 to 1998 , Ottawa and Toronto played in different conferences ( Eastern and Western respectively ) , which meant they rarely played each other . However , before the 1998 -- 99 season , the conferences and divisions were realigned , with Toronto moved to the Eastern Conference 's Northeast Division with Ottawa . From 2000 to 2004 , the teams played four post-season series ; the Leafs won all four playoff series . Due in part to the number Leafs fans living in the Ottawa Valley , and in part to Ottawa 's proximity to Toronto , Leafs - Senators games at the Canadian Tire Centre in Ottawa hold a more neutral audience .
