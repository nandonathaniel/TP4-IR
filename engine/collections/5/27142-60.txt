The Australian film industry has been responsible for many decent films for decades ( and some utter crap , of course ) , but the percentage with international appeal is quite small . That is changing , and it is films such as The Man From Snowy River that have ensured ongoing interest . The film was inspired by the ' Banjo ' Paterson poem of the same name , and stars numerous respected local talents and a Hollywood big name star in Kirk Douglas , playing two roles . The two standouts of this film are the majestic mountain scenery , and the final chase scenes with that awe - inspiring horse ride down the mountainside . The film stars many big names and familiar faces including Gus Mercurio ( Paul 's father ) , Lorraine Bayley ( The Sullivans ) , Tony Bonner ( Skippy ) and Chris Haywood . The sets and costumes are also great , the script is strong , and the various threads that run through the film are well handled .
