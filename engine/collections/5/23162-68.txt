`` Good Night '' was a lullaby written by Lennon for his son Julian , and he specifically wanted Starr to sing it . The early takes featured just Lennon on acoustic guitar and Starr singing . Martin scored an orchestral and choral arrangement that replaced the guitar in the final mix , and also played the celesta .
