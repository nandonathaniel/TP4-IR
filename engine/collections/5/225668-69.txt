Further to the perceived need for an indigenous , regional court as a tribunal of last resort in civil and criminal cases , other factors eventually led to the strong support for the creation of a judicial arm of the CARICOM . In 1972 consideration was being given by the OCCBA for the proposed Caribbean Court of Appeal to serve as both a municipal court of last resort and an international tribunal to adjudicate disputes between CARICOM member states . In 1989 the West Indian Commission established by the CARICOM heads of government endorsed this proposed hybrid jurisdiction without qualification . As Duke Pollard , then director of the Caricom Legislative Drafting Facility , wrote in 2000 : `` the old Treaty of Chaguaramas provided for arbitration in the event of disputes concerning the interpretation and application of the Treaty . Unfortunately , however , the arbitral procedure was never used and serious disputes were never settled , thereby causing the integration movement to be hampered . Moreover , the rights and obligations created by the CSME are so important and extensive , relating to the establishment of economic enterprises , the provision of professional services , the movement of capital , the acquisition of land for the operation of businesses , that there is a clear need to have a permanent , central , regional institution to authoritatively and definitively pronounce on those rights and corresponding obligations . The Caribbean Court of Justice is intended to be such an authoritative institution . ''
