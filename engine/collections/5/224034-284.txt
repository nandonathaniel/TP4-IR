In 2008 , Rowan Williams , the Archbishop of Canterbury , has suggested that Islamic and Orthodox Jewish courts should be integrated into the British legal system alongside ecclesiastical courts to handle marriage and divorce , subject to agreement of all parties and strict requirements for protection of equal rights for women . His reference to the sharia sparked a controversy . Later that year , Nicholas Phillips , then Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales , stated that there was `` no reason why sharia principles ( ... ) should not be the basis for mediation or other forms of alternative dispute resolution . '' A 2008 YouGov poll in the United Kingdom found 40 % of Muslim students interviewed supported the introduction of sharia into British law for Muslims . Michael Broyde , professor of law at Emory University specializing in alternative dispute resolution and Jewish law , has argued that sharia courts can be integrated into the American religious arbitration system , provided that they adopt appropriate institutional requirements as American rabbinical courts have done .
