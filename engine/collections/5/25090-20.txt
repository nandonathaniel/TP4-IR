During the first player auctions for the inaugural IPL season conducted in January 2008 , the Chennai franchise bought a number of contemporary star cricketers such as Mahendra Singh Dhoni , Matthew Hayden , Stephen Fleming , Muttiah Muralitharan and Michael Hussey . Dhoni became the costliest player of the auction , as the Chennai franchise bought him for $1.5 million . The franchise named Dhoni as the captain of the team and appointed Kepler Wessels as the head coach . They played their first game on 19 April 2008 against Kings XI Punjab at Mohali . The Super Kings won the game by 33 runs after posting 240 / 5 in 20 overs , which was the highest total of the tournament , a record surpassed by themselves in 2010 . The Super Kings ended the league stage with eight wins from 14 games and finished third on the points table . They beat the Kings XI Punjab by 9 wickets in the semifinal . The Super Kings faced the Rajasthan Royals in the final of the IPL at Mumbai . Batting first , the Super Kings scored 163 / 5 in 20 overs and lost the game by 3 wickets off the final delivery of the match . They also earned a spot in the inaugural Champions League Twenty20 along with Rajasthan , but the tournament was cancelled due to the 2008 Mumbai Attacks and the Super Kings , along with Rajasthan , received $5 million each as compensation . Fleming , who had decided to retire from all forms of the game after the first season of the IPL , took over as the coach of the Super Kings team from Wessels for the next season which was to be held in South Africa .
