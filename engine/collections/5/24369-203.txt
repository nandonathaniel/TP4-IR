New Zealand citizenship by descent could be obtained only from a father , not the mother ( however those born between 1949 and 1977 to a New Zealand mother may be able to register now as New Zealand citizens ) . Where the father was a New Zealand citizen by descent , the child normally had to be registered as a New Zealand citizen before age 16 .
