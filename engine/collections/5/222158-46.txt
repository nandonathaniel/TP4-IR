News of the expedition reached Britain on the day of Queen Elizabeth II 's coronation , and the press called the successful ascent a coronation gift . In return , the 37 members of the party received the Queen Elizabeth II Coronation Medal with MOUNT EVEREST EXPEDITION engraved on the rim . The group was surprised by the international acclaim they received upon arriving in Kathmandu . Hillary and Hunt were knighted by the young queen , while Tenzing -- ineligible for knighthood as a Nepalese citizen -- received the George Medal from the British Government for his efforts with the expedition .
