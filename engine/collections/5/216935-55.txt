The layers of the adrenal gland differ by function , with each layer having distinct enzymes that produce different hormones from a common precursor . The first enzymatic step in the production of all steroid hormones is cleavage of the cholesterol side chain , a reaction that forms pregnenolone as a product and is catalyzed by the enzyme P450scc , also known as cholesterol desmolase . After the production of pregnenolone , specific enzymes of each cortical layer further modify it . Enzymes involved in this process include both mitochondrial and microsomal P450s and hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases . Usually a number of intermediate steps in which pregnenolone is modified several times are required to form the functional hormones . Enzymes that catalyze reactions in these metabolic pathways are involved in a number of endocrine diseases . For example , the most common form of congenital adrenal hyperplasia develops as a result of deficiency of 21 - hydroxylase , an enzyme involved in an intermediate step of cortisol production .
