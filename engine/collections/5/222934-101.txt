In United States v. Leon , the Court established the `` good faith '' exception to the rule , ruling that evidence seized by officers reasonably relying on a warrant was still admissible , even though the warrant was later found to be defective , unless an officer dishonestly or recklessly prepared an affidavit to seek a warrant , the issuing magistrate abandoned his neutrality , or the warrant lacked sufficient particularity . The Court determined in Nix v. Williams that `` fruit of the poisonous tree '' evidence could still be introduced if a prosecutor could demonstrate that it would have been an `` inevitable discovery '' of legitimate investigation . In Segura v. United States , the Court ruled that evidence illegally found without a search warrant is admissible if the evidence is later found and legally seized based on information independent of the illegal search .
