Regardless of the details of the chemical discoveries , tetraethyl lead remained unimportant commercially until the 1920s . In 1921 , at the direction of DuPont Corporation , which manufactured TEL , it was found to be an effective antiknock agent by Thomas Midgley , working under Charles Kettering at General Motors Corporation Research . General Motors patented the use of TEL as an antiknock agent and used the name `` Ethyl '' that had been proposed by Kettering in its marketing materials , thereby avoiding the negative connotation of the word `` lead '' . Early research into `` engine knocking '' ( also called `` pinging '' or `` pinking '' ) was also led by A.H. Gibson and Harry Ricardo in England and Thomas Boyd in the United States . The discovery that lead additives modified this behavior led to the widespread adoption of their use in the 1920s , and therefore more powerful , higher - compression engines . In 1924 , Standard Oil of New Jersey ( ESSO / EXXON ) and General Motors created the Ethyl Gasoline Corporation to produce and market TEL . Deepwater , NJ across the river from Wilmington , was the site for production of some of DuPont 's most important chemicals , particularly tetraethyl lead ( TEL ) . After TEL production at the Bayway Refinery was shut down , Deepwater was the only plant in the Western hemisphere producing TEL up to 1948 , when it accounted for the bulk of the Dupont / Deepwater 's production .
