Looking through this article , I am exteremely surprised to find almost no criticism of Teddy , except for the ' Views on race ' section , which someone even tried to get deleted or washed down as per above . There has to be some criticism he received somewhere , which should be brough to light . I do agree he was a great man , but the article seems to be severly lacking in balance . 74.95. 169.158 ( talk ) 01 : 32 , 8 October 2008 ( UTC )
