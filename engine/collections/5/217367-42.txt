Calcification forms among vascular smooth muscle cells of the surrounding muscular layer , specifically in the muscle cells adjacent to atheromas and on the surface of atheroma plaques and tissue . In time , as cells die , this leads to extracellular calcium deposits between the muscular wall and outer portion of the atheromatous plaques . With the atheromatous plaque interfering with the regulation of the calcium deposition , it accumulates and crystallizes . A similar form of an intramural calcification , presenting the picture of an early phase of arteriosclerosis , appears to be induced by a number of drugs that have an antiproliferative mechanism of action ( Rainer Liedtke 2008 ) .
