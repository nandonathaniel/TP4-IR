Cup Series cars ( often called `` Cup cars '' ) adhere to a front engine rear - wheel - drive design . A roll cage serves as a space frame chassis and is covered by a 24 - gauge sheet metal body . They have a closed cockpit , fenders , a rear spoiler , and an aerodynamic splitter . Fielding a car for one season usually costs $ 10 -- 20 million . Each team may build its own cars and engines ( per NASCAR 's specifications ) or purchase cars and engines from other teams .
