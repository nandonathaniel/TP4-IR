Due to the importance of Montreal to New France , a double wall 6.4 metres tall and over three kilometres long was erected in 1737 ( after twenty years of construction ) to protect the city . Only some of the base of the wall remains today . This helped make Montreal the most militarily capable town in New France , and so when the seven years war started Montreal was declared the military headquarters for operations in the North American Theater . As the military headquarters , the number of military men in Montreal began to increase and the town itself was further expanded and stressed Montreal for supplies .
