From 1894 to the late 1920s , movies were silent films . Silent film actors emphasized body language and facial expression , so that the audience could better understand what an actor was feeling and portraying on screen . Much silent film acting is apt to strike modern - day audiences as simplistic or campy . The melodramatic acting style was in some cases a habit actors transferred from their former stage experience . Vaudeville theatre was an especially popular origin for many American silent film actors . The pervading presence of stage actors in film was the cause of this outburst from director Marshall Neilan in 1917 : `` The sooner the stage people who have come into pictures get out , the better for the pictures . '' In other cases , directors such as John Griffith Wray required their actors to deliver larger - than - life expressions for emphasis . As early as 1914 , American viewers had begun to make known their preference for greater naturalness on screen .
