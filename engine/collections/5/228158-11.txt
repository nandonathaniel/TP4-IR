Rogaland lies in a weak tectonic zone , allowing the river to dig into the surrounding sandstone mountain . During the several ice ages known to have occurred in Scandinavia , Norway was completely covered in glaciers . Between the ice ages , the meltwater formed and reformed the valley up to 22 times . After the last ice age , global warming caused a rise in sea level , flooding the fjords . The boulder was deposited during the last glacial period , at around 50,000 B.C. As the Norwegian Glacier melted , it was accompanied by a rebound in rock formations as the ice was removed . In Kjeragbolten 's case , the rebound was actually faster than the rising sea level , which wedged the rock into its current position .
