Moreover , Tagore was hailed as a patriot who wrote other songs too apart from `` Jana Gana Mana '' lionising the Indian independence movement . He renounced his knighthood in protest against the 1919 Jallianwala Bagh Massacre . The Knighthood ( i.e. the title of ' Sir ' ) was conferred on him by the same King George V after receiving the Nobel Prize in Literature for `` Gitanjali '' from the government of Sweden . Two of Tagore 's more politically charged compositions , `` Chitto Jetha Bhayshunyo '' ( `` Where the Mind is Without Fear '' , Gitanjali Poem # 35 ) and `` Ekla Chalo Re '' ( `` If They Answer Not to Thy Call , Walk Alone '' ) , gained mass appeal , with the latter favoured by Gandhi and Netaji .
