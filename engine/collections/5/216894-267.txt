The plantation owners had long feared such a revolt , and were well armed with some defensive preparations . But within weeks , the number of slaves who joined the revolt reached some 100,000 . Within the next two months , as the violence escalated , the slaves killed 4,000 whites and burned or destroyed 180 sugar plantations and hundreds of coffee and indigo plantations . At least 900 coffee plantations were destroyed , and the total damage inflicted over the next two weeks amounted to 2 million francs . In September 1791 , the surviving whites organized into militias and struck back , killing about 15,000 black people .
