On 18 June 1984 , at Madison Square Garden in New York City , a riotous crowd prompted the venue to ban Priest . `` Madison Square Garden banned us for life '' , recalled Glenn Tipton . `` The audience went berserk and ripped all the seats out . They cost more than a quarter of a million dollars to replace . Me and Ken ( KK Downing ) went back there to see a tennis match which John McEnroe was playing in . We went incognito , wearing hoodies so no one would recognize us , but the ushers came up to us and said , ' Thanks for the new seats , guys . ' ''
