Alternative identifications for the two secondary female figures involve those also found in the Primavera ; the nymph held by Zephyr may be Chloris , a flower nymph he married in some versions of her story , and the figure on land may be Flora . Flora is generally the Roman equivalent of the Greek Chloris ; in the Primavera Chloris is transformed into the figure of Flora next to her , following Ovid 's Fasti , but it is hard to see that such a transformation is envisaged here . However , the roses blown along with the two flying figures would be appropriate for Chloris .
