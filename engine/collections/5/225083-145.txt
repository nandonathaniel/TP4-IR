with determinant equal to one : αδ − βγ = 1 . This set forms a group , since the inverse of a matrix in Γ is again in Γ , as is the product of two matrices in Γ . The modular group acts on the collection of all integer spinors . Furthermore , the group is transitive on the collection of integer spinors with relatively prime entries . For if ( m n ) has relatively prime entries , then
