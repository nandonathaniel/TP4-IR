`` The Portuguese vengeance was awesome . The police helped civilian vigilantes organize nightly slaughters in the Luanda slums . The whites hauled Africans from their flimsy one - room huts , shot them and left their bodies in the streets . A Methodist missionary ... testified that he personally knew of the deaths of almost three hundred . '' -- John Marcum
