The magnitude of the components of a vector are to be considered dimensionally distinct . For example , rather than an undifferentiated length dimension L , we may have L represent dimension in the x-direction , and so forth . This requirement stems ultimately from the requirement that each component of a physically meaningful equation ( scalar , vector , or tensor ) must be dimensionally consistent . Mass as a measure of quantity is to be considered dimensionally distinct from mass as a measure of inertia .
