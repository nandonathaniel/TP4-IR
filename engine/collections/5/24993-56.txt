The affordable sports car market enjoyed a revival in the 1990s after going into virtual hibernation in the 1980s . Sparked by the popularity of the Japanese - built Mazda MX - 5 after its launch in 1989 , Rover began development on a new sports car in the early 1990s , finally launching the MG F two - seater roadster in 1995 , 15 years after the demise of the last volume MG sports cars . The 1996 Lotus Elise also enjoyed relatively strong sales in this market sector , as did the Vauxhall VX220 ( based on the Elise ) which was launched in 2000 . Ford , which had exited the sports car market by 1987 with the demise of the Capri to concentrate on faster versions of its best - selling hatchbacks and saloons , returned to this market sector in 1994 with the American - built Probe , and then enjoyed more success with its smaller Puma between 1997 and 2002 .
