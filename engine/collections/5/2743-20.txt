In Game 1 of the 1954 World Series at the Polo Grounds against the Cleveland Indians , Willie Mays made `` The Catch , '' a dramatic over-the - shoulder catch of a fly ball by Vic Wertz after sprinting with his back to the plate on a dead run to deepest center field . At the time the game was tied 2 -- 2 in the eighth inning , with men on first and second and nobody out . Mays caught the ball 450 ft ( 140 m ) from the plate , whirled and threw the ball to the infield , keeping the lead runner , Larry Doby , from scoring . Although Doby took third after the catch , he was stranded there and the Giants won on Dusty Rhodes ' tenth - inning pinch - hit walk - off home run with two aboard , 5 - 2 .
