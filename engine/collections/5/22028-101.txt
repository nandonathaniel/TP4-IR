It is not yet known exactly how much wave energy is available to heat the corona . Results published in 2004 using data from the TRACE spacecraft seem to indicate that there are waves in the solar atmosphere at frequencies as high as 100 mHz ( 10 second period ) . Measurements of the temperature of different ions in the solar wind with the UVCS instrument aboard SOHO give strong indirect evidence that there are waves at frequencies as high as 200 Hz , well into the range of human hearing . These waves are very difficult to detect under normal circumstances , but evidence collected during solar eclipses by teams from Williams College suggest the presences of such waves in the 1 -- 10 Hz range .
