Lacking an operating repository , the federal government initially paid utility companies somewhere between $300 and $500 million per year in compensation for failing to comply with the contract it signed to take the spent nuclear fuel by 1998 . For the ten years after 2015 it is estimated to cost taxpayers $24 billion in payments from the Judgment Fund . The Judgment Fund is not subject to budget rules and allows Congress to ignore the nuclear waste issue since payments therefrom do not have any impact on yearly spending for other programs .
