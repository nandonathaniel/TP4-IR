By 2014 , the wind industry in the USA was able to produce more power at lower cost by using taller wind turbines with longer blades , capturing the faster winds at higher elevations . This opened up new opportunities and in Indiana , Michigan , and Ohio , the price of power from wind turbines built 300 feet to 400 feet above the ground competed with conventional fossil fuels like coal . Prices had fallen to about 4 cents per kilowatt - hour in some cases and utilities had been increasing the amount of wind energy in their portfolio , saying it is their cheapest option . For power contracts made in the year 2014 , the average price of wind power fell to 2.5 Â¢ / kWh .
