A succession of distance indicators , which is the distance ladder , is needed for determining distances to other galaxies . The reason is that objects bright enough to be recognized and measured at such distances are so rare that few or none are present nearby , so there are too few examples close enough with reliable trigonometric parallax to calibrate the indicator . For example , Cepheid variables , one of the best indicators for nearby spiral galaxies , can not yet be satisfactorily calibrated by parallax alone , though the Gaia space mission is expected to solve that specific problem . The situation is further complicated by the fact that different stellar populations generally do not have all types of stars in them . Cepheids in particular are massive stars , with short lifetimes , so they will only be found in places where stars have very recently been formed . Consequently , because elliptical galaxies usually have long ceased to have large - scale star formation , they will not have Cepheids . Instead , distance indicators whose origins are in an older stellar population ( like novae and RR Lyrae variables ) must be used . However , RR Lyrae variables are less luminous than Cepheids , and novae are unpredictable and an intensive monitoring program -- and luck during that program -- is needed to gather enough novae in the target galaxy for a good distance estimate .
