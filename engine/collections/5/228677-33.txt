The conclusion that genetic influences are pervasive has also been observed in research designs that do not depend on the assumptions of the twin method . Adoption studies show that adoptees are routinely more similar to their biological relatives than their adoptive relatives for a wide variety of traits and disorders . In the Minnesota Study of Twins Reared Apart , monozygotic twins separated shortly after birth were reunited in adulthood . These adopted , reared - apart twins were as similar to one another as were twins reared together on a wide range of measures including general cognitive ability , personality , religious attitudes , and vocational interests , among others . Approaches using genome - wide genotyping have allowed researchers to measure genetic relatedness between individuals and estimate heritability based on millions of genetic variants . Methods exist to test whether the extent of genetic similarity ( aka , relatedness ) between nominally unrelated individuals ( individuals who are not close or even distant relatives ) is associated with phenotypic similarity . Such methods do not rely on the same assumptions as twin or adoption studies , and routinely find evidence for heritability of behavioural traits and disorders .
