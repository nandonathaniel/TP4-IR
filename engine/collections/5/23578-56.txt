Nine weeks have passed since the unresolved election , which will now be decided by a contingent election in the House . A frustrated Conway believes he was fairly elected , and begins to show signs of a potential breakdown . Despite Frank 's approval rating falling to 19 % , Claire says they are done winning the American people and must now win over Congress . Hammerschmidt meets with Lisa Williams to discuss information regarding Doug , but he is hesitant to believe her . Frank talks to convince Alex Romero , a Democratic congressman , to sway other House Democrats to vote for him . Aidan , who had previously gone missing , calls LeAnn to tell her that he will leak incriminating information on the Underwoods if she does n't get the authorities off his back . While LeAnn is able to flip a vote from Maine , Doug fails to win New Hampshire . On the day of the vote , Claire asks Donald to prevent a filibuster and keep Republicans off the floor . When he refuses , Claire begins insulting him and his late wife . Neither Conway nor Frank receive the 26 votes in the House needed to win , meaning that the Senate 's vice presidential selection between Claire and General Ted Brockhart will assume the duties of the Presidency until the House votes again . Claire , alone in the White House residence , walks toward the camera and briefly looks directly at the camera audience as the episode ends .
