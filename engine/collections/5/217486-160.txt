Employment status : a worker could be employed full - time , part - time , or on a casual basis . He or she could be employed for example temporarily for a specific project only , or on a permanent basis . Part - time wage labour could combine with part - time self - employment . The worker could be employed also as an apprentice . Civil ( legal ) status : the worker could for example be a free citizen , an indentured labourer , the subject of forced labour ( including some prison or army labour ) ; a worker could be assigned by the political authorities to a task , they could be a semi-slave or a serf bound to the land who is hired out part of the time . So the labour might be performed on a more or less voluntary basis , or on a more or less involuntary basis , in which there are many gradations . Method of payment ( remuneration or compensation ) . The work done could be paid `` in cash '' ( a money - wage ) or `` in kind '' ( through receiving goods and / or services ) , or in the form of `` piece rates '' where the wage is directly dependent on how much the worker produces . In some cases , the worker might be paid in the form of credit used to buy goods and services , or in the form of stock options or shares in an enterprise . Method of hiring : the worker might engage in a labour - contract on his or her own initiative , or he or she might hire out their labour as part of a group . But he or she may also hire out their labour via an intermediary ( such as an employment agency ) to a third party . In this case , he or she is paid by the intermediary , but works for a third party which pays the intermediary . In some cases , labour is subcontracted several times , with several intermediaries . Another possibility is that the worker is assigned or posted to a job by a political authority , or that an agency hires out a worker to an enterprise together with means of production .
