When considered as paired rows , each row forms an arch which is convex proximally and concave distally . On the palmar side , the carpus is concave and forms the carpal tunnel , which is covered by the flexor retinaculum . The proximal row ( comprising scaphoid , lunate , and triquetrum ) articulates with the surfaces of the radius and distal carpal row , and thus constantly adapts to these mobile surfaces . Within the proximal row , each carpal bone has slight independent mobility . For example , the scaphoid contributes to midcarpal stability by articulating distally with the trapezium and the trapezoid . In contrast , the distal row is more rigid as its transverse arch moves with the metacarpals .
