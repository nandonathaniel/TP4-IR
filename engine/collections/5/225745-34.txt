Typically , the processor samples the interrupt input at predefined times during each bus cycle such as state T2 for the Z80 microprocessor . If the interrupt is n't active when the processor samples it , the CPU does n't see it . One possible use for this type of interrupt is to minimize spurious signals from a noisy interrupt line : a spurious pulse will often be so short that it is not noticed .
