Sofia goes on an outing with her Buttercup scout friends : Ruby , Jade , and identical twins Peg and Meg . Roland worries for Sofia 's safety despite the troop leader / Ruby 's mother 's assurances and makes Baileywick go with her , including bringing along all of her princess supplies which are unnecessary for an outdoors trip . Baileywick 's worrying and presence often gets in the way of Sofia 's activities , which hinders her from earning one more badge to get a sunflower pin , a pin that shows a sign of recognition that you have filled up your entire vest with badges . Sofia talks to Baileywick , who agrees to let her do the next project by herself : flower - gathering . Although he gave his word , Baileywick overhears Ruby 's mother 's warning about touching poisonous plants , and tries to help Sofia . This backfires when he accidentally touches a poisonous Meddlesome Myrtle and is infected with rashes and swelling , much to the Buttercup scouts horror . The trail is too steep for Baileywick , with his swollen feet , to walk , so the troop builds a makeshift sled with wood , twine and some princess supplies he brought . This being Sofia 's idea , she leads the team and working together , they get everyone down the trail safely , which earns her her last badge and sunflower pin . Baileywick returns to the castle to be treated , but not before he tells Roland about how Sofia is fine being independent . The Buttercups visit him soon after and name him an honorary troop leader , complete with his own vest and a `` Being Prepared '' badge . Song : `` We 're Buttercups ! ''
