The Andean orogen has a series of bends or oroclines . The Bolivian Orocline is a seaward concave bending in the coast of South America and the Andes Mountains at about 18 ° S. At this point the orientation of the Andes turns from Northwest in Peru to South in Chile and Argentina . The Andean segment north and south of the orocline have been rotated 15 ° to 20 ° counter clockwise and clockwise respectively . The Bolivian Orocline area overlaps with the area of maximum width of the Altiplano Plateau and according to Isacks ( 1988 ) the orocline is related to crustal shortening . The specific point at 18 ° S where the coastline bends is known as the `` Arica Elbow '' . Further south lies the Maipo Orocline or Maipo Transition Zone located between 30 ° S and 38 ° S with a break in trend at 33 ° S. Near the southern tip of the Andes lies the Patagonian orocline .
