Canada is divided into ten provinces and three territories . The majority of Canada 's population is concentrated in the areas close to the Canada -- US border . Its four largest provinces by area ( Quebec , Ontario , British Columbia and Alberta ) are also ( with Quebec and Ontario switched in order ) its most populous ; together they account for 86 % of the country 's population . The territories ( the Northwest Territories , Nunavut and Yukon ) account for over a third of Canada 's area but are home to only 0.3 % of its population , which skews the national population density value .
