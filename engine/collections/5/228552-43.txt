Wood has a tattoo of the number nine written in the Sindarin language , which uses the Tengwar script , and in the English language ( rather than Quenya as is widely believed ) , below his waist on the right side . It refers to his character as one of the Fellowship of the Ring . By coincidence , he had a voice role in a film titled 9 . The other actors of `` The Fellowship '' got the same tattoo , with the exception of John Rhys - Davies , whose stunt double got the tattoo instead .
