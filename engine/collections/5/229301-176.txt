As provided by the secret treaty , the allies agreed in a `` Protocol of Subsidies '' that Bolivia had to bear the costs of the war . The agreement , which bound the tax income for many years , caused resentments and fears in Bolivia , where the deployment of Bolivian forces to Tacna was seen as a help to Peru and , moreover , when they knew that the Bolivian army would n't be sent to free the occupied region of Bolivia but to protect Peru . As Daza and his officers came to Tacna and Arica , they did n't see the expected Peruvian military strength and they understood that their position of power in Bolivia was threatened by a defeat of the allied armies . Bolivian historian Querejazu suggests that Daza used the Chilean offer of Tacna und Arica for Bolivia in order exert pressure on Peru to get a more favorable `` Protocolo de Subsidios '' , which is what he got .
