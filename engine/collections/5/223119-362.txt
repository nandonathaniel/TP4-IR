Belarus lost a quarter of its pre-war population , including practically all its intellectual elite . Following bloody encirclement battles , all of the present - day Belarus territory was occupied by the Germans by the end of August 1941 . The Nazis imposed a brutal regime , deporting some 380,000 young people for slave labour , and killing hundreds of thousands ( civilians ) more . More than 600 villages like Khatyn were burned with their entire population . More than 209 cities and towns ( out of 270 total ) and 9,000 villages were destroyed . Himmler pronounced a plan according to which ​ ⁄ of the Belarusian population was designated for `` eradication '' and ​ ⁄ of the racially ' cleaner ' population ( blue eyes , light hair ) would be allowed to serve Germans as slaves .
