While Swift 's proposal is obviously not a serious economic proposal , George Wittkowsky , author of `` Swift 's Modest Proposal : The Biography of an Early Georgian Pamphlet '' , argues that to understand the piece fully , it is important to understand the economics of Swift 's time . Wittowsky argues that not enough critics have taken the time to focus directly on the mercantilism and theories of labour in 18th century England . `` ( I ) f one regards the Modest Proposal simply as a criticism of condition , about all one can say is that conditions were bad and that Swift 's irony brilliantly underscored this fact '' .
