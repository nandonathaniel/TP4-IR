In raspberries , these types are called primocane fruiting , fall fruiting , or everbearing . ' Prime - Jim ' and ' Prime - Jan ' were released in 2004 by the University of Arkansas and are the first cultivars of primocane fruiting blackberry . They grow much like the other erect cultivars described above ; however , the canes that emerge in the spring will flower in mid-summer and fruit in late summer or fall . The fall crop has its highest quality when it ripens in cool mild climate such as in California or the Pacific Northwest .
