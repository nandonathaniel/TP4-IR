Despite the Japanese Pan-Asian rhetoric and claim to be liberating India , the Indian people did not revolt and the Indian soldiers of the 14th Army stayed loyal to their British officers , and the invasion of India ended in complete disaster . The Japanese were defeated by the Anglo - Indian 14th Army at the Battles of Imphal and Kohima . On 5 July 1944 , the Emperor accepted Tojo 's advice to end the invasion of India as 72,000 Japanese soldiers had been killed in battle . A similar number had starved to death or died of diseases as the logistics to support an invasion of India were lacking , once the monsoons turned the roads of Burma into impassable mud . Of the 150,000 Japanese soldiers who had participated in the March invasion of India , most were dead by July 1944 .
