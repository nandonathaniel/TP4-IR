Water bodies on dry land , the atmosphere , beaches , sea ice , the sea surface micro-layer , marine sediments , oceanic crusts and hydrothermal systems all contributing to the Hadean micro-environment , would have a drastic impact on the origin of life in the Archaean . The atmosphere has had the most pivotal role since the Miller and Urey experiments in 1953 . Their experiments demonstrated the production of biologically important organic compounds ( including amino acids ) induced by passing electric charge through a mixture of gases which were at the time considered to be the components of Earth 's early , reducing atmosphere ( H O , CH , H and NH ) .
