In 3rd and 3.5 editions , what a character can and can not do in a given round is more codified ; a character may perform one standard and one move action , two move actions or one full - round action in a round , along with any number of free actions , and a single swift or immediate action . Unlike other types of actions , immediate actions may also be taken during someone else 's turn , though that counts as using the immediate action slot for the character 's following turn .
