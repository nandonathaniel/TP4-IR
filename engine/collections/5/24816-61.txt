An alternative approach to the net asset value method is the excess earnings method . This method was first described in ARM34 , and later refined by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service 's Revenue Ruling 68 - 609 . The excess earnings method has the appraiser identify the value of tangible assets , estimate an appropriate return on those tangible assets , and subtract that return from the total return for the business , leaving the `` excess '' return , which is presumed to come from the intangible assets . An appropriate capitalization rate is applied to the excess return , resulting in the value of those intangible assets . That value is added to the value of the tangible assets and any non-operating assets , and the total is the value estimate for the business as a whole .
