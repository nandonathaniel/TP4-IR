Stephen Soldz , who runs the website `` Iraq Occupation and Resistance Report '' , wrote in a February 5 , 2006 , article : `` Of course , in conditions of active rebellion , the safer areas accessible to Western reporters are likely to be those under US / Coalition control , where deaths are , in turn , likely to be due to insurgent attacks . Areas of insurgent control , which are likely to be subject to US and Iraqi government attack , for example most of Anbar province , are simply off - limits to these reporters . Thus , the realities of reporting imply that reporters will be witness to a larger fraction of deaths due to insurgents and a lesser proportion of deaths due to US and Iraqi government forces . ''
