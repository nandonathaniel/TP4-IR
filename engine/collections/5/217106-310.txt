The Claymore M18A1 , an anti-personnel mine , was widely used during the war . Unlike a conventional land mine , the Claymore is command - detonated and directional , meaning it is fired by remote - control and shoots a pattern of 700 one - eighth - inch steel balls into the kill zone like a shotgun .
