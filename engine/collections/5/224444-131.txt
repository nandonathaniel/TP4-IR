Jake Tucker ( voiced by Seth MacFarlane ) -- Tom Tucker 's deformed son and Chris ' former classmate . Jake 's many appearances show him with an `` upside - down face '' ; a mouth near the top of his head and eyes near the bottom . In `` It Takes a Village Idiot , and I Married One '' , he gets a normal face , via toxic waste . Although typically depicted as a demanding and obnoxious brat , Jake craves his father 's attention , which he rarely gets . It is also revealed in `` Peter Griffin : Husband , Father ... Brother ? '' that he `` does n't have a bottom '' . Though Tom often neglects him , he often shows that he cares when Brian accused Jake of giving Chris alcohol . However , when Chris gets his own back on Jake by planting drugs in his locker an enraged Tom declares him a `` bad boy '' and loses faith in him . In `` Mother Tucker '' , Jake is noticeably neglected by Tom when Tom pays more attention to Peter . But Peter then realizes that Tom should pay more attention to Jake .
