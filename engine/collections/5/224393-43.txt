Buckley is situated in north east Wales approximately 6 miles from the border with England to the East . Buckley is in the lee of the Snowdonian mountain range to the west and is therefore in a rain shadow area . Average annual rainfall in Buckley is approximately 700 -- 800 mm ( 28 -- 31 in ) which is significantly lower than areas to the West of the Snowdonian mountain range . However , in comparison to areas in the East and South East of the United Kingdom , Buckley still receives a fair amount of rainfall . Since Buckley is located approximately 130 -- 150 m ( 430 -- 490 ft ) above sea level , snowfall is more frequent in winter months in comparison to the lower lying ground in neighbouring areas .
