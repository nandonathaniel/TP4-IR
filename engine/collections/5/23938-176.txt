In July 2016 it was reported that fraudulent activity levels in the UK increased in the 10 years to 2016 from £ 52 billion to £ 193bn . This figure would be a conservative estimate , since as the former commissioner of the City of London Police , Adrian Leppard , has said , only 1 in 12 such crimes are actually reported . Donald Toon , director of the NCA 's economic crime command , stated in July 2016 : `` The annual losses to the UK from fraud are estimated to be more than £ 190bn '' . Figures released in October 2015 from the Crime Survey of England and Wales found that there had been 5.1 million incidents of fraud in England and Wales in the previous year , affecting an estimated one in 12 adults and making it the most common form of crime .
