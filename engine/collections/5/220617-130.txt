In mid-September , the Republican ticket faced a major crisis . The media reported that Nixon had a political fund , maintained by his backers , which reimbursed him for political expenses . Such a fund was not illegal , but it exposed Nixon to allegations of possible conflict of interest . With pressure building for Eisenhower to demand Nixon 's resignation from the ticket , the senator went on television to deliver an address to the nation on September 23 , 1952 . The address , later termed the Checkers speech , was heard by about 60 million Americans -- including the largest television audience up to that point . Nixon emotionally defended himself , stating that the fund was not secret , nor had donors received special favors . He painted himself as a man of modest means ( his wife had no mink coat ; instead she wore a `` respectable Republican cloth coat '' ) and a patriot . The speech would be remembered for the gift which Nixon had received , but which he would not give back : `` a little cocker spaniel dog ... sent all the way from Texas . And our little girl -- Tricia , the 6 - year - old -- named it Checkers . '' The speech prompted a huge public outpouring of support for Nixon . Eisenhower decided to retain him on the ticket , which proved victorious in the November election .
