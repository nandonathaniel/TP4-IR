Ali believed that people and governors have rights over each other and God created these rights so as to equate with one another . The greatest of these rights that Allah has made obligatory is the right of the ruler over the ruled and the right of the ruled over the ruler . If the ruled fulfill the rights of the ruler and the ruler fulfills their rights , then right attains the position of honor among them , the ways of religion become established , signs of justice become fixed and the sunnah gains currency . He wrote directions for his officials which clearly show what form of regime he wanted to introduce . It was not to be a regime whose officers had an upper hand and were fattened on public money . It was to be a regime where the governed and the tax - payers were at premium . It was their convenience for which the State was to function . It was a welfare - state working solely for the welfare of the people living under its rule , a regime where the rich can not get richer while the poor are made poorer ; a regime where canons of religion hold the balance between the governed and the ruler . He asked people not to speak with him as they spoke with cruel governors and be honest with him .
