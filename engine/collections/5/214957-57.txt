The script , written by Jeremy Joe Kronsberg , had been turned down by many other big production companies in Hollywood . Most of Eastwood 's production team and his agents thought it was ill - advised . Bob Hoyt , whom Eastwood had contacts with ( through his Malpaso secretary Judy Hoyt and Eastwood 's long - term friend Fritz Manes ) , thought it showed promise and eventually convinced Warner Brothers to buy it . An orangutan named Manis was brought in to play Clyde ; also cast were Geoffrey Lewis as the dimwitted Orville , Beverly D'Angelo as his girlfriend , and Sondra Locke as Lynn Halsey - Taylor , the country and western barroom singer . Eastwood spoke about using the orangutan for the main role , `` Clyde was one of the most natural actors I ever worked with ! But you had to get him on the first take because his boredom level was very limited . ''
