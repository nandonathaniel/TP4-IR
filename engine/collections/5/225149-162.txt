Gompers and nearly all labor unions were strong supporters of the war effort . They used their leverage to gain recognition and higher wages . They minimized strikes as wages soared and full employment was reached . To keep factories running smoothly , Wilson established the National War Labor Board in 1918 , which forced management to negotiate with existing unions . The AFL unions and the railway brotherhoods strongly encouraged their young men to enlist in the military . They fiercely opposed efforts to reduce recruiting and slow war production by the anti-war IWW and left - wing Socialists . President Wilson appointed Gompers to the powerful Council of National Defense , where he set up the War Committee on Labor . The AFL membership soared to 2.4 million in 1917 . Anti-war socialists controlled the IWW , which fought against the war effort and was in turn shut down by legal action by the federal government .
