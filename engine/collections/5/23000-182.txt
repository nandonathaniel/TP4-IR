The 1948 Arab -- Israeli War led to massive displacement of Arab and Jewish populations . According to Benny Morris , due to mob and militia violence on both sides , 1,500 of the 3,500 ( mostly ultra-Orthodox ) Jews in the Old City evacuated to west Jerusalem as a unit . See also Jewish Quarter . The comparatively populous Arab village of Lifta ( today within the bounds of Jerusalem ) was captured by Israeli troops in 1948 , and its residents were loaded on trucks and taken to East Jerusalem . The villages of Deir Yassin , Ein Karem and Malcha , as well as neighborhoods to the west of Jerusalem 's Old City such as Talbiya , Katamon , Baka , Mamilla and Abu Tor , also came under Israeli control , and their residents were forcibly displaced ; in some cases , as documented by Israeli historian Benny Morris and Palestinian historian Walid Khalidi , among others , expulsions and massacres occurred .
