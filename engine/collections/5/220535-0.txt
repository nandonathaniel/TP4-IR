The Australian head of state dispute refers to ongoing debate as to who is considered to be the head of state of Australia -- the Monarch or the Governor - General . Head of state is a description used in official sources for the monarch . The Australian constitution does not mention the term head of state . In discussion it has been used for describing the person who holds the highest rank among the officers of government . A number of writers , most notably David Smith , have argued that the term is better used to describe the governor - general . Some others and some publications in Australia have also referred to the governor - general as the head of state .
