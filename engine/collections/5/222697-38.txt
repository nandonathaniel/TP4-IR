In one story , Jughead claimed his great - grandmother was a Native American `` from the Pawtuxet tribe , '' despite the fact that the Patuxet were killed off by 1622 . In another story from the same era , he claimed his great - great - grandfather was `` an eskimo , '' who was `` the only cop north of Nome ... ' Ol ' Bluenose Jones ' they called him ! '' It is likely that neither of these claims are meant to be taken seriously . In both stories he also used his claims to make fun of Veronica , which suggests more that his comments were meant as jokes , since Jughead has a history of making up fibs to tease Veronica and other opponents .
