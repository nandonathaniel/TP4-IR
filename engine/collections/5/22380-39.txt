GIS offers a superior method for landslide analysis because it allows one to capture , store , manipulate , analyze , and display large amounts of data quickly and effectively . Because so many variables are involved , it is important to be able to overlay the many layers of data to develop a full and accurate portrayal of what is taking place on the Earth 's surface . Researchers need to know which variables are the most important factors that trigger landslides in any given location . Using GIS , extremely detailed maps can be generated to show past events and likely future events which have the potential to save lives , property , and money .
