Recent studies have shown a tight linkage between living organisms and chemical elements on this planet . This led to the redefinition of minerals as `` an element or compound , amorphous or crystalline , formed through ' biogeochemical ' processes . The addition of ' bio ' reflects a greater appreciation , although an incomplete understanding , of the processes of mineral formation by living forms . '' Biologists and geologists have only recently started to appreciate the magnitude of mineral biogeoengineering . Bacteria have contributed to the formation of minerals for billions of years and critically define the biogeochemical mineral cycles on this planet . Microorganisms can precipitate metals from solution contributing to the formation of ore deposits in addition to their ability to catalyze mineral dissolution , to respire , precipitate , and form minerals .
