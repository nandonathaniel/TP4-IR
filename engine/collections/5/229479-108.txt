Centered on Post Oak Boulevard and Westheimer Road , the Uptown District boomed during the 1970s and early 1980s when a collection of midrise office buildings , hotels , and retail developments appeared along Interstate 610 West . Uptown became one of the most prominent instances of an edge city . The tallest building in Uptown is the 64 - floor , 901 - foot ( 275 m ) - tall , Philip Johnson and John Burgee designed landmark Williams Tower ( known as the Transco Tower until 1999 ) . At the time of construction , it was believed to be the world 's tallest skyscraper outside a central business district . The new 20 - story Skanska building and BBVA Compass Plaza are the newest office buildings built in Uptown after 30 years . The Uptown District is also home to buildings designed by noted architects I.M. Pei , CÃ©sar Pelli , and Philip Johnson . In the late 1990s and early 2000s , a mini-boom of midrise and highrise residential tower construction occurred , with several over 30 stories tall . Since 2000 more than 30 high - rise buildings have gone up in Houston ; all told , 72 high - rises tower over the city , which adds up to about 8,300 units . In 2002 , Uptown had more than 23 million square feet ( 2,100,000 m2 ) of office space with 16 million square feet ( 1,500,000 m2 ) of class A office space .
