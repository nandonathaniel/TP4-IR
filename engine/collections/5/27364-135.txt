The French and Spanish established colonies in Florida , Louisiana , and Texas . The Spanish colonized Florida in the 16th century , with their communities reaching a peak in the late 17th century . In the British and French colonies , most immigrants arrived after 1700 . They cleared land , built houses and outbuildings , and worked on the large plantations that dominated export agriculture . Many were involved in the labor - intensive cultivation of tobacco , the first cash crop of Virginia . With a decrease in the number of British willing to go to the colonies in the eighteenth century , planters began importing more enslaved Africans , who became the predominant labor force on the plantations . Tobacco exhausted the soil quickly , requiring new fields to be cleared on a regular basis . Old fields were used as pasture and for crops such as corn and wheat , or allowed to grow into woodlots .
