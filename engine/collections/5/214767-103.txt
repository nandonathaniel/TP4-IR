The halftime show of Super Bowl XXXVIII attracted controversy , following an incident in which Justin Timberlake removed a piece of Janet Jackson 's top , briefly exposing one of her breasts before the broadcast quickly cut away from the shot . The incident led to fines being issued by the FCC ( and a larger crackdown over `` indecent '' content broadcast on television ) , and MTV ( then a sister to the game 's broadcaster that year , CBS , under Viacom ) being banned by the NFL from producing the Super Bowl halftime show in the future . In an effort to prevent a repeat of the incident , the NFL held a moratorium on Super Bowl halftime shows featuring pop performers , and instead invited a single , headlining veteran act , such as Paul McCartney , The Who , Prince , and Bruce Springsteen . This practice ended at Super Bowl XLV , which returned to using current pop acts such as The Black Eyed Peas and Katy Perry .
