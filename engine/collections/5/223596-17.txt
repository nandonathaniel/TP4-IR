This generalization of the concept of slope allows very complex constructions to be planned and built that go well beyond static structures that are either horizontals or verticals , but can change in time , move in curves , and change depending on the rate of change of other factors . Thereby , the simple idea of slope becomes one of the main basis of the modern world in terms of both technology and the built environment .
