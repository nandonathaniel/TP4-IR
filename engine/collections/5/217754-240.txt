Being located in the desert , Phoenix relies on a water supply delivered to the city via a system of canals which divert water from the region 's rivers and lakes , with the largest portion of the city 's water coming from the Colorado River through the Central Arizona Project 's canal . The city 's electrical needs are served primarily by Arizona Public Service , although some customers receive their electricity from the Salt River Project ( SRP ) . The main sources of electrical generation are nuclear , and coal power plants . Arizona is home to the Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station , the largest nuclear - generating facility in the United States . SRP is also the largest water provider in Phoenix .
