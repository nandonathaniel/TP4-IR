Water conservation programs involved in social solutions are typically initiated at the local level , by either municipal water utilities or regional governments . Common strategies include public outreach campaigns , tiered water rates ( charging progressively higher prices as water use increases ) , or restrictions on outdoor water use such as lawn watering and car washing . Cities in dry climates often require or encourage the installation of xeriscaping or natural landscaping in new homes to reduce outdoor water usage . Most urban outdoor water use in California is residential , illustrating a reason for outreach to households as well as businesses .
