21st President , 1881 -- 85 : His succession to the Presidency after the death of Garfield was the start of a quarter - century in which the White House was occupied by men of Ulster - Scots origins . His family left Dreen , near Cullybackey , County Antrim , in 1815 . There is now an interpretive centre , alongside the Arthur Ancestral Home , devoted to his life and times .
