The contestants must first play a preliminary round , called `` Fastest Finger First '' ( or , in the U.S. version , simply `` Fastest Finger '' ) , where they are all given a question and four answers from the host and are asked to put those four answers into a particular order ; in the first series of the British version and in pre-2003 episodes of the Australian version , the round instead required the contestants to answer one multiple - choice question correctly as quickly as possible . The contestant who does so correctly and in the fastest time goes on to play the main game for the maximum possible prize ( often a million units of the local currency ) . In the event that two or more contestants are tied for the fastest time , those contestants play another question to break the tie . If no one gets the question right , that question is discarded and another question is played in the same manner . If any contestants are visually impaired , the host reads the question and four choices all at once , then repeats the choices after the music begins .
