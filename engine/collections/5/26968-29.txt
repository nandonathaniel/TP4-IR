Halloween Town is a fantasy world filled with monsters , ghosts , ghouls , goblins , zombies , demons , mummies , vampires , werewolves , and witches Jack Skellington , the `` Pumpkin King '' and leader of the town , leads them in organizing the annual Halloween celebrations . However , privately Jack has grown weary of the same routine year after year , and wants something new . Wandering in the woods the morning after Halloween , he stumbles across seven trees containing doors leading to towns representing various holidays , and opens a portal to Christmas Town . Awed by the unfamiliar holiday , Jack returns to Halloween Town to show the residents his findings , but they fail to grasp the idea of Christmas and compare everything to their ideas of Halloween , although they do relate to one Christmas Town character ; a red lobster - like king who flies at night named `` Sandy Claws '' . Jack sequesters himself in his tower to study Christmas and find a way to rationally explain it , but can not . He ultimately decides that it 's unfair for Christmas Town alone to enjoy the holiday and announces that he and the citizens of Halloween Town will take over Christmas this year .
