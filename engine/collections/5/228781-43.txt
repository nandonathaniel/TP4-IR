In February 1970 , Ames awarded a combined $380 million contract to TRW for building both of the Pioneer 10 and 11 vehicles , bypassing the usual bidding process to save time . B.J. O'Brien and Herb Lassen led the TRW team that assembled the spacecraft . Design and construction of the spacecraft required an estimated 25 million man - hours . An engineer from TRW said `` This spacecraft is guaranteed for two years of interplanetary flight . If any component fails within that warranty period , just return the spacecraft to our shop and we will repair it free of charge . ''
