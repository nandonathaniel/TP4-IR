The commercial success of Frozen in Japan was considered to be a `` phenomenon '' which received widespread media coverage . Released in that market as Anna and the Snow Queen , the film increased its gross each week in its three first weeks of release , and only started to drop in the fourth ; while other films usually peak in the opening week and decline in the latter ones . Frozen has received over 7 million admissions in Japan as of April 16 , and nearly 18.7 million admissions as of June 23 . Many cinemagoers were reported to have watched both the original and the Japanese - dubbed version . Japan Today also reported that the local dubbed version was `` particularly popular '' in the country . Gavin J. Blair of The Hollywood Reporter commented on the film 's earnings in Japan : `` Even after its $9.6 million ( Â¥ 986.4 million ) three - day opening , a record bow for a Disney animation in Japan , few would have predicted the kind of numbers Frozen has now racked up . '' Disney 's head of distribution Dave Hollis said in an interview that `` It 's become very clear that the themes and emotions of Frozen transcend geography , but what 's going on in Japan is extraordinary .
