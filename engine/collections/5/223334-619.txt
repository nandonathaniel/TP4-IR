In April 2001 , a PRC J - 8 fighter jet collided with a US EP - 3 reconnaissance aircraft flying south of the PRC in what became known as the Hainan Island incident . The EP - 3 was able to make an emergency landing on PRC 's Hainan Island despite extensive damage ; the PRC aircraft crashed with the loss of its pilot , Wang Wei . The crew were detained by the PLA after destroying all classified documents pertaining to the aircraft 's operation . It was widely believed that the EP - 3 recon aircraft was conducting a spying mission on the PLA before the collision , which however took place over international waters . Following extensive negotiations resulting in the `` letter of the two sorries , '' the crew of the EP - 3 was released from imprisonment and allowed to leave the PRC eleven days later . The US aircraft was returned by Beijing three months later in pieces , after which the relationship between the US and the PRC gradually improved once more .
