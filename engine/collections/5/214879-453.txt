The case system was drastically reduced from the vigorous six - case system of Latin . Although four cases can be constructed for Proto - Romance nouns ( nominative , accusative , combined genitive / dative , and vocative ) , the vocative is marginal and present only in Romanian ( where it may be an outright innovation ) , and of the remaining cases , no more than two are present in any one language . Romanian is the only modern Romance language with case marking on nouns , with a two - way opposition between nominative / accusative and genitive / dative . Some of the older Gallo - Romance languages ( in particular , Old French , Old Occitan , Old Sursilvan and Old Friulian , and in traces Old Catalan and Old Venetian ) had an opposition between nominative and general oblique , and in Ibero - Romance languages , such as Spanish and Portuguese , as well as in Italian ( see under Case ) , a couple of examples are found which preserve the old nominative . As in English , case is preserved better on pronouns .
