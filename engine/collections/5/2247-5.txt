Religious leaders in England felt they had a duty as missionaries to bring Christianity ( or more specifically , the religious practices and beliefs of the Church of England in contrast to the Latin incursion of Central and South America ) , to the Native Americans . There was an assumption that their own `` mistaken '' spiritual beliefs were largely the result of a lack of education and literacy , since the Powhatan did not have need for a written language . Therefore , teaching them these skills would logically result in what the English saw as `` enlightenment '' in their religious practices , and bring them into the fold of the church , which was part of the government , and hence , a form of control . One of the earliest of these missionaries was Reverend Alexander Whitaker , who served from 1611 until his death in 1616 .
