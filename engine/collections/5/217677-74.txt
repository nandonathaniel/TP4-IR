In 1928 , the Republic was nominally unified under the Kuomintang ( KMT ) -- Chinese Nationalist Party -- after the Northern Expedition , and was in the early stages of industrialization and modernization when it was caught in the conflicts among the Kuomintang government , the Communist Party of China , ( founded 1921 ) , which was converted into a nationalist party ; local warlords , and the Empire of Japan . Most nation - building efforts were stopped during the full - scale Second Sino - Japanese War / War of Resistance against Japan from 1937 to 1945 , and later the widening gap between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party made a coalition government impossible , causing the resumption of the Chinese Civil War , in 1946 , shortly after the Japanese surrender to the Americans and the Western Allies in September 1945 .
