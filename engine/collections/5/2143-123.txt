For a short period from March to May 2004 , large clouds appeared in the Uranian atmosphere , giving it a Neptune - like appearance . Observations included record - breaking wind speeds of 820 km / h ( 510 mph ) and a persistent thunderstorm referred to as `` Fourth of July fireworks '' . On 23 August 2006 , researchers at the Space Science Institute ( Boulder , Colorado ) and the University of Wisconsin observed a dark spot on Uranus 's surface , giving scientists more insight into Uranus 's atmospheric activity . Why this sudden upsurge in activity occurred is not fully known , but it appears that Uranus 's extreme axial tilt results in extreme seasonal variations in its weather . Determining the nature of this seasonal variation is difficult because good data on Uranus 's atmosphere have existed for less than 84 years , or one full Uranian year . Photometry over the course of half a Uranian year ( beginning in the 1950s ) has shown regular variation in the brightness in two spectral bands , with maxima occurring at the solstices and minima occurring at the equinoxes . A similar periodic variation , with maxima at the solstices , has been noted in microwave measurements of the deep troposphere begun in the 1960s . Stratospheric temperature measurements beginning in the 1970s also showed maximum values near the 1986 solstice . The majority of this variability is thought to occur owing to changes in the viewing geometry .
