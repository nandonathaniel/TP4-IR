The name `` St. Bernard '' originates from the passes of Great and Little St Bernard . The two traveler 's hospices and passes are located only few miles away in the Western Alps between Switzerland Italy and France , near the Mont - Blanc . The passes , the lodges , and the dogs are named for Bernard of Menthon , the 11th century monk who established the stations .
