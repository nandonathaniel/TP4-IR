In 2005 , Carell signed a deal with NBC to star in The Office , a remake of the successful British TV series . In the series , a mockumentary about life at a mid-sized paper supply company , Carell played the role of Michael Scott , the idiosyncratic regional manager of Dunder Mifflin Inc , in Scranton , Pennsylvania . Although the first season of the adaptation suffered mediocre ratings , NBC renewed it for another season due to the anticipated success of Carell 's film The 40 - Year - Old Virgin , and the series subsequently became a ratings success . Carell won a Golden Globe Award and Television Critics Association Award during 2006 for his role in The Office . He received six Primetime Emmy Award nominations for his work in the series ( 2006 -- 2011 ) . Carell earned approximately US $ 175,000 per episode of the third season of The Office , twice his salary for the previous two seasons . In an Entertainment Weekly interview , he commented on his salary , saying , `` You do n't want people to think you 're a pampered jerk . Salaries can be ridiculous . On the other hand , a lot of people are making a lot of money off of these shows . ''
