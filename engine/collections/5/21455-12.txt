Tsugumi Ohba , the writer of the series , created L as a young adult , since he believed the story would not hold much interest if L were significantly older than his opponent , Light . For L 's name , he wanted to use a single letter with a lot of significance ; he considered `` I '' and `` J '' , but eventually he chose `` L '' after careful consideration . Ohba left most of L 's character design to Takeshi Obata , artist of the series . Obata asked Ohba if L could be `` unattractive '' . Afterwards Ohba included ideas in his thumbnails , including L 's manner of sitting , `` he 's English '' , and `` he 's listless '' . Ohba added details regarding L 's mannerisms and his interests in sweets . Ohba credits Obata for the character designs . Obata commented that L 's thumbnails by Ohba had no bags under his eyes , and that he had a `` plain face with no expression '' which was very useful . Obata drew L as an `` attractive young man '' until chapter 11 , when the character appeared in person . After chapter 11 , Obata and Ohba agreed to contrast his appearance with Light 's .
