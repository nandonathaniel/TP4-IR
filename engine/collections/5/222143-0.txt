Transformational grammar ( TG ) or transformational - generative grammar ( TGG ) is , in the study of linguistics , part of the theory of generative grammar , especially of naturally evolved languages , that considers grammar to be a system of rules that generate exactly those combinations of words which form grammatical sentences in a given language . TG involves the use of defined operations called transformations to produce new sentences from existing ones . The concept was originated by Noam Chomsky , and much current research in transformational grammar has been inspired by Chomsky 's Minimalist Program .
