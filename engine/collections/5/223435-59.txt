In 2010 , Whitestone Motion Pictures produced a 23 - minute live - action short film , Heartless : The Story of the Tin Man . The film is based on the book The Tin Woodman of Oz , where Woot the Wanderer visits the Tin Man and asks how he came to be made of tin . In the film , the Tin Man appears to be more steam - or coal - powered . His chest cavity is covered by a door which reads `` Pedudoe Tin Co . '' but this is a reference to the workings of the film company , and not a reference to any Oz book or material . The movie was made available for free viewing online and free downloading of its soundtrack .
