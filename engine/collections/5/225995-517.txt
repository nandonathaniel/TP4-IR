In countries where the majority of the population is of immigrant descent , such as the United States , opposition to immigration sometimes takes the form of nativism . Hispanophobia has existed in various degrees throughout U.S. history , based largely on ethnicity , race , culture , Anti-Catholicism , economic and social conditions in Latin America , and use of the Spanish language . In 2006 , Time Magazine reported that the number of hate groups in the United States increased by 33 percent since 2000 , primarily due to anti-illegal immigrant and anti-Mexican sentiment . According to Federal Bureau of Investigation statistics , the number of anti-Latino hate crimes increased by 35 percent since 2003 ( albeit from a low level ) . In California , the state with the largest Latino population , the number of hate crimes against Latinos almost doubled .
