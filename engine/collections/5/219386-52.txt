By 1935 , Didrikson began to play golf , a latecomer to the sport in which she became best known . Shortly thereafter , she was denied amateur status , and so , in January 1938 , she competed in the Los Angeles Open , a men 's PGA ( Professional Golfers ' Association ) tournament . No other woman competed against men in this tournament until Annika SÃ¶renstam , Suzy Whaley and Michelle Wie almost six decades later . She shot 81 and 84 , and missed the cut . In the tournament , she was teamed with George Zaharias . They were married eleven months later , and settled in Tampa , Florida , on the premises of a golf course that they purchased in 1951 .
