The observable phenomenon here depends only on the relative motion of the conductor and the magnet , whereas the customary view draws a sharp distinction between the two cases in which either the one or the other of these bodies is in motion . For if the magnet is in motion and the conductor at rest , there arises in the neighbourhood of the magnet an electric field with a certain definite energy , producing a current at the places where parts of the conductor are situated .
