A set is three or four of a kind , ten or greater ( 7s , 8s , and 9s do n't count , and aces are highest ) . Sets of three are called trios or `` brelans and are worth 3 points , and sets of four , quatorzes ( '' cat - orz `` ) , are worth 14 points . The declarations take place in the same manner as `` point '' and `` sequence '' , with elder stating his best set ( for example , `` Three kings '' ) , to which younger replies `` Good '' or `` Not good '' . The player with the best set may declare any additional sets that he has if desired .
