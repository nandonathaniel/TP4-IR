Capacitor discharge ignition ( CDI ) or thyristor ignition is a type of automotive electronic ignition system which is widely used in outboard motors , motorcycles , lawn mowers , chainsaws , small engines , turbine - powered aircraft , and some cars . It was originally developed to overcome the long charging times associated with high inductance coils used in inductive discharge ignition ( IDI ) systems , making the ignition system more suitable for high engine speeds ( for small engines , racing engines and rotary engines ) . The capacitive - discharge ignition uses capacitor discharge current to the coil to fire the spark plugs .
