Sumer is Icumen in , Loudly sing , cuckoo ! Grows the seed and blows the mead , And springs the wood anew ; Sing , cuckoo ! Ewe bleats harshly after lamb , Cows after calves make moo ; Bullock stamps and deer champs , Now shrilly sing , cuckoo ! Cuckoo , cuckoo Wild bird are you ; Be never still , cuckoo !
