The Arthashastra , in Topic 6 , describes checks and continuous measurement , in secret , of the integrity and lack of integrity of all ministers and high officials in the kingdom . Those officials who lack integrity must be arrested . Those who are unrighteous , should not work in civil and criminal courts . Those who lack integrity in financial matters or fall for the lure of money must not be in revenue collection or treasury , states the text , and those who lack integrity in sexual relationships must not be appointed to Vihara services ( pleasure grounds ) . The highest level ministers must have been tested and have successfully demonstrated integrity in all situations and all types of allurements .
