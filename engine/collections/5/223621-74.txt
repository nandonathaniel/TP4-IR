The Treaty of Alcáçovas ( 4 September 1479 ) , while assuring the Castilian throne to the Catholic Monarchs , reflected the Castilian naval and colonial defeat : `` War with Castile broke out waged savagely in the Gulf ( of Guinea ) until the Castilian fleet of thirty - five sail was defeated there in 1478 . As a result of this naval victory , at the Treaty of Alcáçovas in 1479 Castile , while retaining her rights in the Canaries , recognized the Portuguese monopoly of fishing and navigation along the whole west African coast and Portugal 's rights over the Madeira , Azores and Cape Verde islands ( plus the right to conquer the Kingdom of Fez ) . '' The treaty delimited the spheres of influence of the two countries , establishing the principle of the Mare clausum . It was confirmed in 1481 by the Pope Sixtus IV , in the papal bull Æterni regis ( dated on 21 June 1481 ) .
