In 1716 , the Spanish government established several Roman Catholic missions in East Texas . The isolation of the missions -- the nearest Spanish settlement , San Juan Bautista , Coahuila was over 400 miles ( 644 km ) away -- made it difficult to keep them adequately provisioned . To assist the missionaries , the new governor of Spanish Texas , Martín de Alarcón , wished to establish a way station between the settlements along the Rio Grande and the new missions in East Texas . In April 1718 , Alarcón led an expedition to found a new community in Texas . On May 1 , the group erected a temporary mud , brush , and straw structure near the headwaters of the San Antonio River . This building would serve as a new mission , San Antonio de Valero , named after Saint Anthony of Padua and the viceroy of New Spain , Baltasar de Zúñiga y Guzmán Sotomayor y Sarmiento , Marquess of Valero . The mission , headed by Father Antonio de San Buenaventura y Olivares , was located near a community of Coahuiltecans and was initially populated by three to five Indian converts from Mission San Francisco Solano near San Juan Bautista . One mile ( two km ) north of the mission , Alarcón built a presidio ( fort ) , the Presidio San Antonio de Bexar . Close by , he founded the first civilian community in Texas , San Antonio de Bexar ( now San Antonio , Texas ) .
