Identity theft is the deliberate use of someone else 's identity , usually as a method to gain a financial advantage or obtain credit and other benefits in the other person 's name , and perhaps to the other person 's disadvantage or loss . The person whose identity has been assumed may suffer adverse consequences , especially if they are held responsible for the perpetrator 's actions . Identity theft occurs when someone uses another 's personally identifying information , like their name , identifying number , or credit card number , without their permission , to commit fraud or other crimes . The term identity theft was coined in 1964 . Since that time , the definition of identity theft has been statutorily prescribed throughout both the U.K. and the United States as the theft of personally identifying information , generally including a person 's name , date of birth , social security number , driver 's license number , bank account or credit card numbers , PIN numbers , electronic signatures , fingerprints , passwords , or any other information that can be used to access a person 's financial resources .
