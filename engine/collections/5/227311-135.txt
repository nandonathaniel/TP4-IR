In Britain , the first official news came from German wireless broadcasts . Ships began to arrive in port , their crews sending messages to friends and relatives both of their survival and the loss of some 6,000 others . Authorities considered suppressing the news , but it had already spread widely . Some crews coming ashore found rumours had already reported them dead to relatives , while others were jeered for the defeat they had suffered . At 19 : 00 on 2 June , the Admiralty released a statement based on information from Jellicoe containing the bare news of losses on each side . The following day British newspapers reported a German victory . The Daily Mirror described the German Director of the Naval Department telling the Reichstag : `` The result of the fighting is a significant success for our forces against a much stronger adversary '' . The British population was shocked that the long anticipated battle had been a victory for Germany . On 3 June , the Admiralty issued a further statement expanding on German losses , and another the following day with exaggerated claims . However , on 7 June the German admission of the losses of LÃ¼tzow and Rostock started to redress the sense of the battle as a loss . International perception of the battle began to change towards a qualified British victory , the German attempt to change the balance of power in the North Sea having been repulsed . In July , bad news from the Somme campaign swept concern over Jutland from the British consciousness .
