The invariant mass ( or rest mass ) is an invariant for all frames of reference ( hence the name ) , not just in inertial frames in flat spacetime , but also accelerated frames traveling through curved spacetime ( see below ) . However the total energy of the particle E and its relativistic momentum p are frame - dependent ; relative motion between two frames causes the observers in those frames to measure different values of the particle 's energy and momentum ; one frame measures E and p , while the other frame measures E ′ and p ′ , where E ′ ≠ E and p ′ ≠ p , unless there is no relative motion between observers , in which case each observer measures the same energy and momenta . Although we still have , in flat spacetime ;
