The Lego Group 's motto is det bedste er ikke for godt which means roughly `` only the best is the best '' ( more literally `` the best is never too good '' ) . This motto , which is still used today , was created by Ole Kirk to encourage his employees never to skimp on quality , a value he believed in strongly . By 1951 plastic toys accounted for half of the Lego Company 's output , even though the Danish trade magazine Leget√∏js - Tidende ( `` Toy - Times '' ) , visiting the Lego factory in Billund in the early 1950s , felt that plastic would never be able to replace traditional wooden toys . Although a common sentiment , Lego toys seem to have become a significant exception to the dislike of plastic in children 's toys , due in part to the high standards set by Ole Kirk .
