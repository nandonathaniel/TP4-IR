During the Renaissance , the standing remains of the city 's massive masonry aqueducts inspired architects , engineers and their patrons ; Pope Nicholas V renovated the main channels of the Roman Aqua Virgo in 1453 . Many aqueducts in Rome 's former empire were kept in good repair . The 15th - century rebuilding of aqueduct at Segovia in Spain shows advances on the Pont du Gard by using fewer arches of greater height , and so greater economy in its use of the raw materials . The skill in building aqueducts was not lost , especially of the smaller , more modest channels used to supply water wheels . Most such mills in Britain were developed in the medieval period for bread production , and used similar methods as that developed by the Romans with leats tapping local rivers and streams .
