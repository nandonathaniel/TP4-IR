In 2016 , the Brewers replaced their road navy and home gold alternates with a new navy alternate jersey . The uniform is similar to the previous road navy alternate but with yellow replacing gold as the trim color , and will be paired with a navy cap featuring the `` ball - and - glove '' logo . The navy road alternate has been worn far more often in 2016 than the official gray road jersey , although it has also been used on home games .
