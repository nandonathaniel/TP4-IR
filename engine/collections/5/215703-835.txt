Rowling released an alternative title for Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows for use by translators finding difficulty translating its meaning . The alternative title ( in English ) is Harry Potter and the Relics of Death . In Italy the title has been translated as Harry Potter ei doni della morte replacing `` hallows '' with `` presents '' because the word `` relic '' is often used in reference to the remains or personal effects of a saint . This variation was proposed and then approved by J.K. Rowling .
