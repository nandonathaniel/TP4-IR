A systematic review of few human trials examined the potential of low GI diet to improve pregnancy outcomes . Potential benefits were still seen despite no ground breaking findings in maternal glycemia or pregnancy outcomes . In this regard , more women under low GI diet achieved the target treatment goal for the postprandial glycemic level and reduced their need for insulin treatment . A low GI diet can also provide greater benefits to overweight and obese women . Intervention at an early stage of pregnancy has shown a tendency to lower birth weight and birth centile in infants born to women with GDM .
