Figure 1 illustrates velocity and acceleration vectors for uniform motion at four different points in the orbit . Because the velocity v is tangent to the circular path , no two velocities point in the same direction . Although the object has a constant speed , its direction is always changing . This change in velocity is caused by an acceleration a , whose magnitude is ( like that of the velocity ) held constant , but whose direction also is always changing . The acceleration points radially inwards ( centripetally ) and is perpendicular to the velocity . This acceleration is known as centripetal acceleration .
