The trilogy was re-released on separate two - disc limited edition DVD sets from September 12 to December 31 , 2006 , and again in a limited edition tin box set on November 4 , 2008 ; the original versions of the films were added as bonus material . The release was met with criticism as the unaltered versions were from the 1993 non-anamorphic LaserDisc masters and were not re-transferred using modern video standards . The transfer led to problems with colors and digital image jarring .
