According to the WHO , the `` precautionary principle '' is `` a risk management policy applied in circumstances with a high degree of scientific uncertainty , reflecting the need to take action for a potentially serious risk without awaiting the results of scientific research . '' Other less stringent recommended approaches are prudent avoidance principle and as low as reasonably practicable . Although all of these are problematic in application , due to the widespread use and economic importance of wireless telecommunication systems in modern civilization , there is an increased popularity of such measures in the general public , though also evidence that such approaches may increase concern . They involve recommendations such as the minimization of cellphone usage , the limitation of use by at - risk population ( such as children ) , the adoption of cellphones and microcells with as low as reasonably practicable levels of radiation , the wider use of hands - free and earphone technologies such as Bluetooth headsets , the adoption of maximal standards of exposure , RF field intensity and distance of base stations antennas from human habitations , and so forth . Overall , public information remains a challenge as various health consequences are evoked in the literature and by the media , putting populations under chronic exposure to potentially worrying information .
