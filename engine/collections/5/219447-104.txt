Like its light novel counterpart , the anime has received positive reception for its comedy , parody of the `` trapped in a fantasy world '' subgenre , and faithful adaptation of the light novels . Reviewing the first few episodes , Anime News Network ( ANN ) 's Theron Martin described the second episode as `` the funniest episode of anime I have seen since Monthly Girls ' Nozaki - kun aired '' , while also praising the series ' musical score . The voice acting has also been a subject of praise ; Nick Creamer of ANN commended Sora Amamiya and Rie Takahashi 's roles as Aqua and Megumin for the energy provided in their performances , while Martin applauded Jun Fukushima for his work in voicing Kazuma , considering his dry tone an additional factor in the show 's humor .
