An attempt by the United States military to modify hurricanes in the Atlantic basin using cloud seeding in the 1960s was called Project Stormfury . Only a few hurricanes were tested with cloud seeding because of the strict rules set by the scientists of the project . It was unclear whether the project was successful . Hurricanes appeared to change slightly in structure , but only temporarily . The fear that cloud seeding could potentially change the course or power of hurricanes and negatively affect people in the storm 's path stopped the project .
