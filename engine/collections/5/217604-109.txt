Cleopatra also succeeds in causing Antony to speak in a more theatrical sense and therefore undermine his own true authority . In Act I , scene 1 , Antony not only speaks again of his empire but constructs a theatrical image : `` Let Rome and Tiber melt , and the wide arch / Of the ranged empire fall ... The nobleness of life / Is to do thus ; when such a mutual pair / And such a twain can do 't -- in which I bind / On pain of punishment the world to weet / We stand up peerless . '' Cleopatra immediately says , `` Excellent falsehood ! '' in an aside , indicating to the audience that she intends for Antony to adopt this rhetoric .
