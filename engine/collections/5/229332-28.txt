In road signs in Ireland , the yield sign reads yield in most areas , though in Gaeltacht ( Irish - speaking ) areas , it reads géill slí ( `` yield way '' ) instead . Signs erected before 1997 and still in service read yield right of way , which remains legally permitted . Signs 1956 -- 62 had blank white interior or were hollow .
