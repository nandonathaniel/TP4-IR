In 1837 , Charles Babbage was inspired by Jacquard 's loom to attempt to build the Analytical Engine . The names of the components of the calculating device were borrowed from the textile industry . In the textile industry , yarn was brought from the store to be milled . The device would have had a `` store '' -- memory to hold 1,000 numbers of 40 decimal digits each . Numbers from the `` store '' would then have then been transferred to the `` mill '' ( analogous to the CPU of a modern machine ) , for processing . It was programmed using two sets of perforated cards -- one to direct the operation and the other for the input variables . However , after more than 17,000 pounds of the British government 's money , the thousands of cogged wheels and gears never fully worked together .
