The general trend since 1949 has been to further centralize management in the Department of Defense , elevating the status and authorities of civilian OSD appointees and defense - wide organizations at the expense of the military departments and the services within them . The last major revision of the statutory framework concerning the position was done in the Goldwater -- Nichols Department of Defense Reorganization Act of 1986 . In particular , it elevated the status of joint service for commissioned officers , making it in practice a requirement before appointments to general officer and flag officer grades could be made .
