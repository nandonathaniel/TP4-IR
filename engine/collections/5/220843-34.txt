In July 2004 the European Court of Human Rights ruled that the lack of legal aid in defamation cases , which was the position under the Legal Aid Act 1988 , applicable at the time of the McLibel case , could violate a defendant 's right . The Access to Justice Act 1999 has exceptional funding provisions , which allow the Lord Chancellor to authorise legal aid funding in cases which are otherwise out of scope of the legal aid scheme . A defendant in a position similar to the McLibel defendants could potentially have legal aid assistance if the application met the exceptional funding criteria .
