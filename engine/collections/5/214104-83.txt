No quantitative evidence : There is very little quantitative evidence of the value of centralised PPP coordination units against ministries or government agencies individually procuring PPP projects . Most of the studies available on PPP Units tend to focus on their role and only carry out brief descriptive analyses of their value . Limited Authority : The majority of the PPP Units reviewed in the literature do not play a particularly important role in approving or rejecting PPP programmes or projects . Whilst their advice is used in the decision making process by other government bodies , the majority do not actually have any executive power to make such decisions themselves . Hence , when they have more authority their value is seen to be higher . PPP Units differ by country and sector : Government failures , in regards to PPP units , vary by government . The requirements for PPPs also vary by country and sector and so do the risks involved ( i.e. financial , social etc . ) for the country government . Hence , PPP Units need to be tailored to solve these failures , properly assess risks and be located in the correct government departments where it can command the most power . PPP Units can play a number of important roles in the PPP process ; however , not all PPP Units will play the same role as their functions have been tailored to individual country needs . In some cases , limits to their authority have curtailed their effectiveness . Implicit value : The lack of rigorous evidence does not prove that PPP Units are not an important contributor to the success of a country 's PPP programme . The literature review does show that whilst there is no quantitative data , there are widespread perceptions on the importance of a well - functioning PPP unit for the success of a country 's PPP programme .
