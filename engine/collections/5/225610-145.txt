Hitler 's cabinet issued many decrees for the purpose of Gleichschaltung in the weeks following the passage of the Act . It removed Jews from the civil service ( at Hindenburg 's request , an exception was made for Jews who had served at the front during World War I ) . It banned all trade unions and eventually outlawed all other political parties . After the exiled SPD published its new weekly Neuer Vorwarts in Prague , Hitler banned the party , confiscating its assets and abolishing its parliamentary representation , by decree of 22 June .
