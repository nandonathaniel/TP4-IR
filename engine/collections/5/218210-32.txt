The evolution of the asteroid belt after Late Heavy Bombardment was mainly governed by collisions . Objects with large mass have enough gravity to retain any material ejected by a violent collision . In the asteroid belt this usually is not the case . As a result , many larger objects have been broken apart , and sometimes newer objects have been forged from the remnants in less violent collisions . Moons around some asteroids currently can only be explained as consolidations of material flung away from the parent object without enough energy to entirely escape its gravity .
