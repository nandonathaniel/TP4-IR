Outside of participant motivation , there are other factors that influence the appearance of demand characteristics in a study . Many of these factors relate to the unique nature of the experimental setting itself . For example , participants in studies are more likely to put up with uncomfortable or tedious tasks simply because they are in an experiment . Additionally , the mannerisms of the experimenter , such as the way they greet the participant , or the way they interact with the participant during the course of the experiment may inadvertently bias how the participant responds during the course of the experiment . Finally , prior experiences of being in an experiment , or rumors of the experiment that participants may hear can greatly bias the way they respond . Outside of an experiment , these types of past experiences and mannerisms may have significant effects on how patients rank the effectiveness of their therapist . Many of the ways therapists go about collecting client feedback involve self - report measures , which can be highly influenced by response bias . Participants may be biased if they fill out these measure in front of their therapist , or somehow feel compelled to answer in an affirmative matter because they believe their therapy should be working . In this case , the therapists would not be able to gain accurate feedback from their clients , and be unable to improve their therapy or accurately tailor further treatment to what the participants need . All of these different examples may have significant effects on the responses of participants , driving them to respond in ways that do not reflect their actual beliefs or actual mindset , which negatively impact conclusions drawn from those surveys .
