An example of the interweaving of the teachings on the resurrection with Christian relics is the application of the concept of `` miraculous image formation '' at the moment of resurrection to the Shroud of Turin . Christian authors have stated the belief that the body around whom the shroud was wrapped was not merely human , but divine , and that the image on the shroud was miraculously produced at the moment of resurrection . Quoting Pope Paul VI 's statement that the shroud is `` the wonderful document of His Passion , Death and Resurrection , written for us in letters of blood '' author Antonio Cassanelli argues that the shroud is a deliberate divine record of the five stages of the Passion of Christ , created at the moment of resurrection .
