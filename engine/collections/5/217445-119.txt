Meanwhile , Victor Emmanuel sought a safer means to the acquisition of the remaining Papal territory . He negotiated with the Emperor Napoleon for the removal of the French troops from Rome through a treaty . They agreed to the September Convention in September 1864 , by which Napoleon agreed to withdraw the troops within two years . The Pope was to expand his own army during that time so as to be self - sufficient . In December 1866 , the last of the French troops departed from Rome , in spite of the efforts of the pope to retain them . By their withdrawal , Italy ( excluding Venetia and Savoy ) was freed from the presence of foreign soldiers .
