Even work does not take the pain away . I may be diving for my own pleasure or showing others how to do so , but when I return to the shop , it seems empty without you . I stock and order as I always did , but even now , I sometimes glance over my shoulder without thinking and call for you . As I write this note to you , I wonder when , or if , things like that will ever stop .
