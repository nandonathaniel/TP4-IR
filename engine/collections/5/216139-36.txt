Treasury managers wished to halt monetary expansion in 1936 by stagnating gold and increasing reserve requirements . For all intents and purposes , this led to a freeze of the monetary system and U.S. economy . The Treasury began its own gold sterilization policy in order to stop inflation from potentially increasing due to an increase in inflow of gold into the U.S. soon after the Fed enacted the same policy . Gold holdings more than doubled in the period of 1935 to 1940 . This lasted for 16 months from 1936 to 1938 . In more efforts , as of the end of 1936 , the Treasury noted its gold purchases as part of `` inactive '' account . In other words , the Treasury met the price of gold through sales of government securities in financial markets in order to keep the pile of gold high but they would not be converted into currency in the Treasury .
