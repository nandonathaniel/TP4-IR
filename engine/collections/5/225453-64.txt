On 9 September 1999 , the Reuters and AP wire services reported that Argosy International Ltd. , headed by Graham Jessop , son of the undersea explorer Keith Jessop , and sponsored by the National Underwater and Marine Agency ( NUMA ) , had discovered Carpathia 's wreck in 600 ft ( 180 m ) of water , 185 mi ( 298 km ) west of Land 's End . Bad weather forced his ship to abandon the position before Jessop could verify the discovery using underwater cameras . However , when he returned to the location the wreck was the Hamburg - America Line 's Isis , sunk on 8 November 1936 .
