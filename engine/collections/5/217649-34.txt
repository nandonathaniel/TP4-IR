Regardless , the `` re-discovery '' made Mendelism an important but controversial theory . Its most vigorous promoter in Europe was William Bateson , who coined the terms `` genetics '' and `` allele '' to describe many of its tenets . The model of heredity was contested by other biologists because it implied that heredity was discontinuous , in opposition to the apparently continuous variation observable for many traits . Many biologists also dismissed the theory because they were not sure it would apply to all species . However , later work by biologists and statisticians such as Ronald Fisher showed that if multiple Mendelian factors were involved in the expression of an individual trait , they could produce the diverse results observed , and thus showed that Mendelian genetics is compatible with natural selection . Thomas Hunt Morgan and his assistants later integrated Mendel 's theoretical model with the chromosome theory of inheritance , in which the chromosomes of cells were thought to hold the actual hereditary material , and created what is now known as classical genetics , a highly successful foundation which eventually cemented Mendel 's place in history .
