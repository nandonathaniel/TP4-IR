A political outsider , the 41 - year old Tallmadge conceived his amendment based on a personal aversion to slavery . He had played a leading role in accelerating emancipation of the remaining slaves in New York in 1817 . Moreover , he had campaigned against Illinois ' Black Codes : though ostensibly free - soil , the new Illinois state constitution permitted indentured servitude and a limited form of slavery . As a New York Republican , Tallmadge maintained an uneasy association with Governor DeWitt Clinton , a former Republican who depended on support from ex-Federalists . Clinton 's faction was hostile to Tallmadge for his spirited defense of General Andrew Jackson over his contentious invasion of Florida .
