Two single - celled haploid gametes , each containing n unpaired chromosomes , fuse to form a single - celled diploid zygote , which now contains n pairs of chromosomes , i.e. 2n chromosomes in total . The single - celled diploid zygote germinates , dividing by the normal process ( mitosis ) , which maintains the number of chromosomes at 2n . The result is a multi-cellular diploid organism , called the sporophyte ( because at maturity it produces spores ) . When it reaches maturity , the sporophyte produces one or more sporangia ( singular : sporangium ) which are the organs that produce diploid spore mother cells ( sporocytes ) . These divide by a special process ( meiosis ) that reduces the number of chromosomes by a half . This initially results in four single - celled haploid spores , each containing n unpaired chromosomes . The single - celled haploid spore germinates , dividing by the normal process ( mitosis ) , which maintains the number of chromosomes at n . The result is a multi-cellular haploid organism , called the gametophyte ( because it produces gametes at maturity ) . When it reaches maturity , the gametophyte produces one or more gametangia ( singular : gametangium ) which are the organs that produce haploid gametes . At least one kind of gamete possesses some mechanism for reaching another gamete in order to fuse with it .
