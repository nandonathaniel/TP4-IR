To further their religious appeal , the Muslim League also launched efforts to entice Pirs towards their cause . Pirs dominated the religious landscape , and were individuals who claimed to inherit religious authority from Sufi Saints who had proselytised in the region since the eleventh century . By the twentieth century , most Punjabi Muslims offered allegiance to a Pir as their religious guide , thus providing them considerable political influence . The Unionists had successfully cultivated the support of Pirs to achieve success in the 1937 elections , and the Muslim League now attempted to replicate their method of doing so . To do so , the Muslim League created the Masheikh Committee , used Urs ceremonies and shrines for meetings and rallies and encouraged fatwas urging support for the Muslim League . Reasons for the pirs switching allegiance varied . For the Gilani Pirs of Multan the over-riding factor was local longstanding factional rivalries , whilst for many others a shrines size and relationship with the government dictated its allegiance .
