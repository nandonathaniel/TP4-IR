The legendary Sesostris ( likely either Pharaoh Senusret II or Senusret III of the Twelfth dynasty of Egypt ) may have started work on an ancient canal joining the Nile with the Red Sea ( 1897 BC -- 1839 BC ) , when an irrigation channel was constructed around 1850 BC that was navigable during the flood season , leading into a dry river valley east of the Nile River Delta named Wadi Tumelat . ( It is said that in ancient times the Red Sea reached northward to the Bitter Lakes and Lake Timsah . )
