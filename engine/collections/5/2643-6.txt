For example , at the gene locus for the ABO blood type carbohydrate antigens in humans , classical genetics recognizes three alleles , I , I , and i , that determine compatibility of blood transfusions . Any individual has one of six possible genotypes ( I I , I i , I I , I i , I I , and ii ) that produce one of four possible phenotypes : `` Type A '' ( produced by I I homozygous and I i heterozygous genotypes ) , `` Type B '' ( produced by I I homozygous and I i heterozygous genotypes ) , `` Type AB '' produced by I I heterozygous genotype , and `` Type O '' produced by ii homozygous genotype . ( It is now known that each of the A , B , and O alleles is actually a class of multiple alleles with different DNA sequences that produce proteins with identical properties : more than 70 alleles are known at the ABO locus . Hence an individual with `` Type A '' blood may be an AO heterozygote , an AA homozygote , or an AA heterozygote with two different `` A '' alleles . )
