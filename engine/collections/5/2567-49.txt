The most complicated song , `` Walk Through the Fire '' , leads all the characters to the climax from different locations for different reasons , reminiscent of the `` Tonight Quintet '' from West Side Story . When they all sing the chorus at once to the line `` We will walk through the fire / And let it -- burn '' , two fire trucks race behind the Scoobies as they proceed to the Bronze . Whedon called the shot the `` single greatest thing we ever did '' . Each of the singers in this song , which `` marries soft rock to the function of a dirge '' , connects musically to earlier songs while foreshadowing Buffy 's next number and the final chorus , providing an ominous anxiety .
