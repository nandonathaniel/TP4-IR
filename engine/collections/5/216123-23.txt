Much trade in the forest kingdoms was done at the local level , typically by ordinary Yoruba people at local markets . In some towns these were held every 3 or 4 days . Cloth , vegetables , meat , and other goods were traded , and paid for using small seashells called cowries which were imported from East Africa . Bars of copper and iron , called manilas , were produced in standard shapes to be used as currency . Other items used in trade as a form of currency included salt , cloth , and bars of gold .
