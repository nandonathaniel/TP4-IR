Following the 2004 -- 05 NHL lockout , the Maple Leafs experienced their longest playoff drought in the club 's history . They struggled in the 2005 -- 06 season ; despite a late - season surge ( 9 -- 1 -- 2 in their final 12 games ) , led by goaltender Jean - Sebastien Aubin , Toronto was out of playoff contention for the first time since 1998 . This marked the first time the team had missed the postseason under Quinn , who was later relieved as head coach . Quinn 's dismissal was controversial since many of the young players who were key contributors to the Leafs ' late - season run had been drafted by him before Ferguson 's arrival , while Ferguson 's signings ( Jason Allison , Belfour , Alexander Khavanov , and Eric Lindros ) had suffered season - ending injuries .
