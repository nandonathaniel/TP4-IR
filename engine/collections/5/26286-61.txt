In the first half of the 7th century , Caucasian Albania , as a vassal of the Sasanians , came under nominal Muslim rule due to the Muslim conquest of Persia . The Umayyad Caliphate repulsed both the Sasanians and Byzantines from Transcaucasia and turned Caucasian Albania into a vassal state after Christian resistance led by King Javanshir , was suppressed in 667 . The power vacuum left by the decline of the Abbasid Caliphate was filled by numerous local dynasties such as the Sallarids , Sajids , and Shaddadids . At the beginning of the 11th century , the territory was gradually seized by waves of Oghuz Turks from Central Asia . The first of these Turkic dynasties established was the Seljuk Empire , who entered the area now known as Azerbaijan by 1067 .
