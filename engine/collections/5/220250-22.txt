The novelization bears a major difference in the form of a prologue explaining the backstory behind the film 's events . It is presented as an entry of the Journal of the Whills . This prologue contains the first - ever reference to the Emperor 's true name , Palpatine . The section dealing with Palpatine says , `` Aided and abetted by restless , power - hungry individuals within the government , and the massive organs of commerce , the ambitious Senator Palpatine caused himself to be elected President of the Republic . He promised to reunite the disaffected among the people and to restore the remembered glory of the Republic . Once secure in office he declared himself Emperor , shutting himself away from the populace . Soon he was controlled by the very assistants and boot - lickers he had appointed to high office , and the cries of the people for justice did not reach his ears . '' This implies that the Emperor is merely a victim of manipulation by Imperial bureaucrats rather than the true string - puller , which is at odds with Palpatine 's depiction in later films in the series . This is because George Lucas had not fully developed the character at this point in time , allowing Alan Dean Foster to expand upon the Emperor as he saw fit . Lucas ' conception of the character continued to evolve , until he eventually determined that Palpatine was Darth Vader 's master and the true personification of evil in The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi .
