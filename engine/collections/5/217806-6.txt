Starting in 1986 , the United States established several temporary immigrant visa programs outside of the usual immigration preferences ( family members or by employment ) . The first program was NP - 5 , run from 1987 - 89 , where a limited number of visas was issued on a first - come , first - served basis . The second program was OP - 1 , run through a lottery from 1989 - 91 and available for natives of countries with low levels of recent immigration to the United States . The third program , AA - 1 , from 1992 - 94 , was available for natives from a select group of countries that had been `` adversely affected '' by earlier immigration laws . Intentionally and in practice , people from Ireland and Northern Ireland benefited disproportionately from these programs . They were also known as the Donnelly , Berman and Morrison visas , respectively , after the sponsoring congressmen . The Government of Ireland has actively supported the various lottery bills and similar legislation since their inception .
