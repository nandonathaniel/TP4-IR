Over the course of his lifetime Granville Woods would obtain more than 50 patents for inventions including an automatic brake and an egg incubator and for improvements to other inventions such as safety circuits , telegraph , telephone , and phonograph . He died on January 30 , 1910 in New York City , having sold a number of his devices to such companies as Westinghouse , General Electric and American Engineering . Until 1975 , his resting place was an unmarked grave , but historian M.A. Harris helped to raise funds , and persuaded several of the corporations that used Woods 's inventions to donate towards a headstone . It was erected at St. Michael 's Cemetery in Elmhurst , Queens NY .
