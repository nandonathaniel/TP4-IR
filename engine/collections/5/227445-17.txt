Merle is noticeably kept in line by the Governor , a sharp contrast to his nature in the Atlanta group . In the episode `` Hounded '' , Merle allows Michonne to leave Woodbury at the Governor 's orders , but in the next episode , `` Say the Word '' , the Governor sends Merle to lead a posse to hunt down Michonne . He wounds her and she kills members of the posse , but when Michonne escapes into the red zone , Merle calls off the hunt , reporting to the Governor that he killed her . Later on , Merle runs into Glenn and Maggie from the Atlanta group . He asks them to take him to Daryl . They refuse , so he holds Maggie hostage and demands Glenn drive them to Woodbury . In the episode `` When the Dead Come Knocking '' , Merle unsuccessfully tortures Glenn to obtain the location of the group , including beating Glenn and leaving him locked in a room with a walker and tied to a chair . In the episode `` Made to Suffer '' , Rick 's group infiltrates Woodbury and rescues Glenn and Maggie , Michonne attacks the Governor ; furious at losing an eye and his reanimated daughter to a woman Merle reported as dead , he publicly accuses Merle of treason and reveals that he has captured Daryl . In the episode `` The Suicide King '' , the Governor orders Merle and Daryl to fight to the death , but they are saved by Rick and Maggie , who attack Woodbury . When Merle begins to insult the group , Rick knocks him out . Rick 's group decides not to include Merle because of his attitude and his transgressions against Maggie and Glenn , but Daryl opts to leave the group to join Merle , refusing to leave his brother behind again .
