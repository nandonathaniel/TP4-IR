On August 10 , 1932 , Rin Tin Tin died at Duncan 's home on Club View Drive in Los Angeles . Duncan wrote about the death in his unpublished memoir : He heard Rin Tin Tin bark in a peculiar fashion so he went to see what was wrong . He found the dog lying on the ground , moments away from death . Newspapers across the nation carried obituaries . Magazine articles were written about his life , and a special Movietone News feature was shown to movie audiences . In the press , the death was given a wide variety of fabrications such as Rin Tin Tin dying on the set of the film Pride of the Legion ( where Rin Tin Tin Jr. was working ) , dying at night , and dying at home on the front lawn in the arms of actress Jean Harlow , who lived on the same street . In a private ceremony , Duncan buried Rin Tin Tin in a bronze casket in his own backyard with a plain wooden cross to mark the location . Duncan was suffering the financial effects of the Great Depression and could not afford a finer burial , nor even his own expensive house . He sold his house and quietly arranged to have the dog 's body returned to his country of birth for reburial in the Cimetière des Chiens et Autres Animaux Domestiques , the famous pet cemetery in the Parisian suburb of Asnières - sur - Seine .
