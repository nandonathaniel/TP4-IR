For this reason between the sixteenth and eighteenth centuries many families who belonged to the social class of the hidalgos adopted the surname Andrade as a tool to acquire something of this prestige . For this reason , the surname Andrade is very common throughout Galicia , although this point does not mean a real kinship with the noble family of the Counts of Andrade .
