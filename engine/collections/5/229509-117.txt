Liberal democracy traces its origins -- and its name -- to the European 18th - century , also known as the Age of Enlightenment . At the time , the vast majority of European states were monarchies , with political power held either by the monarch or the aristocracy . The possibility of democracy had not been a seriously considered political theory since classical antiquity and the widely held belief was that democracies would be inherently unstable and chaotic in their policies due to the changing whims of the people . It was further believed that democracy was contrary to human nature , as human beings were seen to be inherently evil , violent and in need of a strong leader to restrain their destructive impulses . Many European monarchs held that their power had been ordained by God and that questioning their right to rule was tantamount to blasphemy .
