Site - clearing and prep began early 1992 . A sinkhole led to the site 's being moved slightly . The tower 's interior and exterior design took inspiration from existing Southern California landmarks , including the Biltmore Hotel and Mission Inn . The distinctive Spanish Colonial Revival architectural features on and around the attraction 's roof were designed so that the rear facade , which is visible from Epcot , would blend seamlessly with the skyline of the Morocco Pavilion in Epcot 's World Showcase Lagoon . After construction ended , the ride was set to open on July 4 , 1994 ; but the Tower of Terror opened on July 22 , 1994 , along with the Sunset Boulevard thoroughfare .
