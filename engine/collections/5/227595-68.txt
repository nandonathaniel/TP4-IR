An OLED display works without a backlight . Thus , it can display deep black levels and can be thinner and lighter than a liquid crystal display ( LCD ) . In low ambient light conditions such as a dark room an OLED screen can achieve a higher contrast ratio than an LCD , whether the LCD uses cold cathode fluorescent lamps or LED backlight . OLEDs are expected to replace other forms of display in near future .
