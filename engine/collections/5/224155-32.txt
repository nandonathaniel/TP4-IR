Photography on private property that is generally open to the public ( e.g. , a shopping mall ) is usually permitted unless explicitly prohibited by posted signs . Even if no such signs are posted , the property owner or agent can ask a person to stop photographing , and if the person refuses to do so , the owner or agent can ask the person to leave ; in some jurisdictions , a person who refuses to leave can be arrested for criminal trespass , and many jurisdictions recognize the common - law right to use reasonable force to remove a trespasser ; a person who forcibly resists a lawful removal may be liable for battery , assault , or both .
