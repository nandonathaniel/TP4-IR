All of the vehicles found on Main Street , U.S.A. , grouped together as the Main Street Vehicles attraction , were designed to accurately reflect turn - of - the - century vehicles , including a 3 ft ( 914 mm ) gauge tramway featuring horse - drawn streetcars , a double - decker bus , a fire engine , and an automobile . They are available for one - way rides along Main Street , U.S.A. The horse - drawn streetcars are also used by the park entertainment , including The Dapper Dans . The horseless carriages are modeled after cars built in 1903 , and are two - cylinder , four - horsepower ( 3 kW ) engines with manual transmission and steering . Walt Disney used to drive the fire engine around the park before it opened , and it has been used to host celebrity guests and in the parades . Most of the original main street vehicles were designed by Bob Gurr .
