The traditional authors are : Peter the apostle ( First and Second Peter ) ; the author of the Gospel of John ( First , Second and Third John ) , writing in advanced age ; `` Jude , a servant of Jesus Christ and a brother of James '' ( Epistle of Jude ) ; and James the Just , `` a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ '' ( James ) . In fact 1 John is anonymous , and 2 and 3 John identify their author only as `` the Elder . '' Though 2 Peter states its author as `` Simon Peter , a servant and apostle of Jesus Christ '' , most scholars today regard this as pseudonymous , and many hold the same opinion of James , 1 Peter and Jude .
