Encroaching troops of the Roman Empire in 106 AD forced the Nabataeans to surrender . The Romans annexed and renamed the Kingdom to Arabia Petraea . Petra 's importance declined as sea trade routes emerged , and after a 363 earthquake destroyed many structures . The Byzantine Era witnessed the construction of several Christian churches . By 700 , the city became an abandoned place where only a handful of nomads grazed goats . It remained unknown to Europeans until it was rediscovered in 1812 by Swiss explorer Johann Ludwig Burckhardt , who had read the historical descriptions of Petra and concluded that `` there is no other ruin between the extremities of the Dead sea and Red sea , of sufficient importance to answer to that city '' .
