From 1991 to 1993 the two teams were designated `` AFC '' and `` NFC '' to distinguish where their coaching staffs were from and to stress the professional nature of the game . This was confusing to some , as the game occurred well before the NFL draft and there was no way of determining which conference the players were actually going to wind up in to start their professional careers . In 1994 this was dropped and the designations were reverted to the traditional `` North vs. South '' format .
