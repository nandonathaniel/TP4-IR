Founded in 1909 , the Canadiens are the longest continuously operating professional ice hockey team worldwide , and the only existing NHL club to predate the founding of the NHL . One of the oldest North American professional sports franchises , the Canadiens ' history predates that of every other Canadian franchise outside football as well as every American franchise outside baseball and the National Football League 's Arizona Cardinals . The franchise is one of the `` Original Six '' teams , a description used for the teams that made up the NHL from 1942 until the 1967 expansion . The team 's championship season in 1992 -- 93 was the last time a Canadian team won the Stanley Cup .
