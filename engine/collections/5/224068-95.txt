In discussing various stylings of `` Loop '' and `` L '' in Destination Loop : The Story of Rapid Transit Railroading in and around Chicago ( 1982 ) , author Brian J.

'' Cudahy then comments , `` Note that in the quotation above ... it says ' El ' to mean ' elevated rapid transit railroad . ' We trust that this usage can be ascribed to a publisher 's editor in New York or some other east coast city ; in Chicago the same expression is routinely rendered ' L ' . ''
