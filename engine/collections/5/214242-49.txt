The easiest method to perform this technique is the needle cricothyrotomy ( also referred to as a percutaneous dilational cricothyrotomy ) , in which a large - bore ( 12 -- 14 gauge ) intravenous catheter is used to puncture the cricothyroid membrane . Oxygen can then be administered through this catheter via jet insufflation . However , while needle cricothyrotomy may be life - saving in extreme circumstances , this technique is only intended to be a temporizing measure until a definitive airway can be established . While needle cricothyrotomy can provide adequate oxygenation , the small diameter of the cricothyrotomy catheter is insufficient for elimination of carbon dioxide ( ventilation ) . After one hour of apneic oxygenation through a needle cricothyrotomy , one can expect a PaCO of greater than 250 mm Hg and an arterial pH of less than 6.72 , despite an oxygen saturation of 98 % or greater . A more definitive airway can be established by performing a surgical cricothyrotomy , in which a 5 to 6 mm ( 0.20 to 0.24 in ) endotracheal tube or tracheostomy tube can be inserted through a larger incision .
