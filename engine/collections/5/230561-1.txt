In common parlance , the term jet engine loosely refers to an internal combustion airbreathing jet engine . These typically feature a rotating air compressor powered by a turbine , with the leftover power providing thrust via a propelling nozzle -- this process is known as the Brayton thermodynamic cycle . Jet aircraft use such engines for long - distance travel . Early jet aircraft used turbojet engines which were relatively inefficient for subsonic flight . Modern subsonic jet aircraft usually use more complex high - bypass turbofan engines . These engines offer high speed and greater fuel efficiency than piston and propeller aeroengines over long distances .
