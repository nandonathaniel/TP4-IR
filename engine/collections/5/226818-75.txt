Aware of the military importance of Jersey , the British government had ordered that the island be heavily fortified . On 6 January 1781 , a French invasion force of 2,000 men set out to take over the island , but only half of the force arrived and landed . The Battle of Jersey lasted about half an hour , with Britain successfully defending the island . There were about thirty casualties on each side , and the British took 600 French prisoners whom were subsequently sent to England . Both British and French commanders were slain .
