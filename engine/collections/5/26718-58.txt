Newton 's laws are applied to objects which are idealised as single point masses , in the sense that the size and shape of the object 's body are neglected to focus on its motion more easily . This can be done when the object is small compared to the distances involved in its analysis , or the deformation and rotation of the body are of no importance . In this way , even a planet can be idealised as a particle for analysis of its orbital motion around a star .
