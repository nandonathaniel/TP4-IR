Hong Kong 's University Grants Committee adopted an outcomes - based approach to teaching and learning in 2005 . No specific approach was created leaving universities to design the approach themselves . Universities were also left with a goal of ensuring an education for their students that will contribute to social and economic development , as defined by the community in which the university resides . With little to no direction or feedback from the outside universities will have to determine if their approach is achieving its goals on their own .
