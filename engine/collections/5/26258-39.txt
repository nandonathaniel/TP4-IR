The game primarily uses the touchscreen to control Maxwell and other objects ; the developers considered using the directional pad of the DS but realized that they would still need to rely on the touchscreen for certain actions and thus focused most of the game 's controls through that interface . The game includes 5th Cell 's own handwriting recognition system for writing down objects which Slaczka considered to be better than Nintendo 's own system for Brain Age . The team included a virtual keyboard in addition to this system knowing that even `` the human brain ca n't understand chicken scratch '' .
