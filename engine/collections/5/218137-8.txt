One measure of human development is the Human Development Index ( HDI ) , formulated by the United Nations Development Programme . The index encompasses statistics such as life expectancy at birth , an education index ( calculated using mean years of schooling and expected years of schooling ) , and gross national income per capital . Though this index does not capture every aspect that contributes to human capability , it is a standardized way of quantifying human capability across nations and communities . Aspects that could be left out of the calculations include incomes that are unable to be quantified , such as staying home to raise children or bartering goods / services , as well as individuals ' perceptions of their own well being . Other measures of human development include the Human Poverty Index ( HPI ) and the Gender Empowerment Measure . It measures many aspects of development .
