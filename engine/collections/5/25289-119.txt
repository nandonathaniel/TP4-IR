The Phone - a-Friend lifeline provided multiple instances of controversy during the show 's run . A 2002 edition of the Daily Mail reported that many contestants had selected strangers who were `` contacts among the quizzing fraternity '' to act as their Phone - a-Friends . Specifically , game show champion Daphne Fowler was approached by a man she had not previously met and asked if she would be his lifeline in exchange for £ 200 . Fowler refused , adding : `` I thought a fair price would be a quarter of whatever the man won , so if I helped him get from £ 32,000 to £ 64,000 I would expect to get £ 16,000 . '' The man was later revealed by ITV sources not to have made it onto the programme .
