The NFL Network is embroiled in disputes with several cable providers . Perhaps the most public controversy is over its removal on some systems owned by Time Warner Cable , the second - largest system in the United States , which occurred in September 2006 and lasted until September 2012 . That provider pulled the network from systems that it had purchased from Adelphia Communications and its February 2012 purchase of Insight Communications after those providers ' agreements expired .
