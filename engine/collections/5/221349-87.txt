If genetic differentiation between populations develops , gene flow between populations can introduce traits or alleles which are disadvantageous in the local population and this may lead to organisms within these populations evolving mechanisms that prevent mating with genetically distant populations , eventually resulting in the appearance of new species . Thus , exchange of genetic information between individuals is fundamentally important for the development of the biological species concept .
