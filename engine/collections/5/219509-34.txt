The Bremer River at Ipswich , 30 kilometres ( 19 mi ) west of Brisbane , reached a height of 19.4 metres ( 64 ft ) on 12 January , inundating the central business district and at least 3,000 houses . One third of the city was reported to be underwater and over 1,100 people took shelter at evacuation centres . At Minden , on the border of Ipswich City , a four - year - old boy was swept away by floodwaters when he fell from a rescue boat . A man in his fifties died when he accidentally drove into floodwaters in the Ipswich suburb of Wulkuraka . The worst affected areas of Ipswich were the suburbs of Goodna and Gailes . The flooding allowed bull sharks to reach the center of Goodna ; one was spotted swimming in Williams Street , and a second in Queen Street .
