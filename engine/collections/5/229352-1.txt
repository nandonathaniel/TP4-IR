Biblical scholar Kenneth Kitchen argues that , from the conquest of Canaan by Joshua until the formation of the first Kingdom of Israel and Judah ( ca . 1150 -- 1025 BC ) , the Israelite tribes formed a loose confederation . No central government existed in this confederation ; in times of crisis , the people were led by ad hoc chieftains , known as judges ( shoftim ) .
