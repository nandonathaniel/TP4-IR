The Battle of Sabine Pass was of little tactical or strategic significance to the Civil War . A Confederate supply line from Mexico to Texas was never established , and in any case it could not have effectively supplied the states east of the Mississippi once the Union controlled the whole of that river after its victory at Vicksburg in July . The Confederacy was therefore forced to continue its reliance on blockade running to import valuable materials and resources .
