Nonetheless , some historians believe that Columbus sent three distinct letters : one the Catholic Monarchs ( the manuscript copy ) , another to Luis de Santangel ( origin of the printed Spanish editions ) , and a third to Gabriel Sanchez ( origin of the Latin editions ) . In other words , that the Santangel and Sanchez letters , although practically identical , are nonetheless distinct . However , this leave open the question of why Columbus would have sent a separate letter to Gabriel Sanchez , treasurer of Aragon , with whom he was not intimate , nor was particularly involved in the Indies enterprise , nor any more influential in court than Santangel or some other people Columbus might have addressed .
