On August 16 , 2009 , `` about a dozen '' people were noted by police to be openly carrying firearms at a health care rally across the street from a Veterans of Foreign Wars Convention in the Phoenix Convention Center , where President Barack Obama was giving an address . While the Secret Service was `` very much aware '' of these individuals , Arizona law does not prohibit open carry . No crimes were committed by these protesters , and no arrests were made . In an interview with Fox News , commentator James Wesley Rawles characterized the Phoenix protesters as `` merely exercising a pre-existing right '' . When he was asked about open carry , `` but ... without a permit ? '' Rawles opined , `` We have a permit -- it is called the Second Amendment . ''
