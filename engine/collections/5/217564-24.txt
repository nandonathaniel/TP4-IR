Porter 's father - in - law posted bail to keep him out of jail . He was due to stand trial on July 7 , 1896 , but the day before , as he was changing trains to get to the courthouse , an impulse hit him . He fled , first to New Orleans and later to Honduras , with which the United States had no extradition treaty at that time . William lived in Honduras for only six months , until January 1897 . There he became friends with Al Jennings , a notorious train robber , who later wrote a book about their friendship . He holed up in a Trujillo hotel , where he wrote Cabbages and Kings , in which he coined the term `` banana republic '' to qualify the country , a phrase subsequently used widely to describe a small , unstable tropical nation in Latin America with a narrowly focused , agrarian economy .
