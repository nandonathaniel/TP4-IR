In Islam , no verse in the Quran supports male or female circumcision ( FGM / C ) . Male circumcision is a widespread practice and considered mandatory for Muslim males according to Sunnah . Muslim scholars disagree whether any authentic Sunnah in the hadiths supports the practice of female circumcision . The Ijma , or consensus of Muslim scholars , varies by the Islamic jurisprudence ( fiqh ) on whether circumcision is optional , honorable or obligatory for Muslim male and females . Prominent Islamic scholars have both supported and opposed FGM / C for female Muslims .
