In small `` closed '' lakes in Belarus and the Bryansk region of Russia , concentrations in a number of fish species varied from 100 to 60,000 Bq / kg during the period 1990 -- 92 . The contamination of fish caused short - term concern in parts of the UK and Germany and in the long term ( years rather than months ) in the affected areas of Ukraine , Belarus , and Russia as well as in parts of Scandinavia .
