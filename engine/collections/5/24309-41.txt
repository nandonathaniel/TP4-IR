One effect of the salary cap was the release of many higher - salaried veteran players to other teams once their production started to decline from the elite level . On the other hand , many teams have made a practice of using free agents to restock with better personnel more suited to the team . The salary cap prevented teams with superior finances from engaging in the formerly widespread practice of stocking as much talent on the roster as possible by placing younger players on reserve lists with false injuries while they develop into NFL - capable players . In this respect , the cap functions as a supplement to the 55 - man roster limit and practice squad limits .
