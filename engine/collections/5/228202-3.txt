Hardy Ames - Hill ( born 1970 ) was a Bouncer from York , Pennsylvania . Hardy and his older brother , Brady , were raised by his grandparents in York . He went to Indiana University of Pennsylvania . Hardy formed a close friendship with Kent , Krista , and Nicole early on . He took a strong dislike towards the Chilltown group , and often stated that it was his goal in the game to evict them from the house . He most notably clashed with Shannon in the house , with Shannon at one point using Hardy 's toothbrush to clean the toilet . Hardy was seen as a strong gameplayer , winning a total of three consecutive Head of Household competition . This gave Hardy the record for most consecutive Head of Household wins , a record he held until Ian Terry broke the record in 2012 . Though Hardy had close friendships in the house , he ultimately turned against former allies such as Krista and Kent to further himself in the game . Upon turning on the TOP alliance , Hardy formed an alliance with Nicole and Will . This ultimately hurt his game , however , when Will cast the sole vote to evict Hardy on Day 68 . Hardy came in fourth place , and voted for Nicole to win . Since appearing on the series , Hardy has gone on to do minor work in film and television . He appeared on an episode of Big Brother : All - Stars ( 2006 ) to participate in a Power of Veto competition . Hardy , along with several other former HouseGuests , appeared as himself on a Big Brother themed episode of the CBS sitcom Yes Dear ( 2000 -- 06 ) in 2003 . He later moved to Miami , and in 2007 was listed as one of `` America 's Most Eligible Bachelor 's '' by Extra . Hardy has since become a multi-business owner , and has gotten married .
