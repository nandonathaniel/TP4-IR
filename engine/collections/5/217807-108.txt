El Niño is a warm ocean current originating along the coast of Peru that replaces the usual cold Humboldt Current . The warm surface water moving toward the coast of Peru with El Niño is pushed west by the trade winds , thereby raising the temperature of the southern Pacific Ocean . The reverse condition is known as La Niña .
