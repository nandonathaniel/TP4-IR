From all the information I have , 95 per cent of Kashmir Muslims do not wish to be or remain Indian citizens . I doubt therefore the wisdom of trying to keep people by force where they do not wish to stay . This can not but have serious long - term political consequences , though immediately it may suit policy and please public opinion .
