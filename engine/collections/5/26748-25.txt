Most personal walkie - talkies sold are designed to operate in UHF allocations , and are designed to be very compact , with buttons for changing channels and other settings on the face of the radio and a short , fixed antenna . Most such units are made of heavy , often brightly colored plastic , though some more expensive units have ruggedized metal or plastic cases . Commercial - grade radios are often designed to be used on allocations such as GMRS or MURS ( the latter of which has had very little readily available purpose - built equipment ) . In addition , CB walkie - talkies are available , but less popular due to the propagation characteristics of the 27 MHz band and the general bulkiness of the gear involved .
