Texting on a phone distracts participants , even when the texting task used is a relatively simple one . Stavrinos et al. investigated the effect of other cognitive tasks , such as engaging in conversations or cognitive tasks on a phone , and found that participants actually have reduced visual awareness . This finding was supported by Licence et al. , who conducted a similar study . For example , texting pedestrians may fail to notice unusual events in their environment , such as a unicycling clown . These findings suggest that tasks that require the allocation of cognitive resources can affect visual attention even when the task itself does not require the participants to avert their eyes from their environment . The act of texting itself seems to impair pedestrians ' visual awareness . It appears that the distraction produced by texting is a combination of both a cognitive and visual perceptual distraction . A study conducted by Licence et al. supported some of these findings , particularly that those who text while walking significantly alter their gait . However , they also found that the gait pattern texters adopted was slower and more `` protective '' , and consequently did not increase obstacle contact or tripping in a typical pedestrian context .
