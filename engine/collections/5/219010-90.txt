According to the April 1907 issue of the Scientific American magazine , the Wright brothers seemed to have the most advanced knowledge of heavier - than - air navigation at the time . However , the same magazine issue also claimed that no public flight had been made in the United States before its April 1907 issue . Hence , they devised the Scientific American Aeronautic Trophy in order to encourage the development of a heavier - than - air flying machine .
