During observations in Germany , dingoes were heard to produce a sound that observers have called Schrappen . It was only observed in an agonistic context , mostly as a defence against obtrusive pups or for defending resources . It was described as a bite intention , during which the receiver is never touched or hurt . Only a clashing of the teeth could be heard .
