In this case , the Solid State Logic 4000 mixing board had a `` reverse talk - back '' circuit ( labeled on the board as `` Listen Mic '' ) . Normal `` talkback '' is a button that the mixing engineer has to press in order to talk to the recording musicians ( the recording and the mixing parts of a studio are , otherwise , completely sonically isolated ) . Reverse talkback is a circuit ( also button - activated ) for the engineer to listen to musicians in the studio . In order to compensate for sound level differences -- people can be close to the reverse talkback microphone or far off -- this circuit has a compressor on it , which minimizes the differences between loud and soft sounds . While recording `` Intruder '' for his ex-bandmate Peter Gabriel 's third solo album , at some point Collins started playing the drums while the reverse talkback was activated . Engineer Hugh Padgham was amazed at the sound achieved . Overnight , they rewired the board so that the reverse talkback could be recorded in a more formal manner . Later models of the SSL 4000 allowed the listen mic to be recorded with the touch of a button .
