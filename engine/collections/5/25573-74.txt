The refractive index of air is close to , but just greater than 1 . Systematic variations in refractive index can lead to the bending of light rays over long optical paths . One example is that , under some circumstances , observers onboard ships can see other vessels just over the horizon because light is refracted in the same direction as the curvature of Earth 's surface .
