Queen are one of the most bootlegged bands ever , according to Nick Weymouth , who manages the band 's official website . A 2001 survey discovered the existence of 12,225 websites dedicated to Queen bootlegs , the highest number for any band . Bootleg recordings have contributed to the band 's popularity in certain countries where Western music is censored , such as Iran . In a project called Queen : The Top 100 Bootlegs , many of these have been made officially available to download for a nominal fee from Queen 's website , with profits going to the Mercury Phoenix Trust . Rolling Stone ranked Queen at number 52 on its list of the `` 100 Greatest Artists of All Time '' , while ranking Mercury the 18th greatest singer , and May the twenty - sixth greatest guitarist . Queen were named 13th on VH1 's 100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock list , and in 2010 were ranked 17th on VH1 's 100 Greatest Artists of All Time list . In 2012 , Gigwise readers named Queen the best band of the past 60 years .
