The way adolescents perceive their parents ' authority as legitimate largely impacts how much they feel obligated to disclose to them . The more authority the children believe their parents rightly possess , the more obligation they perceive to share their lives accordingly . Parents who attempt a large degree of psychological control over their children are unlikely to be disclosed to as frequently , which only makes logical sense given the fact that most children are searching for a sense of autonomy . Interestingly , the adolescents have been found to feel the most obligation to tell their parents about such activities as drinking and smoking but less need to disclose information about personal issues . Not surprising either , less obligation is felt as age increases . Contrary to popular belief though , most adolescents in the US do not consider themselves to be adults between the ages of 18 and 27 , and their parents feel the same way . The age at which children feel they no longer are obligated to disclose to their parents has increased over time , and the same trend is predicted over the next few decades .
