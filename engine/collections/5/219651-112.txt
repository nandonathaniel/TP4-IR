The other characters of the story include the sailors in chapter 1 and the people of Nineveh in chapter 3 . These characters are also contrasted to Jonah 's passivity . While Jonah sleeps in the hull , the sailors pray and try to save the ship from the storm ( 1 : 4 -- 6 ) . While Jonah passively finds himself forced to act under the Divine Will , the people of Nineveh actively petition God to change his mind .
