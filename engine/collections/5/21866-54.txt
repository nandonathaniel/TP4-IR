It was agreed that the Amu Darya river would form the border between Afghanistan and the Russian empire . Russia gained full possession of all of the Pamir Mountains , except for Taghdumbash , which would be the subject of a later Afghan - China agreement . To conclude their agreement , one peak was named Mount Concord . In exchange for a British agreement to use the term Nicholas Range in honor of the Emperor Nicholas II of Russia on official maps , the Russians agreed to refer to Lake Zorkul as Lake Victoria in honor of Queen Victoria of England .
