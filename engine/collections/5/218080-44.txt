At the Hillsborough -- Pasco county line ( south of SR 56 ( Exit 275 ) ) , I - 275 rejoins I - 75 ( at Exit 274 , southbound only ) and I - 75 changes into a southwest -- northeast trajectory as it passes through Pasco , Hernando , and Sumter Counties where it runs through parts of the Withlacoochee State Forest on its way to the junction with Florida 's Turnpike . Widened median segments exist in Northern Pasco County , Hernando County , and in Sumter County north of County Road 476 - B ( Exit 309 ) . Some of these median segments are actually considered part of the Withlacoochee State Forest itself . The Withlacoochee State Trail runs beneath I - 75 between US 98 / SR 50 ( Exit 301 ) and the Hernando -- Sumter County line , where it also crosses over the Withlacoochee River . All of Interstate 75 from the Georgia border to Tampa , Florida is three lanes , unless closed for construction . This is to accommodate for the immense number of tourists and vacationers that come to Florida .
