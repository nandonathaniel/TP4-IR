Ty Burr of the Boston Globe gave the film a perfect four star rating , describing it as `` ridiculously satisfying '' , and the `` best prequel ever '' . Burr praised the character development in the film , opining that `` emotionally , Star Trek hits every one of its marks , functioning as a family reunion that extends across decades , entertainment mediums , even blurring the line between audience and show . '' He continued : `` Trading on affections sustained over 40 years of popular culture , Star Trek does what a franchise reboot rarely does . It reminds us why we loved these characters in the first place . '' Owen Gleiberman from Entertainment Weekly gave the film an ' A - ' grade , commenting that director Abrams `` crafts an origin story that avoids any hint of the origin doldrums . '' Similar sentiments were expressed by Rolling Stone journalist Peter Travers , who gave the film a 3.5 out of 4 stars . He felt that the acting from the cast was the highlight of the filming , asserting that the performance of Pine radiated star quality . Likewise , Travers called Quinto 's performance `` sharp '' and `` intuitive '' , and felt that Quinto `` gave the film a soul '' . Manohla Dargis of the New York Times wrote , `` Star Trek ( ... ) is n't just a pleasurable rethink of your geek uncle 's favorite science - fiction series . It 's also a testament to television 's power as mythmaker , as a source for some of the fundamental stories we tell about ourselves , who we are and where we came from . Slate 's Dana Stevens felt that the film was `` a gift to those of us who loved the original series , that brainy , wonky , idealistic body of work that aired to almost no commercial success between 1966 -- 69 and has since become a science fiction archetype and object of cult adoration . '' Time Out London 's Tom Huddleston praised the aesthetic qualities of the film , such as the design of Enterprise , and praised the performances of the cast . He wrote , `` The cast are equally strong : Quinto brings wry charm to an otherwise calculating character , while Pine powers through his performance in bullish , if not quite Shatner-esque fashion .
