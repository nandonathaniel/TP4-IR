Bison latifrons ( giant bison or longhorn bison ) is thought to have evolved in midcontinent North America from B. priscus , after the steppe bison crossed into North America . Giant bison ( B. latifrons ) appeared in the fossil record around 500,000 years ago . B. latifrons was one of many species of North American megafauna which became extinct during the Quaternary extinction event . It is thought to have disappeared some 21,000 -- 30,000 years ago , during the late Wisconsin glaciation .
