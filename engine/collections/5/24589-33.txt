The gray wolf has very dense and fluffy winter fur , with short underfur and long , coarse guard hairs . Most of the underfur and some of the guard hairs are shed in the spring and grow back in the autumn period . The longest hairs occur on the back , particularly on the front quarters and neck . Especially long hairs are on the shoulders , and almost form a crest on the upper part of the neck . The hairs on the cheeks are elongated and form tufts . The ears are covered in short hairs , which strongly project from the fur . Short , elastic and closely adjacent hairs are present on the limbs from the elbows down to the calcaneal tendons . The winter fur is highly resistant to cold ; wolves in northern climates can rest comfortably in open areas at − 40 ° by placing their muzzles between the rear legs and covering their faces with their tail . Wolf fur provides better insulation than dog fur , and does not collect ice when warm breath is condensed against it . In warm climates , the fur is coarser and scarcer than in northern wolves . Female wolves tend to have smoother furred limbs than males , and generally develop the smoothest overall coats as they age . Older wolves generally have more white hairs in the tip of the tail , along the nose and on the forehead . The winter fur is retained longest in lactating females , though with some hair loss around their nipples . Hair length on the middle of the back is 60 -- 70 mm ( 2.4 -- 2.8 in ) . Hair length of the guard hairs on the shoulders generally does not exceed 90 mm ( 3.5 in ) , but can reach 110 -- 130 mm ( 4.3 -- 5.1 in ) .
