I went down to Wyatt Earp 's house and told him that Ike Clanton had threatened that when him and his brothers and Doc Holliday showed themselves on the street that the ball would open . '' Ike said in his testimony afterward that he remembered neither meeting Boyle nor making any such statements that day . Deputy Marshal Andy Bronk also heard the talk around town . He woke Virgil , who listened , and went back to sleep . Ike 's ongoing threats were not worth losing sleep .
