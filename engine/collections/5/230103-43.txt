Some scholars argued that the development of Chavín social complexities coincided with the cultivation of maize and development of agricultural surpluses . Through an analysis of carbon isotope in the human bones found at Chavín sites , researchers have proved that the diet consisted mainly of C foods such as potatoes and quinoa , while maize , a C food , was not a part of the main diet . Potato and quinoa were crops better adapted to the Chavín environment . They are more resistant to the frost and irregular rain fall associated with high - altitude environments . Maize would not have been able to thrive in such conditions .
