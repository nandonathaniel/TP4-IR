In the September 11 , 2001 , attacks , after hijacked United Airlines Flight 175 penetrated through the South Tower of The World Trade Center , part of the plane 's landing gear and fuselage came out the north side of the tower and crashed through the roof and two of the floors of the Burlington Coat Factory at 45 -- 47 Park Place , between West Broadway and Church Street , ( 600 feet ( 180 meters ) ) north of the former World Trade Center . The store had been the company 's first location in Manhattan , opened in 1991 . Three floor beams of the top floor of the building were destroyed , causing major structural damage . Nearly nine years later , the building was part of a national controversy , as efforts to build a Muslim center and mosque at the site as the `` Cordoba House '' sparked protest .
