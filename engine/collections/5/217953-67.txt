CP is not a progressive disorder ( meaning the brain damage does not worsen ) , but the symptoms can become more severe over time . A person with the disorder may improve somewhat during childhood if he or she receives extensive care , but once bones and musculature become more established , orthopedic surgery may be required . The full intellectual potential of a child born with CP will often not be known until the child starts school . People with CP are more likely to have learning disabilities , although these may be unrelated to IQ , including varying degrees of intellectual disability . Intellectual level among people with CP varies from genius to intellectually impaired , as it does in the general population , and experts have stated that it is important not to underestimate the capabilities of a person with CP and to give them every opportunity to learn .
