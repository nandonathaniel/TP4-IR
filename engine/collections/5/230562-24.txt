While the mid-1980s spinoff series The Flintstone Kids depicts Barney as a child , the series seems to be mostly apocryphal due to its presenting Barney as a childhood friend of Wilma and Betty ( versus the original series ' assertion that they first met as young adults ) . Still , the series ' assertions that Barney has at least one younger brother , Dusty , was a childhood friend of Fred , and was the son of artist Flo Rubble and car dealer Robert `` Honest Bob '' Rubble might be taken as valid . It is suggested in the original series that Barney grew up at 142 Boulder Avenue in Granitetown . The original series also suggested in one episode that Barney was the nephew of Fred 's boss , Mr. Slate , though subsequent episodes and spinoffs do not seem to support this claim . As young adults , Barney and Fred worked as bellhops at a resort , where they first met Wilma and Betty , who were working as cigarette girls . Eventually , Barney married Betty ( as Fred did Wilma ) .
