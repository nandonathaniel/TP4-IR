Another example is the French dialect dubbing of The Simpsons , which is entirely different in Quebec and France , the humor being very different for each audience ( see Non-English versions of The Simpsons ) . Audiences in Quebec are generally critical of France 's dubbing of The Simpsons , which they often do not find amusing . The French - language Télétoon network once aired the Quebec dub for The Simpsons , as well as Parisian French dubs of Futurama and Family Guy , which were both similar to the Parisian dub for The Simpsons . The two latter shows have since been taken off the network , while The Simpsons continues its run on Télétoon .
