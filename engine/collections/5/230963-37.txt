A second group of Scouts and Raiders , code - named Special Service Unit No. 1 , was established on 7 July 1943 , as a joint and combined operations force . The first mission , in September 1943 , was at Finschhafen in Papua New Guinea . Later operations were at Gasmata , Arawe , Cape Gloucester , and the east and south coasts of New Britain , all without any loss of personnel . Conflicts arose over operational matters , and all non-Navy personnel were reassigned . The unit , renamed 7th Amphibious Scouts , received a new mission , to go ashore with the assault boats , buoy channels , erect markers for the incoming craft , handle casualties , take offshore soundings , clear beach obstacles and maintain voice communications linking the troops ashore , incoming boats and nearby ships . The 7th Amphibious Scouts conducted operations in the Pacific for the duration of the conflict , participating in more than 40 landings .
