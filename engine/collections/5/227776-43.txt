Note : Six of the eight Ivy League universities consider their founding dates to be simply the date that they received their charters and thus became legal corporations with the authority to grant academic degrees . Harvard University uses the date that the legislature of the Massachusetts Bay Colony formally allocated funds for the creation of a college . Harvard was chartered in 1650 , although classes had been conducted for approximately a decade by then . The University of Pennsylvania initially considered its founding date to be 1750 ; this is the year which appears on the first iteration of the university seal . Later in Penn 's early history , the university changed its officially recognized founding date to 1749 , which was used for all of the nineteenth century , including a centennial celebration in 1849 . In 1899 , Penn 's board of trustees formally adopted a third founding date of 1740 , in response to a petition from Penn 's General Alumni Society . Penn was chartered in 1755 , the same year collegiate classes began . `` Religious affiliation '' refers to financial sponsorship , formal association with , and promotion by , a religious denomination . All of the schools in the Ivy League are private and not currently associated with any religion .
