During the nine hours of vigorous eruptive activity , about 540,000,000 tons of ash fell over an area of more than 22,000 square miles ( 57,000 km ) . The total volume of the ash before its compaction by rainfall was about 0.3 cubic miles ( 1.3 km ) . The volume of the uncompacted ash is equivalent to about 0.05 cubic miles ( 210,000,000 m ) of solid rock , or about 7 % of the amount of material that slid off in the debris avalanche . By around 5 : 30 p.m. on May 18 , the vertical ash column declined in stature , but less severe outbursts continued through the next several days .
