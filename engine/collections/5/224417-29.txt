The nerve begins the process by destroying the nerve distal to the site of injury allowing Schwann cells , basal lamina , and the neurilemma near the injury to begin producing a regeneration tube . Nerve growth factors are produced causing many nerve sprouts to bud . When one of the growth processes finds the regeneration tube , it begins to grow rapidly towards its original destination guided the entire time by the regeneration tube . Nerve regeneration is very slow and can take up to several months to complete . While this process does repair some nerves , there will still be some functional deficit as the repairs are not perfect .
