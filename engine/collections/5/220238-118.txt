Despite its curious alignment , in other respects the Uranian magnetosphere is like those of other planets : it has a bow shock at about 23 Uranian radii ahead of it , a magnetopause at 18 Uranian radii , a fully developed magnetotail , and radiation belts . Overall , the structure of Uranus 's magnetosphere is different from Jupiter 's and more similar to Saturn 's . Uranus 's magnetotail trails behind it into space for millions of kilometres and is twisted by its sideways rotation into a long corkscrew .
