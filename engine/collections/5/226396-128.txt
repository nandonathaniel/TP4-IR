In Season 5 , Forstman appears in the episode ' Uninvited Guests ' when Harvey visits him in prison to confront him about funding Daniel Hardman 's renewed run at taking over the firm . Forstman admits to providing Hardman with full power of attorney over his assets for the duration of his prison sentence . But it becomes clear that there is a gap between Hardman 's and Forstman 's objectives ; Hardman is using Forstman as a blank checkbook to target the firm 's clients for hostile takeover and eroding Jessica 's base of support among the senior partners in order to take over the firm from her . But Forstman is shown to be willing to ditch Hardman and cut off all of his funding immediately in exchange for Harvey 's resignation from the firm . In the next episode ' Faith ' after significant thought and consulting his therapist for advice , Harvey agrees to resign , and is shown at the vote of no confidence meeting presenting proof of Forstman 's termination of Hardman 's representation services .
