The species was first described by Elias Magnus Fries as Agaricus semilanceatus in his 1838 Epicrisis Systematis Mycologici . Paul Kummer transferred it to Psilocybe in 1871 when he raised many of Fries 's sub-groupings of Agaricus to the level of genus . Panaeolus semilanceatus , named by Jakob Emanuel Lange in both 1936 and 1939 publications , is a synonym . According to the taxonomical database MycoBank , several taxa once considered varieties of P. semilanceata are synonymous with the species now known as Psilocybe strictipes : the caerulescens variety described by Pier Andrea Saccardo in 1887 ( originally named Agaricus semilanceatus var . coerulescens by Mordecai Cubitt Cooke in 1881 ) , the microspora variety described by Rolf Singer in 1969 , and the obtusata variety described by Marcel Bon in 1985 .
