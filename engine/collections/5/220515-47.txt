In the 8th century the inrush of the Vikings in force began to be felt all over Pictland . These Vikings were pagans and savages of the most unrestrained and pitiless type . They were composed of Finn - Gall or Norwegians , and of Dubh - Gall or Danes . The latter were a mixed breed , with a Hunnish strain in them .
