The Punta Gorda Public Library was established in 1908 , making it the oldest branch of the Charlotte County Library System , which was created in 1963 . The library was initially contained within an Episcopal Church rectory and was supervised by the vicar 's wife , Theodosia Trout , until 1909 . The church that first housed this library still stands across the street today , under the name of the Church of the Good Shepherd . The library was eventually moved due to its popularity interfering with church activities .
