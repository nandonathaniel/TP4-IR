The h - index is an author - level metric that attempts to measure both the productivity and citation impact of the publications of a scientist or scholar . The index is based on the set of the scientist 's most cited papers and the number of citations that they have received in other publications . The index can also be applied to the productivity and impact of a scholarly journal as well as a group of scientists , such as a department or university or country . The index was suggested in 2005 by Jorge E. Hirsch , a physicist at UCSD , as a tool for determining theoretical physicists ' relative quality and is sometimes called the Hirsch index or Hirsch number .
