During the later Steve Allen years , regular audience member Lillian Miller ( usually referred to as `` Miss Miller '' ) became such an integral part that she was forced to join American Federation of Television and Radio Artists , the television / radio performers union . She would continue to perform the same service for most of the major talk shows for decades , including those hosted by Paar , Carson , Merv Griffin ( until 1986 ) , and Mike Douglas , among others .
