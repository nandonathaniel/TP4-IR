However , Mikko Tuhkanen claims that the apparently civilized qualities of Tarzan , such as his interest in reading , threaten his survival as a human in the jungle . For Tuhkanen , Tarzan represents the fluidity with which humans should define themselves . He asserts , `` ( T ) he human and the nonhuman become grotesquely indistinguishable '' in the novel . Humans mistake apes for other humans , an ape tries to rape Jane , Tarzan finds a surrogate ape mother when he cries out like an ape , and he must act against his human instincts by jumping into a dangerous body of water in order to survive an attack from a lion . Because simian and human behavior blend , and because civilized habits seem to threaten human survival , Tuhkanen claims that humans must contradict the expectations of civilization regarding the characteristics of humans . For Tuhkanen , the novel exemplifies `` queer ethics , '' encouraging `` perverse sexuality '' along with other behaviors which Western civilization often discouraged .
