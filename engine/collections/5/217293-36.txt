According to Will Friedwald , this song is an example of Charles vocalizing in what would ordinarily be a generally extraneous manner for dramatic effect by using a different voice than he had ever previously exhibited . He sang `` ... not just using the squeak -- using a whole new kind of squeak , in fact -- for additional coloring on the sidelines , but making it the heart of the matter , literally squeaking out the words and notes in harmony with the Raelettes '' ( his background singers ) .
