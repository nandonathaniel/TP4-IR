Director Ardolino was adamant that they choose dancers who could also act , as he did not want to use the `` stand - in '' method that had been used with Flashdance ( 1983 ) . For the female lead of Frances `` Baby '' Houseman , Bergstein chose the 26 - year - old Jennifer Grey , daughter of the Oscar - winning actor and dancer Joel Grey ( e.g. , of the film Cabaret ( 1972 ) ) , who , like her father , was a trained dancer . They then sought a male lead , initially considering 20 - year - old Billy Zane , who had the visual look desired ( originally the Johnny character was to be Italian and have a dark exotic look ) , but initial dancing tests when he was partnered with Grey did not meet expectations . The next choice was 34 - year - old Patrick Swayze , who had been noticed for his roles in Grandview , U.S.A. ( 1984 ) and Red Dawn ( 1984 ) . He was a seasoned dancer , with experience from the Joffrey Ballet . The producers were thrilled with him , but his agent was opposed to the idea . However , Swayze read the script , liked the multi-level character of Johnny , and took the part anyway , and Johnny was changed from being Italian to Irish . Grey was initially not happy about the choice , as she and Swayze had difficulty getting along on Red Dawn , but when they did their dancing screen test , the chemistry between them was obvious . Bergstein described it as `` breathtaking '' .
