Among those considered for the title role of Django , Michael K. Williams and Will Smith were mentioned as possibilities , but in the end Jamie Foxx was cast in the role . Smith later said he turned down the role because it `` was n't the lead '' . Tyrese Gibson sent in an audition tape as the character . Franco Nero , the original Django from the 1966 Italian film , was rumored for the role of Calvin Candie , but instead was given a cameo appearance as a minor character . Nero suggested that he play a mysterious horseman who haunts Django in visions and is revealed in an ending flashback to be Django 's father ; Tarantino opted not to use the idea . Kevin Costner was in negotiations to join as Ace Woody , a Mandingo trainer and Candie 's right - hand man , but Costner dropped out due to scheduling conflicts . Kurt Russell was cast instead but also later left the role . When Kurt Russell dropped out , the role of Ace Woody was not recast ; instead , the character was merged with Walton Goggins 's character , Billy Crash .
