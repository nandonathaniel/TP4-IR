The gravitational force from object A upon B will vary with distance , being greatest at the nearest surface to A and least at the most distant . This creates a gravitational gradient across object B that will distort its equilibrium shape slightly . The body of object B will become elongated along the axis oriented toward A , and conversely , slightly reduced in dimension in directions orthogonal to this axis . The elongated distortions are known as tidal bulges . ( For the solid Earth , these bulges can reach displacements of up to around 0.4 metres ( 1.3 ft ) . ) When B is not yet tidally locked , the bulges travel over its surface due to orbital motions , with one of the two `` high '' tidal bulges traveling close to the point where body A is overhead . For large astronomical bodies that are nearly spherical due to self - gravitation , the tidal distortion produces a slightly prolate spheroid , i.e. an axially symmetric ellipsoid that is elongated along its major axis . Smaller bodies also experience distortion , but this distortion is less regular .
