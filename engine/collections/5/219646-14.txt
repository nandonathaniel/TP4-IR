The development of color photography required greater refinement of effects techniques . Color enabled the development of such travelling matte techniques as bluescreen and the sodium vapour process . Many films became landmarks in special - effects accomplishments : Forbidden Planet used matte paintings , animation , and miniature work to create spectacular alien environments . In The Ten Commandments , Paramount 's John P. Fulton , A.S.C. , multiplied the crowds of extras in the Exodus scenes with careful compositing , depicted the massive constructions of Rameses with models , and split the Red Sea in a still - impressive combination of travelling mattes and water tanks . Ray Harryhausen extended the art of stop - motion animation with his special techniques of compositing to create spectacular fantasy adventures such as Jason and the Argonauts ( whose climax , a sword battle with seven animated skeletons , is considered a landmark in special effects ) .
