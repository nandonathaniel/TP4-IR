Later Aldrin commented on the event : `` Perhaps , if I had it to do over again , I would not choose to celebrate communion . Although it was a deeply meaningful experience for me , it was a Christian sacrament , and we had come to the Moon in the name of all mankind -- be they Christians , Jews , Muslims , animists , agnostics , or atheists . But at the time I could think of no better way to acknowledge the enormity of the Apollo 11 experience than by giving thanks to God . '' Mindful of the controversy caused by the Bible readings made by the Apollo 8 crew , the NASA management had warned the Apollo 11 crew against making any explicit religious comments during the flight . However , in the final Apollo 11 TV broadcast during the return journey to Earth , Aldrin quoted from Psalm 8 ( verses 3 and 4 ) `` I 've been reflecting the events of the past several days and a verse from the Psalms comes to mind to me . ' When I consider the heavens , the work of thy fingers , the moon and the stars which thou hast ordained , what is man that thou art mindful of him ? ' '' .
