The ER has a central role in producing , processing , and transporting biochemical compounds for use inside and outside of the cell . Its membrane is the site of production of all the transmembrane proteins and lipids for most of the cell 's organelles , including the ER itself , the Golgi apparatus , lysosomes , endosomes , mitochondria , peroxisomes , secretory vesicles , and the plasma membrane . Furthermore , almost all of the proteins that will exit the cell , plus those destined for the lumen of the ER , Golgi apparatus , or lysosomes , are originally delivered to the ER lumen . Consequently , many of the proteins found in the cisternal space of the endoplasmic reticulum lumen are there only temporarily as they pass on their way to other locations . Other proteins , however , constantly remain in the lumen and are known as endoplasmic reticulum resident proteins . These special proteins contain a specialized retention signal made up of a specific sequence of amino acids that enables them to be retained by the organelle . An example of an important endoplasmic reticulum resident protein is the chaperon protein known as BiP which identifies other proteins that have been improperly built or processed and keeps them from being sent to their final destinations .
