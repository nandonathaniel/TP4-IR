Erwin Chemerinsky , then of Duke Law School and now dean of the University of California , Berkeley School of Law , argued that the District of Columbia 's handgun laws , even assuming an `` individual rights '' interpretation of the Second Amendment , could be justified as reasonable regulations and thus upheld as constitutional . Professor Chemerinsky believes that the regulation of guns should be analyzed in the same way `` as other regulation of property under modern constitutional law '' and `` be allowed so long as it is rationally related to achieving a legitimate government purpose . '' However , the dicta in Heller suggests that applying a mere rational basis analysis is an incorrect reading of the Constitution and would , in fact , defeat the entire purpose of the Second Amendment .
