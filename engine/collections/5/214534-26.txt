The on - screen representation of the T - 3000 was made by British effects company Double Negative . Footage combines Jason Clarke filmed on set , keyframed animation , and motion capture . Supervisor Peter Bebb said that the company tried to design the T - 3000 like a computer would do it , focusing on design and battle efficiency , `` form follows function '' . Given it is a Terminator built out of a human , the result is `` a pure robot that sits under flesh structure '' , still retaining an overall human shape . The mechanical cells tried to resemble the material on stealth aircraft , with a result described as `` more matte than metal '' , resembling a slightly iridescent ceramic carbon .
