The training structure has been transformed in order to streamline command and control . Instead of multiple training divisions , each with its own geographic area of responsibility , the new structure features four training commands responsible for specific categories of training throughout the United States . Each command is configured for either initial entry training , advanced individual training schools , leader development or battle command training . These commands train soldiers of the Army Reserve , Army National Guard and the active component , through formal classroom and `` hands on '' training . Two training support commands under the First United States Army , designated First Army East and First Army West , provide customized , realistic unit - specific and operation - specific training . Training Support Commands ( TSC ) plan , conduct and evaluate training exercises for Army , Army Reserve and Army National Guard units . TSC are organized under the United States First Army into two subordinate units .
