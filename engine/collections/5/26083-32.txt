Some reviewers , however , share mixed to negative opinion concerning the shows format . DVD Verdict writer Adam Arseneau wrote positively about the season , praising the actors ' performances , the family dynamic and the multi-generational police family plot while deeming the family dinners and the lessons doled out from them `` smacks of self - righteousness and lazy writing . '' Arseneau concluded about the season , `` If we had genuinely solid material to engage the Reagans , Blue Bloods could be one of the best cop shows on television . As it stands , it rarely transcends average . '' David Brown from Radio Times gave the season release three stars ( out of five ) , writing `` Imagine something that mixes the best elements of Law & Order and Brothers & Sisters and you get the idea . '' The Guardian writer Michael Hann wrote negatively of the series , noting that `` one can know what is happening without even watching the show , since each episode follows the same template . ''
