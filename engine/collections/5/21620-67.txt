Today , the Irrawaddy is still the country 's most important commercial waterway . Despite Mandalay 's position as the chief rail and highway focus in northern Burma , a considerable amount of passenger and goods traffic moves by river . As the Irrawaddy Delta is one of the world 's major rice - growing areas , one of the most important goods transported is rice . Teak logs -- Myanmar is one of the world 's top exporters -- are floated down the river as large rafts . Before it is transported , teak has to be seasoned , because otherwise it wo n't float . This happens by girdling , a practice where a deep circular cut through bark and sap is made into the heartwood . Other major goods that are transported from the nation 's heartlands to Yangon for export are other foodstuffs , petroleum , cotton , and local commodities .
