Phase distortion , Group delay , and Phase delay A perfect audio component will maintain the phase coherency of a signal over the full range of frequencies . Phase distortion can be extremely difficult to reduce or eliminate . The human ear is largely insensitive to phase distortion , though it is exquisitely sensitive to relative phase relationships within heard sounds . The complex nature of our sensitivity to phase errors , coupled with the lack of a convenient test that delivers an easily understood quality rating , is the reason that it is not a part of conventional audio specifications . Multi-driver loudspeaker systems may have complex phase distortions , caused or corrected by crossovers , driver placement , and the phase behaviour of the specific driver .
