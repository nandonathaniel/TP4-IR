Durkheim was also deeply preoccupied with the acceptance of sociology as a legitimate science . He refined the positivism originally set forth by Auguste Comte , promoting what could be considered as a form of epistemological realism , as well as the use of the hypothetico - deductive model in social science . For him , sociology was the science of institutions , if this term is understood in its broader meaning as `` beliefs and modes of behaviour instituted by the collectivity '' and its aim being to discover structural social facts . Durkheim was a major proponent of structural functionalism , a foundational perspective in both sociology and anthropology . In his view , social science should be purely holistic ; that is , sociology should study phenomena attributed to society at large , rather than being limited to the specific actions of individuals .
