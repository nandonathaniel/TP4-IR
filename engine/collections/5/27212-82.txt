The first observations of the Jovian atmosphere at higher resolution than possible with Earth - based telescopes were taken by the Pioneer 10 and 11 spacecraft . The first truly detailed images of Jupiter 's atmosphere were provided by the Voyagers . The two spacecraft were able to image details at a resolution as low as 5 km in size in various spectra , and also able to create `` approach movies '' of the atmosphere in motion . The Galileo Probe , which suffered an antenna problem , saw less of Jupiter 's atmosphere but at a better average resolution and a wider spectral bandwidth .
