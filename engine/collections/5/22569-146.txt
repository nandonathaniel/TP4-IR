African slaves were not bought or sold in London but were brought by masters from other areas . Together with people from other nations , especially non-Christian , Africans were considered foreigners , not able to be English subjects . At the time , England had no naturalization procedure . The African slaves ' legal status was unclear until 1772 and Somersett 's Case , when the fugitive slave James Somersett forced a decision by the courts . Somersett had escaped , and his master , Charles Steuart , had him captured and imprisoned on board a ship , intending to ship him to Jamaica to be resold into slavery . While in London , Somersett had been baptized ; three godparents issued a writ of habeas corpus . As a result , Lord Mansfield , Chief Justice of the Court of the King 's Bench , had to judge whether Somersett 's abduction was lawful or not under English Common Law . No legislation had ever been passed to establish slavery in England . The case received national attention , and five advocates supported the action on behalf of Somersett .
