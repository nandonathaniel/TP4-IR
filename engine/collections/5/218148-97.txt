The system of stochocracy has been proposed as an improved system compared to the system of representative democracy , where representatives are elected . Stochocracy aims to at least reduce this degradation by having all representatives appointed by lottery instead of by voting . Therefore , this system is also called lottocracy . The system was proposed by the writer Roger de Sizif in 1998 in his book La Stochocratie . Choosing officeholders by lot was also the standard practice in ancient Athenian democracy . The rationale behind this practice was to avoid lobbying and electioneering by economic oligarchs .
