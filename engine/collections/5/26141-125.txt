South India has two distinct styles of rock architecture , the Dravidian style of Tamil Nadu and the Vesara style of Karnataka . The temples considered of porches or mantapas preceding the door leading to the sanctum , gate - pyramids or gopurams , which are the principal features in the quadrangular enclosures that surround the more notable temples and pillared halls used for many purposes and are the invariable accompaniments of these temples . Besides these , a South Indian temple typically has a tank called the Kalyani or Pushkarni . The gopuram is a monumental tower , usually ornate at the entrance of any temple in Southern India . This forms a prominent feature of koil s , Hindu temples of the Dravidian style . They are topped by the kalasam , a spherical stone finial , and function as gateways through the walls that surround the temple complex . The origins of the gopuram can be traced back to early structures of the Pallavas and by the twelfth century , under the Pandya rulers , these gateways became a dominant feature of a temple 's outer appearance , eventually overshadowing the inner sanctuary which became obscured from view by the colossal size of the gopuram .
