Following periods of consultation with the local community , and several rounds of negotiations with Haringey Council and then - Mayor of London , Boris Johnson , planning permissions for the project were issued in September 2011 . A compulsory purchase order ( CPO ) issued in July 2014 giving approval for the new stadium scheme to proceed was subject to an unsuccessful legal challenge in February 2015 . During the long CPO delays , the current designs were developed and the new planning application was approved for them by Haringey Council on 17 December 2015 . The anticipated stadium opening date has been revised several times and is currently scheduled for the 2018 -- 19 season .
