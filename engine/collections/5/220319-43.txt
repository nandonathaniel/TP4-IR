The Last Jedi follows immediately after the events of The Force Awakens , and the narrative narrowly focuses on the First Order 's fleet attacking and chasing the Resistance from their only base ( on the planet D'Qar ) . As a result , the First Order 's intended galaxy - wide offensive against the decapitated New Republic is only alluded to in passing -- and indeed , has only just begun , given that the events of The Last Jedi itself only span a few days or weeks .
