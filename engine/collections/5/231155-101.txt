Near the ending of `` The Darkest Knight '' , Jenna and Noel both attempt to murder the Liars , partly for their own reasons but to also avenge Charlotte , whom according to Kahn `` taught them a lot '' . During the cat - and - mouse chase , Noel ends up stumbling upon an axe that decapitates his head and Marshall is knocked down by Mary Drake just as she was about to shoot Spencer Hastings . Once the Liars stumble upon Spencer being cradled on Mary 's arms , they deduce she 's accountable for their friend 's critical condition . Mary swears she 'd never harm Spencer as she tearfully claims to be her birth mother , thus revealing that Spencer is Charlotte 's biological sister .
