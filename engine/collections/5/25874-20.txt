Billy 's grandfather enters him into a championship coon hunt , putting him against experienced hunters and the finest dogs in the country . Before it starts , he enters Little Ann into a conformation contest , where she wins the silver cup . On the fourth night of the hunt , Old Dan and Little Ann tree three raccoons , making it to the final round . The sixth night , they tree one before a blizzard hits . Billy , his father , grandfather , and the judge lose sight of the dogs . When they finally find them , Billy 's grandfather sprains his ankle . They build a fire , and when Billy 's father chops down a tree , three raccoons jump out . Old Dan and Little Ann take two of them down , and chase the third to another tree . In the morning , the hunters find them covered with ice circling the tree . That raccoon wins them the championship , gold cup , and $300 of jackpot money .
