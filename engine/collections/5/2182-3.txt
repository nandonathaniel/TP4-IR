Studies on human brain size , largely based on participants of European ancestry , tend to find an average adult brain volume of 1260 cubic centimeters ( cm ) for men and 1130 cm for women . There is , however , substantial variation between individuals ; one study of 46 adults , aged 22 -- 49 years and of mainly European descent , found an average brain volume of 1273.6 cm for men , with a range of 1052.9 to 1498.5 cm , and 1131.1 cm for women , with a range of 974.9 to 1398.1 cm .
