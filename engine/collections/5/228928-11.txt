As a wealthy and powerful nation with limited winemaking resources , England had a marked influence on the development of sparkling Champagne . Non-sparkling Champagne became popular in London society following the arrival of epicurean Charles de Saint - Évremond in 1661 . At parties and banquets , Saint - Évremond feverishly promoted the wines of the Champagne region . Soon some of the most powerful and fashionable men of London , such as the Duke of Bedford and the Duke of Buckingham as well as the Earl of Arlington were making regular orders of cases of Champagne . The wine was non-sparkling , or at least it was intended to be . Wine was often transported to England in wooden wine barrels and merchant houses would then bottle the wine for sale . During the 17th century , English glassmakers used coal - fueled ovens and produced stronger , more durable glass bottles than wood - fired French glass . The English also rediscovered the use of cork stoppers , once used by the Romans but forgotten for centuries after the fall of the Western Roman Empire . During the cold winters of the Champagne region , temperatures would drop so low that the fermentation process was prematurely halted , leaving some residual sugar and dormant yeast . When the wine was shipped to and bottled in England , the fermentation process would restart when the weather warmed and the cork - stoppered wine would begin to build pressure from carbon dioxide gas . When the wine was opened , it would be bubbly .
