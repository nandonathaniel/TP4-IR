Debussy was known for his meticulousness in the arrangement of his preludes . Pianist and musical writer Paul Roberts asserts that this prelude , along with the two that immediately precede it , forms `` the central arch '' of Book I 's structure , since the three pieces provide the most `` dramatic contrast '' out of all the preludes in the first book . The sixth prelude , Des pas sur la neige ( Footprints in the Snow ) , evokes a feeling of sadness and isolation , while Ce qu'a vu le vent d'ouest ( What the West wind saw ) -- the seventh -- exudes a violent and tumultuous nature . In stark contrast to these two , La fille brings about a sense of gentle `` lyricism '' and `` warmth '' , which is uncharacteristic of Debussy 's music of this kind . By placing these three preludes in this particular order , Debussy ensured that arguably the most technically challenging prelude of the collection ( Vent d'ouest ) was situated in - between the two that are the simplest to play out of the twenty - four .
