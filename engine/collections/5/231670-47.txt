At T + 58.788 , a tracking film camera captured the beginnings of a plume near the aft attach strut on the right SRB . Unknown to those on Challenger or in Houston , hot gas had begun to leak through a growing hole in one of the right - hand SRBs joints . The force of the wind shear shattered the temporary oxide seal that had taken the place of the damaged O - rings , removing the last barrier to flame passing through the joint . Had it not been for the wind shear , the fortuitous oxide seal might have held through booster burnout .
