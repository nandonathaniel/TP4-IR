Engine vacuum is the difference between the pressures in the intake manifold and ambient atmospheric pressure . Engine vacuum is a `` gauge '' pressure , since gauges by nature measure a pressure difference , not an absolute pressure . The engine fundamentally responds to air mass , not vacuum , and absolute pressure is necessary to calculate mass . The mass of air entering the engine is directly proportional to the air density , which is proportional to the absolute pressure , and inversely proportional to the absolute temperature .
