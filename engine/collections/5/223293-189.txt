The dominant language of Anglo - America is English . French is also official in Canada , where it is the predominant language in Quebec and an official language in New Brunswick along with English . It is also an important language in Louisiana , and in parts of New Hampshire , Maine , and Vermont . Spanish has kept an ongoing presence in the Southwestern United States , which formed part of the Viceroyalty of New Spain , especially in California and New Mexico , where a distinct variety of Spanish spoken since the 17th century has survived . It has more recently become widely spoken in other parts of the United States because of heavy immigration from Latin America . High levels of immigration in general have brought great linguistic diversity to Anglo - America , with over 300 languages known to be spoken in the United States alone , but most languages are spoken only in small enclaves and by relatively small immigrant groups .
