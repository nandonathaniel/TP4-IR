From the end of the Civil War , African Americans primarily favored the Republican Party due to its overwhelming political and more tangible efforts in achieving the abolition of slavery , particularly through President Lincoln 's Emancipation Proclamation . The South had long been a Democratic stronghold , favoring a state 's right to legal slavery . In addition , the ranks of the fledgling Ku Klux Klan were composed almost entirely of white Democrats who were angry over the poor treatment they had received at the hands of northerners and who were also bent on reversing the policies of Reconstruction . However , African Americans began drifting to the Democratic Party when Franklin D. Roosevelt was elected president . Support for the Civil Rights Movement in the 1960s by Democratic Presidents John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson helped give the Democrats even larger support among the African American community , which consistently vote between 85 - 95 % Democratic .
