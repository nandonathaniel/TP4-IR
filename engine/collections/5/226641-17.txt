On 6 January 1937 , the first opportunity after the winter break , both houses of Congress in the United States passed a resolution banning the export of arms to Spain . Those in opposition to the bill , including American socialists , communists and even many liberals , suggested that the export of arms to Germany and Italy should be halted also under the Neutrality Act of 1935 , since foreign intervention constituted a state of war in Spain . Cordell Hull , continued to doubt the extent of German and Italian operations , despite evidence to the contrary . In 1938 , as the tide has turned against the Loyalists , Roosevelt tried , unsuccessfully , to bypass the embargo and ship American aircraft to the Republic via France .
