Her paternal grandfather , Antonio Cansino , was renowned as a classical Spanish dancer . He popularized the bolero , and his dancing school in Madrid was world - famous . Hayworth later recalled , `` From the time I was three and a half ... as soon as I could stand on my own feet , I was given dance lessons . '' She noted `` I did n't like it very much ... but I did n't have the courage to tell my father , so I began taking the lessons . Rehearse , rehearse , rehearse , that was my girlhood '' .
