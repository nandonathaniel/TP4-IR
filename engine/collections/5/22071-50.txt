In June 2013 , Rick Moranis gave a rare interview where he talked about appearing in the third film and his disappointment with the sequel . Moranis said `` I have n't talked to Dan Aykroyd about it . Somebody he 's associated with called me and I said , ' I would n't not do it , but it 's got to be good . ' You know , I 'm not interested in doing anything I 've already done , and I thought the second one was a disappointment . But I guess I 'm interested in where that guy is now . I sort of see him as being Bernie Madoff 's cellmate in jail . Both of them being so orderly that they race to get up and make their beds . '' In October 2013 , Dan Aykroyd appeared on Australian talk show The Project and confirmed that the script for the third film is currently being rewritten . He stated that they would be bringing in a younger generation of Ghostbusters along with the original Ghostbusters ( excluding Bill Murray ) for the third film . Aykroyd went on to state that they would not be writing Murray 's character out , nor would they be recasting the role . Aykroyd also stated that `` the door is always open if Bill wanted to return to the role . ''
