In most cases and particularly with reference to Western economies , a mixed economy refers to a capitalist economy characterized by the predominance of private ownership of the means of production with profit - seeking enterprise and the accumulation of capital as its fundamental driving force . In this system , markets are subject to varying degrees of regulatory control and governments wield indirect macroeconomic influence through fiscal and monetary policies designed to counteract capitalism 's history of boom / bust cycles , unemployment and income disparities . In this framework , varying degrees of public utilities and essential services are under public ownership and state activity is often limited to providing public goods and universal civic requirements like healthcare , physical infrastructure and management of public lands .
