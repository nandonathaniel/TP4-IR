By 1974 , approximately 2.5 million women had received the Dalkon intrauterine device . In June of that year , the Medical Director of A.H. Robins published a letter to the editor of the British Medical Journal stating that the company was aware of an `` apparent increase in the number of cases of septic abortions '' including 4 fatalities , but stating that `` there is no evidence of a direct cause - and - effect relationship between wearing of the Dalkon Shield and the occurrence of septicemia '' . The letter recommended precautions including pregnancy tests for women who missed their period and immediate removal of the device in women who were found to be pregnant . In October 1974 , a series of four case reports of septic pregnancies was published in the journal Obstretics and Gynecology `` . In 1975 , the CDC published a study associating the Dalkon Shield with a higher risk of spontaneous abortion - related death compared to other IUDs .
