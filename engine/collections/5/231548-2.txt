Legal segregation of schools was stopped in the U.S. by federal enforcement of a series of Supreme Court decisions after Brown v. Board of Education in 1954 . All legally enforced public segregation was abolished by the Civil Rights Act of 1964 . It passed after demonstrations during the Civil Rights Movement resulted in public opinion turning against enforced segregation . De facto segregation -- segregation `` in fact '' , without sanction of law -- persists in varying degrees to the present day . The contemporary racial segregation seen in the United States in residential neighborhoods has been shaped by public policies , mortgage discrimination , and redlining , among other factors . Hypersegregation is a form of racial segregation that consists of the geographical grouping of racial groups . Most often , this occurs in cities where the residents of the inner city are African Americans and the suburbs surrounding this inner core are often European American residents . The idea of hypersegregation gained credibility in 1989 due to the work of Douglas Massey and Nancy A. Denton and their studies of `` American Apartheid '' , when whites created black ghettos during the first half of the 20th century in order to isolate growing urban black populations .
