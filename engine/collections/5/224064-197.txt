The Qur'an speaks extensively about the Children of Israel ( Banû Isrâ'îl ) and recognizes that the Jews ( al - Yahûd ) are , according to lineage , descendants of Prophet Abraham through his son Isaac and grandson Jacob . They were chosen by Allah for a mission : `` And We chose them , purposely , above ( all ) creatures . '' ( Sûrah al - Dukhân : 32 ) Allah raised among them many Prophets and bestowed upon them what He had not bestowed upon many others : `` And ( remember ) when Musa said unto his people : O my people ! Remember Allah 's favor unto you , how He placed among you Prophets , and He made you Kings , and gave you that ( which ) He gave not to any ( other ) of ( His ) creatures . '' ( Sûrah al - Mâ'idah : 20 ) He , also , exalted them over other nations of the earth and granted them many favors : `` O Children of Israel ! Remember My favor wherewith I favored you and how I preferred you to ( all ) creatures . '' ( Sûrah al - Baqarah : 47 ) They were chosen by God for a mission ( 44 : 32 ) and God raised among them many Prophets and bestowed upon them what He had not bestowed upon many others ( 5 : 20 ) .
