For a re-run of American Top 40 , some stations , such as WOGL in Philadelphia , replaced the song with an optional extra when it aired a rerun of a November 18 , 1972 broadcast of AT40 ( where it ranked at # 14 ) on December 6 , 2008 . Among other stations , most Clear Channel - owned radio stations to whom the AT40 ' 70s rebroadcasts were contracted did not air the rebroadcast that same weekend , although it was because they were playing Christmas music and not because of the controversy . Even back in 1972 , some stations would refuse to play the song on AT40 , even when it reached number one .
