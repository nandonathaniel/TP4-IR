In the 1890s the major world powers ( France , Britain , Germany , Japan , and Russia ) began carving out spheres of influence for themselves in China , which was then under the Qing dynasty . The United States demanded this practice to end so that all nations could trade on an equal footing . In 1899 , U.S. Secretary of State John Hay sent diplomatic letters to these nations , asking them to guarantee the territorial and administrative integrity of China and to not interfere with the free use of treaty ports within their respective spheres of influence . The major powers evaded commitment , saying they could not agree to anything until the other powers had consented first . Hay took this as acceptance of his proposal , which came to be known as the Open Door Policy .
