On 29 November 1947 , the United Nations General Assembly , voting 33 to 13 in favour with 10 abstentions , adopted a resolution , Resolution 181 ( II ) , recommended a partition with Economic Union of Mandatory Palestine to follow the termination of the British Mandate . The plan was to partition Palestine into an `` Independent Arab state alongside a Jewish States , and the Special International Regime for the City of Jerusalem '' . Jerusalem was to encompass Bethlehem . Zionist leaders ( including the Jewish Agency ) , accepted the plan , while Palestinian Arab leaders rejected it and all independent Muslim and Arab states voted against it . Almost immediately , sectarian violence erupted and spread , killing hundreds of Arabs , Jews and British over the ensuing months .
