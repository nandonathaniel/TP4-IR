Philosophical support for democratic socialism can be found in the works of political philosophers like Charles Taylor and Axel Honneth , among others . Honneth has put forward the view that political and economic ideologies have a social basis , that is they originate from intersubjective communication between members of a society . Honneth criticises the liberal state because it assumes that principles of individual liberty and private property are ahistorical and abstract , when in fact they evolved from a specific social discourse on human activity . Contra liberal individualism , Honneth has emphasised the inter-subjective dependence between humans , that is our well - being depends on recognising others and being recognised by them . Democratic socialism with an emphasis on community and solidarity can be seen as a way of safeguarding this dependency .
