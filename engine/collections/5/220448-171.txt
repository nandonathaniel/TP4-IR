The archaeologist Elena Efimovna Kuzmina enlists clear parallels between the burial practices of the ancient Asiatic steppe Andronovo cultures ( fl. 1800 -- 1400 BCE ) and the Vedic Age . In Kuzmina 's archaeological definition , sati is understood as a double burial , the co-cremation of a man and a woman / wife , a feature to be found in both cultures . Kuz πmina states that in the Androvo culture and Vedic age , the practice was never strictly observed and was symbolic .
