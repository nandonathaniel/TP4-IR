Historically , the SAT was more widely used by students living in coastal states and the ACT was more widely used by students in the Midwest and South ; in recent years , however , an increasing number of students on the East and West coasts have been taking the ACT . Since 2007 , all four - year colleges and universities in the United States that require a test as part of an application for admission will accept either the SAT or ACT , and over 950 four - year colleges and universities do not require any standardized test scores at all for admission .
