Meanwhile , on the western side of Leyte , the XXIV Corps received reinforcements on 7 December with the landing of the 77th Infantry Division under Maj. Gen. Andrew D. Bruce south of Ormoc City . The 77th Division 's 305th and 307th Infantry Regiments came ashore at 0700 unopposed , supported by a company from the 776th Amphibian Tank Battalion . However , Admiral Arthur D. Struble 's naval convoy was subjected to kamikaze air attacks , fifty - five aircraft making sixteen raids . Yet , the arrival of the 77th Division proved decisive . This enabled the 7th Division to resume its march north , and the enemy defenders were quickly squeezed between the two forces .
