As the World 's Columbian Exposition was set to celebrate the 400th anniversary the arrival of Christopher Columbus in the Americas , Upham sought to link the publication 's flag drive to the event , `` so that every school in the land ... would have a flag raising , under the most impressive conditions . '' Bellamy was placed in charge of this operation and was soon lobbying `` not only the superintendents of education in all the States , but ( he ) also worked with governors , Congressmen , and even the President of the United States . '' The publication 's efforts paid off when Benjamin Harrison declared Wednesday October 12 , 1892 , to be Columbus Day for which The Youth 's Companion made `` an official program for universal use in all the schools . '' Bellamy recalled that the event `` had to be more than a list of exercises . The ritual must be prepared with simplicity and dignity . ''
