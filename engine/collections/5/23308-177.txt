Webster is the castle 's scribe who was transformed into a dictionary by the Enchantress ' spell . While he means well , he has a rather long tongue , often speaking out of the right moment . This leads to the other servants , particularly Lumiere and Cogsworth , to dislike him greatly . During the first segment of Belle 's Magical World , he infuriates the Beast by giving unwanted synonyms to Belle 's insults during a row leading the Beast to strike him . Wracked with guilt after Belle and the Beast stop speaking to each other , he forges a letter of apology from Belle with his two best friends Crane and LePlume . He is exiled from the castle when the Beast finds out , but amends are made after Belle brings him back .
