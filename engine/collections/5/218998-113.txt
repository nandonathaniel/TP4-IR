A repeater with multiple ports is known as an Ethernet hub . Repeaters work on the physical layer of the OSI model . Repeaters require a small amount of time to regenerate the signal . This can cause a propagation delay that affects network performance and may affect proper function . As a result , many network architectures limit the number of repeaters that can be used in a row , e.g. , the Ethernet 5 - 4 - 3 rule .
