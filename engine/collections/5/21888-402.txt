Some schools have a similar format but ordered as 4 - 4 - 1 , with the short term in May after the conclusion of the spring semester . The term is sometimes called either `` Maymester '' , a portmanteau of `` May '' and `` semester '' , or `` May Term '' . Examples of schools using this system include Wartburg College , Bates College , Chatham University , Clemson University , The College of New Jersey , Elmira College , The Ohio State University , Purdue University , Transylvania University , the University of Redlands , Emory University and Washington and Lee University 's 12 - 12 - 4 undergraduate calendar .
