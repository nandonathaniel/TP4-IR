Later , during the Han Dynasty , these tables were used by prominent families to glorify themselves and sometimes even to legitimize their political power . For example , Cao Pi , who forced the abdication of the last Han emperor in his favor , claimed descent from the Yellow Emperor . Chinese emperors sometimes passed their own surnames to subjects as honors . Unlike European practice in which some surnames are obviously noble , Chinese emperors and members of the royal family had regular surnames except in cases where they came from non-Han ethnic groups . This was a result of Chinese imperial theory in which a commoner could receive the Mandate of Heaven and become emperor . Upon becoming emperor , the emperor would retain his original surname . Also as a consequence , many people also had the same surname as the emperor , but had no direct relation to the royal family .
