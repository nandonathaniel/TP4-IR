Evidence of the second phase is no longer visible . The number of postholes dating to the early 3rd millennium BC suggest that some form of timber structure was built within the enclosure during this period . Further standing timbers were placed at the northeast entrance , and a parallel alignment of posts ran inwards from the southern entrance . The postholes are smaller than the Aubrey Holes , being only around 0.4 metres ( 16 in ) in diameter , and are much less regularly spaced . The bank was purposely reduced in height and the ditch continued to silt up . At least twenty - five of the Aubrey Holes are known to have contained later , intrusive , cremation burials dating to the two centuries after the monument 's inception . It seems that whatever the holes ' initial function , it changed to become a funerary one during Phase 2 . Thirty further cremations were placed in the enclosure 's ditch and at other points within the monument , mostly in the eastern half . Stonehenge is therefore interpreted as functioning as an enclosed cremation cemetery at this time , the earliest known cremation cemetery in the British Isles . Fragments of unburnt human bone have also been found in the ditch - fill . Dating evidence is provided by the late Neolithic grooved ware pottery that has been found in connection with the features from this phase .
