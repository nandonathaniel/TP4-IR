The show did not shy away from commenting on issues of the day . A sketch in the second series , in which a Conservative government minister is strangled while Stephen Fry screams at him `` What are you doing to the television system ? What are you doing to the country ? '' , is an attack on the Broadcasting Act of 1990 and the perceived motivations of those who supported it . The pair would later attack what they saw as the Act 's malign aftereffects in the sketch `` It 's a Soaraway Life '' , a parody of It 's a Wonderful Life evoking a world in which Rupert Murdoch had not existed .
