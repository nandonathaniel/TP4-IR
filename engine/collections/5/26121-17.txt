In addition to the use of the multiprotein complexes listed above , Gram - negative bacteria possess another method for release of material : the formation of outer membrane vesicles . Portions of the outer membrane pinch off , forming spherical structures made of a lipid bilayer enclosing periplasmic materials . Vesicles from a number of bacterial species have been found to contain virulence factors , some have immunomodulatory effects , and some can directly adhere to and intoxicate host cells . While release of vesicles has been demonstrated as a general response to stress conditions , the process of loading cargo proteins seems to be selective .
