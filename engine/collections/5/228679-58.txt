When Auschwitz was liberated on 26 and 27 January by the 322nd Rifle Division of the Red Army , the soldiers found 7,500 prisoners alive and over 600 corpses . Among items found by the Soviet soldiers were 370,000 men 's suits , 837,000 women 's garments , and 7.7 tonnes ( 8.5 short tons ) of human hair . The camp 's liberation received little press attention at the time . In historian Laurence Rees ' opinion , this was due to three factors : the previous discovery of similar crimes at Majdanek concentration camp , competing news from the Allied summit at Yalta , and the Soviet Union 's interest , for propaganda purposes , in minimizing attention to Jewish suffering . Due to the vast extent of the camp area , at least four divisions took part in liberating the camp : 100th Rifle Division ( established in Vologda , Russia ) , 322nd Rifle Division ( Gorky , Russia ) , 286th Rifle Division ( Leningrad ) , and 107th Motor Rifle Division ( Tambov , Russia ) .
