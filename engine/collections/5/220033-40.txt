In September 2005 , in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina , Google Maps quickly updated its satellite imagery of New Orleans to allow users to view the extent of the flooding in various parts of that city . ( Oddly , in March 2007 , imagery showing hurricane damage was replaced with images from before the storm ; this replacement was not made on Google Earth , which still uses post-Katrina imagery . )
