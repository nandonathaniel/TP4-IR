There are also a number of RNA - dependent RNA polymerases that use RNA as their template for synthesis of a new strand of RNA . For instance , a number of RNA viruses ( such as poliovirus ) use this type of enzyme to replicate their genetic material . Also , RNA - dependent RNA polymerase is part of the RNA interference pathway in many organisms .
