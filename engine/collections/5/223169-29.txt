The interrogation scene between Batman and the Joker was the first scene shot with Ledger really showing the full performance all together . The director and his leading actors all liked the idea of shooting the key scene early on . During rehearsals , the actors kept things loose and improvisational , saving for the actual shoot . Bale confirmed that Ledger did not perform the Joker 's voice during rehearsals , waiting to get in character when the cameras rolled . Nolan later acknowledged the scene to be his favorite in the film , saying `` I had never seen anybody sell a punch the way Heath was able to do with Christian . ''
