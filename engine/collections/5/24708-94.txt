Some 19th - century French painters had a low opinion of black : `` Reject black , '' Paul Gauguin said , `` and that mix of black and white they call gray . Nothing is black , nothing is gray . '' But Ã‰douard Manet used blacks for their strength and dramatic effect . Manet 's portrait of painter Berthe Morisot was a study in black which perfectly captured her spirit of independence . The black gave the painting power and immediacy ; he even changed her eyes , which were green , to black to strengthen the effect . Henri Matisse quoted the French impressionist Pissarro telling him , `` Manet is stronger than us all -- he made light with black . ''
