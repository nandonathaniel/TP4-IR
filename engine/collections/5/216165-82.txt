In 1625 , in the Battle of San Juan , the Dutch commander Boudewijn Hendricksz tested the defenses ' limits like no one else before . Learning from Francis Drake 's previous failures here , he circumvented the cannons of the castle of San Felipe del Morro and quickly brought his 17 ships into the San Juan Bay . He then occupied the port and attacked the city while the population hurried for shelter behind the Morro 's moat and high battlements . Historians consider this event the worst attack on San Juan . Though the Dutch set the village on fire , they failed to conquer the Morro , and its batteries pounded their troops and ships until Hendricksz deemed the cause lost . Hendricksz 's expedition eventually helped propel a fortification frenzy . Constructions of defenses for the San Crist√≥bal Hill were soon ordered so as to prevent the landing of invaders out of reach of the Morro 's artillery . Urban planning responded to the needs of keeping the colony in Spanish hands .
