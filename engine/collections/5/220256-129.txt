A series of Royalist uprisings throughout England and a Scottish invasion occurred in the summer of 1648 . Forces loyal to Parliament put down most of the uprisings in England after little more than skirmishes , but uprisings in Kent , Essex and Cumberland , the rebellion in Wales , and the Scottish invasion involved the fighting of pitched battles and prolonged sieges .
