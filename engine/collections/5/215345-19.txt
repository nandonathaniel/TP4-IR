This leads to Trevor vowing to kill Michael , but needing him alive for one last heist . When that heist is successful , Trevor is so pleased that he lifts the death vow but still hates Michael . Near the end of the game , Franklin is given a choice : kill Trevor , kill Michael , or let them live and face their enemies .

Trevor once again considers Michael his friend , albeit a friend that he hates , which Michael accepts . If the second option is chosen , Trevor ends all contact with Franklin and says to stay away from him after finding out about Michael 's death . If the first option is chosen , Franklin meets up with Trevor , before chasing him with Michael to an oil plant . When Trevor crashes into an oil tank , causing himself to be covered in oil , either Franklin or Michael shoot the oil , setting Trevor alight and killing him . If Trevor and Michael are spared , they continue to spend time together with Franklin , during which Trevor eventually admits that he over-reacted after learning the truth about Brad , and refers to himself and Michael as friends .
