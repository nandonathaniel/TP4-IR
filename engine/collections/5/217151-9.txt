Over the centuries a wide range of theological interpretations for the term Kingdom of God have appeared . For instance , in Catholic teachings , the official declaration Dominus Iesus ( item 5 ) states that the kingdom of God can not be detached either from Christ or from the Church , for `` if the kingdom is separated from Jesus , it is no longer the kingdom of God which he revealed . '' Eastern Orthodox Christians believe that the Kingdom of God is present within the Church and is communicated to believers as it interacts with them .
