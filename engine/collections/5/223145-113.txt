Light reactive imaging BCI devices are still in the realm of theory . These would involve implanting a laser inside the skull . The laser would be trained on a single neuron and the neuron 's reflectance measured by a separate sensor . When the neuron fires , the laser light pattern and wavelengths it reflects would change slightly . This would allow researchers to monitor single neurons but require less contact with tissue and reduce the risk of scar - tissue build - up .
