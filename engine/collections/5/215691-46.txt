The Sultanate of Brunei declared independence from Majapahit following the death of Majapahit Emperor in mid-14th century . During its golden age under Bolkiah from the 15th century to the 17th century , the Bruneian Empire ruled almost entire coastal area of Borneo ( lending its name to the island due to its influence in the region ) and several islands in the Philippines . During the 1450s , Shari'ful Hashem Syed Abu Bakr , an Arab born in Johor , arrived in Sulu from Malacca . In 1457 , he founded the Sultanate of Sulu ; he titled himself as `` Paduka Maulana Mahasari Sharif Sultan Hashem Abu Bakr '' . Following their independence in 1578 from Brunei 's influence , the Sulu 's began to expand their thalassocracy to parts of the northern Borneo . Both the sultanates who ruled northern Borneo had traditionally engaged in trade with China by means of the frequently - arriving Chinese junks . Despite the thalassocracy of the sultanates , Borneo 's interior region remained free from the rule of any kingdoms .
