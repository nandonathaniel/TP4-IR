Princes Bridge was originally separated from Flinders Street , even though it was only on the opposite side of Swanston Street . Once the railway line was extended under the street in 1865 to join the two , Princes Bridge was closed . It was not reopened until April 1879 , and from 1909 slowly became amalgamated into Flinders Street . Federation Square now occupies its site . Up until the 1880s a number of designs for a new station had been prepared , but none ever went any further .
