An emerging field in the study of resilience is the neurobiological basis of resilience to stress . For example , neuropeptide Y ( NPY ) and 5 - Dehydroepiandrosterone ( 5 - DHEA ) are thought to limit the stress response by reducing sympathetic nervous system activation and protecting the brain from the potentially harmful effects of chronically elevated cortisol levels respectively . In addition , the relationship between social support and stress resilience is thought to be mediated by the oxytocin system 's impact on the hypothalamic - pituitary - adrenal axis . `` Resilience , conceptualized as a positive bio-psychological adaptation , has proven to be a useful theoretical context for understanding variables for predicting long - term health and well - being '' .
