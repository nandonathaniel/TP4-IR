American post-war military assistance programs loaned the RAF enough Superfortresses to equip several RAF Bomber Command squadrons . The aircraft were known as the Washington B. 1 in RAF service , and served from March 1950 until the last bombers were returned in early 1954 . The phase out had been occasioned by deliveries of the English Electric Canberra bombers . Three Washingtons modified for ELINT duties and a standard bomber version used for support by No. 192 Squadron RAF were decommissioned in 1958 , being replaced by de Havilland Comet aircraft .
