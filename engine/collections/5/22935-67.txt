Prior to the establishment of the Empire , the territories of the Roman Republic had been divided in 43 BC among the members of the Second Triumvirate : Mark Antony , Octavian and Marcus Aemilius Lepidus . Antony received the provinces in the East : Achaea , Macedonia and Epirus ( roughly modern Greece , Albania and the coast of Croatia ) , Bithynia , Pontus and Asia ( roughly modern Turkey ) , Syria , Cyprus , and Cyrenaica . These lands had previously been conquered by Alexander the Great ; thus , much of the aristocracy was of Greek origin . The whole region , especially the major cities , had been largely assimilated into Greek culture , Greek often serving as the lingua franca .
