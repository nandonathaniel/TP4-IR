His political development was strongly influenced by his legal training and practice , in particular his hope to achieve change not through violence but through `` legal revolution '' . Over the course of his life , he began by advocating a path of non-violence , later embracing violence , and then adopting a non-violent approach to negotiation and reconciliation . When endorsing violence , he did so because he saw no alternative , and was always pragmatic about it , perceiving it as a means to get his opponent to the negotiating table . He sought to target symbols of white supremacy and racist oppression rather than white people as individuals , and was anxious not to inaugurate a race war in South Africa . This willingness to use violence distinguishes Mandela from the ideology of Gandhism , with which some commentators have sought to associate him .
