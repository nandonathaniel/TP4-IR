Hydrogen peroxide can be used for the sterilization of various surfaces , including surgical tools and may be deployed as a vapour ( VHP ) for room sterilization . H O demonstrates broad - spectrum efficacy against viruses , bacteria , yeasts , and bacterial spores . In general , greater activity is seen against Gram - positive than Gram - negative bacteria ; however , the presence of catalase or other peroxidases in these organisms can increase tolerance in the presence of lower concentrations . Higher concentrations of H O ( 10 to 30 % ) and longer contact times are required for sporicidal activity .
