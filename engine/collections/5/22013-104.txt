The President of the Senate also presides over counting and presentation of the votes of the Electoral College . This process occurs in the presence of both houses of Congress , generally on January 6 of the year following a U.S. presidential election . In this capacity , only four vice presidents have been able to announce their own election to the presidency : John Adams , Thomas Jefferson , Martin Van Buren , and George H.W. Bush . At the beginning of 1961 , it fell to Richard Nixon to preside over this process , which officially announced the election of his 1960 opponent , John F. Kennedy . In 2001 , Al Gore announced the election of his opponent , George W. Bush . In 1969 , Vice President Hubert Humphrey would have announced the election of his opponent , Richard Nixon ; however , on the date of the Congressional joint session ( January 6 ) , Humphrey was in Norway attending the funeral of Trygve Lie , the first elected Secretary - General of the United Nations . The president pro tempore presided in Humphrey 's absence .
