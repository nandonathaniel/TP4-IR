Two independent studies published in the New England Journal of Medicine in January 2007 , implicated pergolide , along with cabergoline , in causing valvular heart disease . As a result of this , the FDA removed pergolide from the United States market in March 2007 . ( Since cabergoline is not approved in the United States for Parkinson 's Disease , but for hyperprolactinemia , the drug remains on the market . Treatment for hyperprolactinemia requires lower doses than that for Parkinson 's Disease , diminishing the risk of valvular heart disease ) .
