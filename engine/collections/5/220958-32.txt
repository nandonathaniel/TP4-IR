Morticia Addams ( Carolyn Jones ) -- A cultivated and beautiful woman who knits , dabbles in art , plays the shamisen , raises carnivorous plants and trims roses by clipping off the buds and arranging the thorny stems in a vase . With long , straight ebony - black hair , she is always attired in a long , floor - length tight black dress , and with her aristocratic bearing and detachment , she is often the calm center of the chaotic events of the household .
