The A-League has two trophies which are competed for during the season : the Premier 's Plate and the A-League Trophy . The Premier 's Plate is awarded to the A-League Premiers , the regular season winners , and the A-League Trophy is awarded to the A-League Champions , the winner of the Grand Final . Both pieces of silverware were designed by Sydney design company D3 Design . The A-League Trophy is nicknamed the `` Toilet Seat '' due to its shape . Where as the Premier 's Plate follows a traditional trophy design , the A-League Trophy differs . In 2005 , John O'Neill , FFA CEO commented during the unveiling of the A-League Trophy , `` We have a new national league and we feel it is important to re-define the conventional view of a trophy to reflect this '' . Clive Solari of D3 Design explained the trophy 's design , saying `` We wanted our trophy concept to embody the historical significance of sport in a contemporary design . So we looked to history to see how great achievements have been rewarded across all types of games for thousands of years . The winners of the world 's original sporting competition , the Olympic Games , were presented with a laurel wreath on their heads . We used this model as a basis for a unique , cutting - edge design -- our trophy is a modern and versatile translation of the wreath . The winners can hold it above their heads as a symbol of success '' .
