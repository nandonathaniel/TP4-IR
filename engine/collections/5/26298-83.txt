All of Stefan Hutchinson 's Halloween comic books take place in the Halloween H20 timeline , which retconned Halloween 4 -- 6 from continuity . Hutchinson comments that , while the retcon was unpopular with `` a lot of fans '' for ignoring previous movies , he preferred the `` simplicity of this storyline , over the needlessly convoluted mythology that the last three films had created '' . However , he admits that one of the downsides of the H20 timeline is that fans do not know exactly what happened to Dr. Sam Loomis after Halloween II . To remedy this , Hutchinson pitched Halloween : Sam as a way of paying tribute to the character . Written by Hutchinson and featuring illustrations from Autopsis ' Marcus Smith , Sam is a prose short story available exclusively for download at the website HalloweenComics.com . It explores the life of Dr. Loomis , including his backstory and relationship with Elizabeth Worthington , a journalist he met during World War II . In 1995 , Michael Myers visits the ailing Dr. Loomis in a hospital and murders Elizabeth in front of him . Loomis attempts to stop him , but dies of a coronary failure .
