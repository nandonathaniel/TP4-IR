The film begins with various shots of the audience chanting `` Dusty ! '' , which is repeated throughout . Meanwhile , the band begins , as the smoke and the lights are turned on , we see Wyatt `` Dusty '' Chandler ( George Strait ) entering the stage , and performing `` Heartland '' , `` Baby Your Baby '' , and a shortened version of `` Where the Sidewalk Ends '' . Dusty feels that his elaborate stage show is overwhelming his music , a suspicion confirmed one night when he purposely forgets several bars of a chart - topping hit and his fans do n't even notice . Disillusioned , Dusty walks off after the concert without telling his manager , Lula ( Lesley Ann Warren ) . The only person he tells is his best friend and drummer , Earl ( John Doe ) , and that he is `` taking a walk , '' but does not say exactly where he is going or for how long . Dusty is singing a blurry version of `` Where the Sidewalk Ends '' . In a down home bar , we see Al ( Mark Walters ) . Dusty had breakfast with the Tucker family during this scene .
