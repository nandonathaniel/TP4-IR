It should also be noted that business and economic competition in most countries is often limited or restricted . Competition often is subject to legal restrictions . For example , competition may be legally prohibited as in the case with a government monopoly or a government - granted monopoly . Tariffs or other protectionist measures may also be instituted by government in order to prevent or reduce competition . Depending on the respective economic policy , the pure competition is to a greater or lesser extent regulated by competition policy and competition law . Competition between countries is quite subtle to detect , but is quite evident in the World economy , where countries the US , Japan , the constituents of the European Union , China and the Asian Tigers each try to outdo the other in the quest for economic supremacy in the global market , harkening to the concept of Kiasuism . Such competition is evident by the policies undertaken by these countries to educate the future workforce . For example , East Asian economies like Singapore , Japan , and South Korea tend to emphasize education by allocating a large portion of the budget to this sector , and by implementing programmes such as gifted , which some detractors criticize as indicative of elitism .
