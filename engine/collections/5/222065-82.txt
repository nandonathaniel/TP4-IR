After the first commercial break , Brown typically asks Kevin Brauch to introduce the judges . Generally , Kevin pays homage to the program 's origins by adding , Konban Wa ( Japanese for `` Good evening '' ) to his introduction . Unlike the original series , none of the judges participate in the running commentary , although Brown or Brauch visit with them roughly mid-battle for their comments on the ongoing action and the secret ingredient . Over the course of the cooking hour , Brown may also provide further information on the theme ingredient , using visual aids as required .
