In a case study of the Los Angeles Basin , simulations showed that even when trees are not strategically placed in these urban heat islands , they can still aid in minimization of pollutants and energy reduction . It is estimated that with this wide - scale implementation , the city of Los Angeles can annually save $100 M with most of the savings coming from cool roofs , lighter colored pavement , and the planting of trees . With a citywide implementation , added benefits from the lowering smog - level would result in at least one billion dollars of saving per year .
