For a player to accomplish this , he would have to average 30 complete games over 25 seasons to get to 750 . Between 2000 and 2009 , the Major League leaders in complete games averaged 8 per season , and only two pitchers in the 21st century have had 10 complete games in any season ( CC Sabathia with 10 in 2008 and James Shields with 11 in 2011 ) . In addition , only two pitchers other than Young have even started as many as 749 games -- Nolan Ryan ( 773 ) and Don Sutton ( 756 ) . The closest active player is Sabathia with 38 complete games .
