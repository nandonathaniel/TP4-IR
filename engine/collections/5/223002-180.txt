There have been several notable power outages in Auckland . The five - week - long 1998 Auckland power crisis blacked out much of the CBD after a cascade failure occurred on four underground cables in Mercury Energy 's sub-transmission network . The 2006 Auckland Blackout interrupted supply to the CBD and many inner suburbs after an earth wire shackle at Transpower 's Otahuhu substation broke and short - circuited the lines supplying the inner city . In 2009 , much of the northern and western suburbs , as well as all of Northland , experienced a blackout when a forklift accidentally came into contact with the Otahuhu to Henderson 220 kV line , the only major line supplying the region . Transpower spent $1.25 billion in the early 2010s reinforcing the supply into and across Auckland , including a 400 kV - capable transmission line from the Waikato River to Brownhill substation ( operated at 220 kV initially ) , and 220 kV underground cables between Brownhill and Pakuranga , and between Pakuranga and Albany via the CBD . These reduced the Auckland Region 's reliance on Otahuhu substation and northern and western Auckland 's reliance on the Otahuhu to Henderson line .
