Land warfare changed from the static front lines of World War I to increased mobility and combined arms . The tank , which had been used predominantly for infantry support in the First World War , had evolved into the primary weapon . In the late 1930s , tank design was considerably more advanced than it had been during World War I , and advances continued throughout the war with increases in speed , armour and firepower .
