I believe in an America that is officially neither Catholic , Protestant nor Jewish -- where no public official either requests or accepts instructions on public policy from the Pope , the National Council of Churches or any other ecclesiastical source -- where no religious body seeks to impose its will directly or indirectly upon the general populace or the public acts of its officials -- and where religious liberty is so indivisible that an act against one church is treated as an act against all .
