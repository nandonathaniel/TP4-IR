Vocal Abilities -- Superman has shown possession of various vocal abilities . Stories have shown him being capable of raising his voice to loudspeaker levels , for purposes such as delivering a message to a large crowd . Early Golden Age stories showed Superman capable of mimicking the voice of others and throwing his voice through simple ventriloquism . By the 1950s , the said ability had evolved into a stand - alone power called `` super-ventriloquism , '' the ability of Superman to send his voice across vast distances , but only to a specific person or place . Super-ventriloquism was used in both Silver Age and Bronze Age stories , but it was generally discarded in post-Crisis stories .
