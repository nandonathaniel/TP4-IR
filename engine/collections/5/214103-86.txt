Trujillo and colleagues have placed upper limits in Sedna 's surface composition of 60 % for methane ice and 70 % for water ice . The presence of methane further supports the existence of tholins on Sedna 's surface , because they are produced by irradiation of methane . Barucci and colleagues compared Sedna 's spectrum with that of Triton and detected weak absorption bands belonging to methane and nitrogen ices . From these observations , they suggested the following model of the surface : 24 % Triton - type tholins , 7 % amorphous carbon , 10 % nitrogen , 26 % methanol , and 33 % methane . The detection of methane and water ices was confirmed in 2006 by the Spitzer Space Telescope mid-infrared photometry . The presence of nitrogen on the surface suggests the possibility that , at least for a short time , Sedna may have a tenuous atmosphere . During a 200 - year period near perihelion , the maximum temperature on Sedna should exceed 35.6 K ( − 237.6 ° C ) , the transition temperature between alpha - phase solid N and the beta phase seen on Triton . At 38 K , the N vapor pressure would be 14 microbar ( 1.4 Pa or 0.000014 atm ) . However , its deep red spectral slope is indicative of high concentrations of organic material on its surface , and its weak methane absorption bands indicate that methane on Sedna 's surface is ancient , rather than freshly deposited . This means that Sedna is too cold for methane to evaporate from its surface and then fall back as snow , which happens on Triton and probably on Pluto .
