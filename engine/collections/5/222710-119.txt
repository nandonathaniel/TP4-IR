-- when the expectation is taken over the probability distribution of σ given S , as it is in the Bayesian case , rather than S given σ , one can no longer take σ as a constant and factor it out . The consequence of this is that , compared to the sampling - theory calculation , the Bayesian calculation puts more weight on larger values of σ , properly taking into account ( as the sampling - theory calculation can not ) that under this squared - loss function the consequence of underestimating large values of σ is more costly in squared - loss terms than that of overestimating small values of σ .
