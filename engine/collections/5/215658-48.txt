`` I 've Gotta Get a Message to You '' has appeared in five versions all made from the same recording , but heard at three different speeds , faded out at three different points , and with different elements mixed forward . As to the speed , Bill Inglot said in 1999 that the mix he made for the Tales from the Brothers Gibb box in 1990 is at the correct reel tape speed . This speed is intermediate between the mono and stereo mixes released in 1968 . The correct speed can be achieved by playing the mono single mix at 98.8 % and the LP stereo mix at 103.0 % , which brings them to the correct timing .
