Most RISC architectures have fixed - length instructions ( commonly 32 bits ) and a simple encoding , which simplifies fetch , decode , and issue logic considerably . One drawback of 32 - bit instructions is reduced code density , which is more adverse a characteristic in embedded computing than it is in the workstation and server markets RISC architectures were originally designed to serve . To address this problem , several architectures , such as ARM , Power ISA , MIPS , RISC - V , and the Adapteva Epiphany , have an optional short feature - reduced instruction format or instruction compression feature . The SH5 also follows this pattern , albeit having evolved in the opposite direction , having added longer media instructions to an original 16 - bit encoding .
