As U.S. troop strength in South Vietnam increased , more young men were drafted for service there , and many of those still at home sought means of avoiding the draft . Since only 15,000 National Guard and Reserve soldiers were sent to South Vietnam , enlistment in the Guard or the Reserves became a popular means of avoiding serving in a war zone . For those who could meet the more stringent enlistment standards , service in the Air Force , Navy , or Coast Guard was a means of reducing the chances of being killed . Vocations to the ministry and the rabbinate soared , because divinity students were exempt from the draft . Doctors and draft board members found themselves being pressured by relatives or family friends to exempt potential draftees .
