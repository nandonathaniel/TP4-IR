Galand ( ガラン , Garan ) Voiced by : Hiroshi Iwasaki A tall , lanky , prideful , and bloodthirsty demon fully clad in armor that wields a weapon resembling a spear . He chose to attack Camelot as a warm - up when he was told about the destruction of the Albion golems . Even with his powers depleted , he 's still strong enough to nearly erase a city with a swing of his spear . He represents the Truth in the Ten Commandments , and anyone who lies in his presence will turn into stone regardless of his / her power . He turned Merlin into stone when she tried to win time , killed most of the Camelot soldiers , and handily defeated Meliodas , Diane and Slader , leaving them for dead . Fortunately , Gowther modified his memories before he could finish them off . When Meliodas regained his full powers and was teleported by Merlin , he defeated Galand in less than ten seconds and left him a bloody mess . He later accompanies Melascula and both end up fighting Ban , who ends up putting up a significant fight against the duo when he saps their strength before he is forced to retreat . When the Demons follow Ban , Jericho and Elaine in order to finish them , they stumble into Escanor 's bar in a cave . Galand showed his love for alcohol and challenged Escanor to a `` game '' in which the two would take turns hitting each other with their weapons until one was dead . Despite being split in half by the Sin of Pride , he regenerated and used his most powerful ability `` Critical Over '' to finish him , only to see that his attack barely scratched him . When Melascula tried to convince him to retreat , his pride made him continue and when Escanor was about to finish him , he tried to flee , only to be turned to stone by his own power , since he went back on his word . While he is turned to stone , he is still alive He is eventually killed by Estarossa , who shatters him in order to collect his Commandment .
