The Republic of Ireland was a latecomer to television , Telefís Éireann being established in 1962 . Although early news broadcasts were recorded on kinescopes , almost all broadcasts from the first fifteen years ( i.e. up to 1977 ) are lost . Of the soap opera Tolka Row ( 1964 -- 68 ) only the last episode survives , while almost all the early episodes of The Late Late Show ( 1962 -- present ) are lost . Even when shows were sent abroad -- The Riordans was sent to Australia for rebroadcast -- the tapes were often sent back to Ireland and recorded over , as they were so expensive .
