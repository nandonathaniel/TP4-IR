In reply to the ALCA , Chavez initiated the Bolivarian Alliance for the Americas ( ALBA ) . Venezuela , Cuba and Bolivia signed the TCP ( or People 's Trade Agreement ) , while Venezuela , a main productor of natural gas and of petroleum ( it is member of the OPEC ) has signed treaties with Nicaragua , where Daniel Ortega , former leader of the Sandinistas , was elected in 2006 -- Ortega , however , cut down his anti-imperialist and socialist discourse , and is hotly controversial ; both on the right - wing and on the left - wing . Chávez also implemented the Petrocaribe alliance , signed by 12 of the 15 members of the Caribbean Community in 2005 . When Hurricane Katrina ravaged Florida and Louisiana , Chávez , who called the `` Yanqui Empire '' a `` paper tiger '' , even ironically proposed to provide `` oil - for - the - poor '' to the US after Hurricane Katrina the same year , through Citgo , a subsidiary of PDVSA the state - owned Venezuelan petroleum company , which has 14,000 gas stations and owns eight oil refineries in the US .
