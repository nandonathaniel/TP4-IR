In 1966 , following the success of his TV series Gilligan 's Island , Sherwood Schwartz conceived the idea for The Brady Bunch after reading in The Los Angeles Times that `` 30 % of marriages ( in the United States ) have a child or children from a previous marriage . '' He set to work on a pilot script for a series tentatively titled Mine and Yours . Schwartz then developed the script to include three children for each parent . While Mike Brady is depicted as being a widower , Schwartz originally wanted the character of Carol Brady to have been a divorc√©e , but the network objected to this . A compromise was reached whereby Carol 's marital status ( whether she was divorced or widowed ) was never directly revealed .
