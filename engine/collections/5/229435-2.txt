The Constitution of Mauritius states that the Outer islands of Mauritius includes the islands of Mauritius , Rodrigues , Agal√©ga , Cargados Carajos and the Chagos Archipelago , including Diego Garcia and any other island comprised in the State of Mauritius . The Government of the Republic of Mauritius has stated that it does not recognise the British Indian Ocean Territory which the United Kingdom created by excising the Chagos Archipelago from the territory of Mauritius prior to its independence , and claims that the Chagos Archipelago including Diego Garcia forms an integral part of the territory of Mauritius under both Mauritian law and international law .
