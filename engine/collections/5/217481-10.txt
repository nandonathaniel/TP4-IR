Although having become one of the most popular Marley songs , `` Sun Is Shining '' used to be a fairly unknown and seldomly - performed number during Marley 's lifetime . Up to date , only two live performances are documented , however both took place under special circumstances . On June 16 , 1978 , Marley performed at The Music Inn in Lenox , Massachusetts , a concert having been rescheduled twice since 1976 , and played an over 2 - hour set . `` Sun Is Shining '' was the opening song , reportedly included spontaneously as it stopped to rain . On July 23 , 1978 , Marley performed an outdoor concert at the Santa Barbara Bowl that included `` Sun Is Shining '' as opening song ; just before the song , Marley introduced the performance by referring to Haile Selassie 's birthday on the same day .
