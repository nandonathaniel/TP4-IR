Shiamak Davar choreographed the dance sequence of `` Bum Bum Bole , '' and was given free rein over its design . He had intended to use 40 students from his dance school , but Khan did not want trained dancers . Davar gave the children certain cues and a general idea of what to do , but left the style and final product up to them to avoid a choreographed appearance . Time constraints meant that while Khan was busy filming `` Bum Bum Bole , '' Ram Madhvani took over as director for `` Bheja Kum '' . The latter sequence , containing a `` fun - filled '' song of rhythmic dialogue , allowed the audience to perceive how Ishaan sees the world and written languages . It was intended to represent `` a young boy 's worst nightmare , in terms of ... the worst thing that he can think of '' ; Madhvani based the visual concept on his son 's fear of `` creepy - crawlies '' such as cockroaches , dragonflies , and lizards . Tata Elxsi 's Visual Computing Labs made the creatures out of the English alphabet and numbers , although Khan insisted they include the Hindi alphabet as not all the audience would be familiar with English . The chalkboard writing 's transformation into a snake was included to surprise the audience and `` end the song on a high note . ''
