Rob and Ellen , Will and Grace 's close friends , are played by Tom Gallop and Leigh - Allyn Baker . Ellen and Grace were best friends since college , as were Rob and Will , and the two couples regularly played charades and other games during dinner parties . Grace also sleeps with Rob in season one when they were both going through break - ups and felt emotionally vulnerable , a fact that did n't come up until Rob and Ellen 's wedding some years later . The couple did get married , however , and have since had three children , the youngest named Roman ( which is the name of Debra Messing 's real - life son , born in 2004 ) . Rob and Ellen want to separate , so that they could begin dating other people , and they announce their separation at a dinner date with Will and Grace . Grace makes them realize that they had worked at their marriage and they should remain together ; and also keenly reminded them that no one else would have them . Rob and Ellen decided to give their marriage another chance .
