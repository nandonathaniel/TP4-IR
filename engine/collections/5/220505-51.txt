Relations between the U.S. and Britain were chilly during the 1860s as Americans resented British and Canadian support for the Confederacy during the Civil War . After the war American authorities looked the other way as Irish Catholic `` Fenians '' plotted and even attempted an invasion of Canada . The Fenians proved a failure , but Irish Catholic politicians , a growing power in the Democratic Party , demanded more independence for Ireland and made anti-British rhetoric -- called `` twisting the lion 's tail '' -- a staple of election campaign appeals to the Irish Catholic vote .
