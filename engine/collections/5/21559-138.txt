Battered by wind , rain and storm surge , some beachfront neighborhoods were completely leveled . Preliminary estimates by Mississippi officials calculated that 90 % of the structures within half a mile of the coastline were completely destroyed , and that storm surges traveled as much as 6 miles ( 10 km ) inland in portions of the state 's coast . One apartment complex with approximately thirty residents seeking shelter inside collapsed . More than half of the 13 casinos in the state , which were floated on barges to comply with Mississippi land - based gambling laws , were washed hundreds of yards inland by waves .
