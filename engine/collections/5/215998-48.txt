In 1975 , Prime Minister Indira Gandhi declared a state of internal emergency after she was indicted in a corruption scandal and ordered to vacate her seat in the Indian Parliament , allowing herself to rule by decree until 1977 . It all started after Raj Narain , who had been defeated in parliamentary election by Indira Gandhi , lodged cases of election fraud and use of state machinery for election purposes against Gandhi in the Allahabad High Court . While some serious charges such as bribing voters and election malpractices were dropped , on 12 June 1975 , Justice Jagmohanlal Sinha of the Allahabad High Court found the Prime Minister guilty on the charge of misuse of government machinery for her election campaign , such as using the state police to build a dais , availing the services of a government officer , Yashpal Kapoor ( IAS ) , during the elections before he had resigned from his position , and use of electricity from the state electricity department . The court declared her election null and void and unseated her from her seat in the Lok Sabha . The court also banned her from contesting any election for an additional six years .
