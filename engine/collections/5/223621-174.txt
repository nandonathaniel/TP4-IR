In the Nine Years ' War ( 1688 -- 1697 ) Louis XIV once again invaded the Spanish Netherlands . French forces led by the Duke of Luxembourg defeated the Spanish at Fleurus ( 1690 ) and subsequently defeated Dutch forces under William III of Orange , who fought on Spain 's side . The war ended with most of the Spanish Netherlands under French occupation , including the important cities of Ghent and Luxembourg . The war revealed to Europe the vulnerability of the Spanish defenses and bureaucracy . Further , the ineffective Spanish Habsburg government took no action to improve them .
