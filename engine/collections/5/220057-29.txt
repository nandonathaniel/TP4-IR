In December 2008 , the Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada reported a critical shortage of obstetricians and gynaecologists . The report stated that 1,370 obstetricians were practicing in Canada and that number is expected to fall by at least one - third within five years . The society is asking the government to increase the number of medical school spots for obstetrics and gynecologists by 30 per cent a year for three years and also recommended rotating placements of doctors into smaller communities to encourage them to take up residence there .
