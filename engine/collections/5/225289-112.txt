In the 1960s , what became known as the Quiet Revolution took place in Quebec , overthrowing the old establishment which centred on the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Quebec and led to modernizing of the economy and society . Québécois nationalists demanded independence , and tensions rose until violence erupted during the 1970 October Crisis . John Saywell says , `` The two kidnappings and the murder of Pierre Laporte were the biggest domestic news stories in Canada 's history '' In 1976 the Parti Québécois was elected to power in Quebec , with a nationalist vision that included securing French linguistic rights in the province and the pursuit of some form of sovereignty for Quebec . This culminated in the 1980 referendum in Quebec on the question of sovereignty - association , which was turned down by 59 % of the voters .
