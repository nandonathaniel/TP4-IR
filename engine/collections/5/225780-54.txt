An olive tree in west Athens , named `` Plato 's Olive Tree '' , is thought to be a remnant of the grove where Plato 's Academy was situated , making it an estimated 2,400 years old . The tree comprised a cavernous trunk from which a few branches were still sprouting in 1975 , when a traffic accident caused a bus to uproot it . Following that , the trunk was preserved and displayed in the nearby Agricultural University of Athens . In 2013 , it was reported that the remaining part of the trunk was uprooted and stolen , allegedly to serve as firewood . A supposedly older tree , the `` Peisistratos Tree '' , is located by the banks of the Cephisus River , in the municipality of Agioi Anargyroi , and is said to be a remnant of an olive grove that was planted by Athenian tyrant Peisistratos in the sixth century BC . Numerous ancient olive trees also exist near Pelion in Greece . The age of an olive tree in Crete , the Finix Olive , is claimed to be over 2,000 years old ; this estimate is based on archaeological evidence around the tree . The olive tree of Vouves , also in Crete , has an age estimated between 2000 and 4000 years . An olive tree called Farga d'Ari√≥ in Ulldecona , Catalonia , Spain , has been dated ( with laser - perimetry methods ) as being 1,701 years old , estimating that it was planted when Constantine the Great was Roman emperor .
