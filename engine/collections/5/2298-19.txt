Its architecture and mosaics were patterned after nearby Byzantine churches and palaces , although its outside appearance has been significantly changed in the Ottoman period and again in the modern period , notably with the addition of the gold - plated roof , in 1959 -- 61 and again in 1993 . The octagonal plan of the structure may have been influenced by the Byzantine Church of the Seat of Mary ( also known as Kathisma in Greek and al - Qadismu in Arabic ) built between 451 and 458 on the road between Jerusalem and Bethlehem .
