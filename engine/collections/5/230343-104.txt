There are certain characteristics of adolescent development that are more rooted in culture than in human biology or cognitive structures . Culture has been defined as the `` symbolic and behavioral inheritance received from the past that provides a community framework for what is valued '' . Culture is learned and socially shared , and it affects all aspects of an individual 's life . Social responsibilities , sexual expression , and belief system development , for instance , are all things that are likely to vary by culture . Furthermore , distinguishing characteristics of youth , including dress , music and other uses of media , employment , art , food and beverage choices , recreation , and language , all constitute a youth culture . For these reasons , culture is a prevalent and powerful presence in the lives of adolescents , and therefore we can not fully understand today 's adolescents without studying and understanding their culture . However , `` culture '' should not be seen as synonymous with nation or ethnicity . Many cultures are present within any given country and racial or socioeconomic group . Furthermore , to avoid ethnocentrism , researchers must be careful not to define the culture 's role in adolescence in terms of their own cultural beliefs .
