Jonas 's father is concerned about an infant at the Nurturing Center who is failing to thrive , and has received special permission to bring him home at night . The baby 's name will be Gabriel if he grows strong enough to be assigned to a family . He has pale eyes , like Jonas and the Giver , and Jonas becomes attached to him , especially when Jonas finds that he is capable of being given memories . If Gabriel does not increase in strength , he will be `` released from the Community , '' also in common speech termed being taken Elsewhere . This has happened to an off - course air pilot , to chronic rule breakers , to elderly people , and to the apprentice Rosemary . After Jonas casually speculates as to life in Elsewhere , the Giver educates him by showing the boy hidden - camera video of Jonas 's father doing his job : as two identical community members can not be allowed , Jonas 's father releases the smaller of identical twin newborns by injecting the baby with poison before putting the body in a trash chute . There is no Elsewhere for those not wanted by the Community , those said to have been `` released '' have been killed .
