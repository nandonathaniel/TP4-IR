Notable exceptions are reddish copper and yellowish gold . The reason for their color is that there is an upper limit to the frequency of the light that metallic electrons can readily respond to , the plasmon frequency . At the plasmon frequency , the frequency - dependent dielectric function of the free electron gas goes from negative ( reflecting ) to positive ( transmitting ) ; higher frequency photons are not reflected at the surface , and do not contribute to the color of the metal . There are some materials like indium tin oxide ( ITO ) that are metallic conductors ( actually degenerate semiconductors ) for which this threshold is in the infrared , which is why they are transparent in the visible , but good mirrors in the IR .
