Robinson claimed that it was his 1940 card sketch that served as the character 's concept , and which Finger associated with Veidt 's portrayal . Kane hired the 17 - year - old Robinson as an assistant in 1939 , after he saw Robinson in a white jacket decorated with his own illustrations . Beginning as a letterer and background inker , Robinson quickly became primary artist for the newly created Batman comic book series . In a 1975 interview in The Amazing World of DC Comics , Robinson said he wanted a supreme arch - villain who could test Batman , but not a typical crime lord or gangster designed to be easily disposed . He wanted an exotic , enduring character as an ongoing source of conflict for Batman ( similar to the relationship between Sherlock Holmes and Professor Moriarty ) , designing a diabolically sinister - but - clownish villain . Robinson was intrigued by villains ; his studies at Columbia University taught him that some characters are made up of contradictions , leading to the Joker 's sense of humor . He said that the name came first , followed by an image of a playing card from a deck he often had at hand : `` I wanted somebody visually exciting . I wanted somebody that would make an indelible impression , would be bizarre , would be memorable like the Hunchback of Notre Dame or any other villains that had unique physical characters . '' He told Finger about his concept by telephone , later providing sketches of the character and images of what would become his iconic Joker playing - card design . Finger thought the concept was incomplete , providing the image of Veidt with a ghastly , permanent rictus grin .
