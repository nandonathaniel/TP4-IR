As Jesus labors to carry a heavy wooden cross along the Via Dolorosa to Calvary , a woman avoids the escort of soldiers , and wipes Jesus ' face with her veil . Jesus is beaten and pressed by the guards until the unwilling Simon of Cyrene is forced into carrying the cross with him . At the end of their travel , with his mother Mary , Mary Magdalene , and others witnessing , Jesus is crucified . The very act seems to affect the weather conditions of the earth itself .
