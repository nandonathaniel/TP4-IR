Initially the rules were decided by the Northern Rugby Football Union , today 's Rugby Football League , the governing body for rugby league in the United Kingdom . As the sport spread to around the world , other rugby leagues were established , notably in Australia , France and New Zealand , a more international approach was adopted . In 1948 , the International Rugby League Board ( IRLB ) was formed . Initially the RFL retained this responsibility for the Laws while it was seen how the new Board would develop . The IRLB was invested with responsibility for the Laws later .
