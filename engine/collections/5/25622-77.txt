Lunar Edomae ( 江戸前 留 奈 , Edomae Runa ) Voiced by : Sakura Nogawa ( Japanese ) ; Cherami Leigh ( English ) Lunar is a childhood friend and rival of Sun . She has used the powers of her mermaid voice to become an idol singer . She seems to suffer from a superiority complex , and she never passes up an attempt to overshadow Sun . She initially thought that Sun was boasting Nagasumi to her , and in an attempt to outdo Sun she decides to steal him away from her by making Nagasumi her servant , since Nagasumi has also seen her mermaid form . Later she decides to live in Nagasumi 's house until his servant status is over . It was unclear if she has developed a liking to him ( since she has decided to learn how to cook and make him a packed lunch , although still in an attempt to beat Sun ) . However , it is then revealed that she does in fact have feelings for Nagasumi , and planned on marrying him , but this is stopped by Sun , though she continues living with him even after her wedding is canceled . In the manga , Lunar accepts Nagasumi into her family during the commotion of the wedding ; therefore , she is also technically married to Nagasumi . Sun accepts her decision and they both put an end to the war caused by Sun 's interference . Lunar controls her own personal bodyguards made up of the boys of Isono Junior High school and she often calls them in to defend her , using them like her own personal army . They are currently at war with Sun 's bodyguards . Lunar usually refers to herself in plural form ( `` us '' , `` we '' , `` our '' and so on ) , and has a trademark `` hohoho '' laugh that can be heard before she enters the scene . She , like most other mermaids , has a fear of cats .
