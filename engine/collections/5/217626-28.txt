Adequate cooling of the surface typically takes place when it loses more energy by infrared radiation than it receives as solar radiation from the sun , which is especially the case on clear nights . Poor thermal conductivity restricts the replacement of such losses from deeper ground layers , which are typically warmer at night . Preferred objects of dew formation are thus poor conducting or well isolated from the ground , and non-metallic , while shiny metal coated surfaces are poor infrared radiators . Preferred weather conditions include the absence of clouds and little water vapor in the higher atmosphere to minimize greenhouse effects and sufficient humidity of the air near the ground . Typical dew nights are classically considered calm , because the wind transports ( nocturnally ) warmer air from higher levels to the cold surface . However , if the atmosphere is the major source of moisture ( this type is called dewfall ) , a certain amount of ventilation is needed to replace the vapor that is already condensed . The highest optimum wind speeds could be found on arid islands . If the wet soil beneath is the major source of vapor , however ( this type of dew formation is called distillation ) , wind always seems adverse .
