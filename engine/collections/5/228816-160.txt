After passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 , most Southerners accepted the integration of most institutions ( except public schools ) . With the old barrier to becoming a Republican removed , Southerners joined the new middle class and the Northern transplants in moving toward the Republican Party . Integration thus liberated Southern politics from the old racial issues . In 1963 , the federal courts declared unconstitutional the practice of excluding African - American voters from the Democratic primaries , which had been the only elections that mattered in most of the South . Meanwhile , the newly enfranchised black voters supported Democratic candidates at the 85 -- 90 % level , a shift which further convinced many white segregationists that the Republicans were no longer the black party .
