Simon , who faints frequently and is likely an epileptic , has a secret hideaway where he goes to be alone . One day while he is there , Jack and his followers erect a faux sacrifice to the beast nearby : a pig 's head , mounted on a sharpened stick and soon swarming with scavenging flies . Simon conducts an imaginary dialogue with the head , which he dubs the `` Lord of the Flies '' . The head mocks Simon 's notion that the beast is a real entity , `` something you could hunt and kill '' , and reveals the truth : they , the boys , are the beast ; it is inside them all . The Lord of the Flies also warns Simon that he is in danger , because he represents the soul of man , and predicts that the others will kill him . Simon climbs the mountain alone and discovers that the `` beast '' is the dead parachutist . He rushes down to tell the other boys , who are engaged in a ritual dance . The frenzied boys mistake Simon for the beast , attack him , and beat him to death . Both Ralph and Piggy participate in the melee , and they become deeply disturbed by their actions after returning from Castle Rock .
