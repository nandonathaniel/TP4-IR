Another franchise that the Bulls have competed fiercely with is the New York Knicks . The two teams met in the playoffs in four consecutive years ( 1991 -- 94 ) and again in 1996 , with the teams ' series twice ( 1992 and 1994 ) going the full seven games . Their first playoff confrontation , however , came in 1989 when both teams were called `` teams on the rise '' under Michael Jordan and Patrick Ewing , respectively ( rivalry that started their freshman year in the 1982 NCAA Men 's Division I Basketball Championship Game with Jordan hitting the deciding jumper of the final ) . That first confrontation would belong to Chicago within six games of the Eastern Semifinals . The Bulls triumphed in the first three years ( 1991 -- 93 ) before narrowly losing in 1994 but exacted revenge in 1996 . As with Detroit , the historic rivalry between the cities has led to animosity between the teams and occasionally their fans .
