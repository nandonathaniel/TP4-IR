After the 1804 Louisiana Purchase , Lewis and Clark visited the confluence of the Kansas and Missouri rivers , noting it was a good place to build a fort .

They built the first school within Kansas City 's current boundaries , but were forced out by mob violence in 1833 and their settlement remained vacant .
