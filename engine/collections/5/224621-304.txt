Originally , mail was not delivered to homes and businesses , but to post offices . In 1863 , `` city delivery '' began in urban areas with enough customers to make this economical . This required streets to be named , houses to be numbered , with sidewalks and lighting provided , and these street addresses to be added to envelopes . The number of routes served expanded over time . In 1891 , the first experiments with Rural Free Delivery began in less densely populated areas . There is currently an effort to reduce direct delivery in favor of mailbox clusters .
