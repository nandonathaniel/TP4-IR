The Cool Ranch Doritos taco began being sold in stores March 7 , 2013 . Shortly before launch , Taco Bell launched a promotion advertising that fans could get the new flavor at its stores a day early if they `` just asked '' on March 6 . However , they neglected to inform the majority of their stores of this -- leading to numerous complaints on its social media sites and news sites from disappointed consumers who were unable to obtain the new taco .
