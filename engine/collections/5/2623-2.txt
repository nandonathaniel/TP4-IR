Transvaginal ultrasonography showing a gestational sac with a diameter of 28 mm , corresponding to a gestational age of approximately 7 weeks and 5 days . It contains a yolk sac ( protruding from its lower part ) but no embryo , even after scanning across all planes of the gestational sac , thus being diagnostic of an anembryonic gestation .
