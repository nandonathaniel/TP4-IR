The western rose , made c. 1215 and 12 m in diameter shows the Last Judgement -- a traditional theme for west fa√ßades . A central oculus showing Christ as the Judge is surrounded by an inner ring of 12 paired roundels containing angels and the Elders of the Apocalypse and an outer ring of 12 roundels showing the dead emerging from their tombs and the angels blowing trumpets to summon them to judgement .
