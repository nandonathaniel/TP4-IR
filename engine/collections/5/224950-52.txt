Every year on New Year 's Eve , the Space Needle celebrates with a fireworks show at midnight that is synchronized to music . The worldwide renowned fireworks artist from Bellevue , Alberto Navarro has been designing the show for the past 20 year since inception in 1994 . In 2000 , public celebrations were canceled but the fireworks show was still performed because of perceived terror threats against the structure after investigations into the foiled millennium bombing plots .
