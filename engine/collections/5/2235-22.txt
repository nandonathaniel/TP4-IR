Mendacity is a recurring theme throughout the play . Brick uses the word to express his disgust with the `` lies and liars '' he sees around him , and with complicated rules of social conduct in Southern society and culture . Big Daddy states that Brick 's disgust with mendacity is really disgust with himself for rejecting Skipper before his suicide . With the exception of Brick , the entire family lies to Big Daddy and Big Mama about his terminal cancer . Furthermore , Big Daddy lies to his wife , and Gooper and Mae exhibit avaricious motives in their attempt to secure Big Daddy 's estate .
