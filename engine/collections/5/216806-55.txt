In 1968 , the record company EMI formed a new company called EMI Films , headed by producers Barry Spikings and Michael Deeley . Deeley purchased the first draft of a spec script called The Man Who Came to Play , written by Louis Garfinkle and Quinn K. Redeker , for $19,000 . The spec script was about people who go to Las Vegas to play Russian roulette . `` The screenplay had struck me as brilliant , '' wrote Deeley , `` but it was n't complete . The trick would be to find a way to turn a very clever piece of writing into a practical , realizable film . '' When the movie was being planned during the mid-1970s , Vietnam was still a taboo subject with all major Hollywood studios . According to producer Michael Deeley , the standard response was `` no American would want to see a picture about Vietnam '' .
