Atticus Finch is the middle - aged father of Jem and Scout Finch . He is a lawyer and was once known as `` the deadliest shot in Maycomb County '' . Although he was a good shot , he does not like to mention the fact as he does not like the thought of having an advantage over people . He appears to support racial equality and was appointed to represent Tom Robinson , a black man who has been accused of raping a young white woman , Mayella Ewell . The town disapproves of him defending Tom especially when he makes clear his intent to defend Tom Robinson to the best of his abilities . He is portrayed by Gregory Peck in the film adaptation of To Kill a Mockingbird .
