A `` comfort hug '' , auctioned in April 2005 to promote love and good feelings . The auction received considerable media attention . In October 2005 a man attempted to sell a dolphin he accidentally caught while net fishing . This later turned out to be a hoax . In late 2005 , a member offered a `` time machine '' for sale through auction ( or swap for an `` anti gravity machine '' ) , with the highest bid reaching $300,000,000,001,999 . The seller withdrew the auction shortly before its close time . News of the auction reached some New Zealand newspapers , which ran a story on it . This auction used to hold the record for the highest number of questions asked and answered . In 2006 a user attempted to auction the Optus B1 satellite following a malfunction . The opening price started at NZ $200,000,000 . Trade Me withdrew the auction after 231,908 page views . In May 2006 a member tried to sell Australia , using humorous descriptions of the country . The auction drew over 100 questions , and had more than 11,000 views . The country achieved a bid of $200,045,400 , with a reserve price of 50 cents . In the end however , Trade Me administrators withdrew the auction . One News ( a broadcast television programme ) ran a report on this auction . Also in May 2006 a member tried to sell his leg -- amputated a year earlier as a result of diabetes . Trade Me withdrew the auction within hours and swiftly added `` Body Parts '' to the `` Prohibited Items '' list . In June 2006 Lisa Lewis streaked across the field at the All Blacks game against Ireland held at Waikato Stadium . Days later the bikini Lewis had worn ended up for auction . The winning bid of $4,010 later proved not genuine In October 2007 Lisa - Marie Corlet stumbled across a pebble with markings allegedly resembling the Virgin Mary . A first auction completed , but the bids later proved invalid . Corlet went on a nationwide television programme , Campbell Live , to announce she would not accept anything less than NZ $ 78,662,500,000 as she believes that someone would very much treasure the item . She said she was non-religious and offered this as the reason why she chose to on - sell the pebble . It was one of the most highly viewed auctions on Trade Me , with over 100,000 views , but the pebble failed to sell . On 17 November 2008 Lixtor attempted to auction their auction site following dispute with Trade Me over copyright - infringement allegations . The opening price started at NZ $100,000,000 . Trade Me withdrew the auction after a few hours . February 2010 : The Trade Me user rhorne listed a lemon ; with the letters `` XT '' printed vividly upon it ; for sale with a humorous description . This was designed to mock the XT Mobile Network due to its intermittent outages ( which caused significant inconvenience to customers and delayed emergency service responses ) and other flaws . There were some suggestions made on the auction that the proceeds should be donated to charity , however the seller made it clear that was not his intention . The auction sold for $1,155 . In February 2012 , Labour MP Trevor Mallard was accused of ticket scalping on Trade Me when he sold four tickets to the Homegrown music festival for a $246 profit . The MP had in 2006 initiated legislation , the Major Events Management Act 2007 , prohibiting ticket scalping for major events ( although Homegrown was n't classified as a `` major event '' so was n't covered ) . He later offered to refund the money he received for the tickets . In June 2012 , the Greater Wellington Regional Council listed a two - car DM / D `` English Electric '' electric multiple unit for sale . The listing was put up on the same day the last of the units were withdrawn after 74 years of revenue service on the Wellington commuter lines , and claimed having done 4.5 million kilometres and having four million previous owners when state - owned . After one false bid accidentally placed by a four - year - old , the unit ( motor car DM 562 and trailer car D 2786 ) was bought for $30,000 by a bidder from Nelson , who planned to convert the unit into accommodation . In February 2013 , four students ( Damien Taylor , Ronan Broad , Scott Allan , and Alex Woodham ) flatting in Christchurch listed their 43 '' Toshiba television , initially using a photo of the TV running the popular game Jonah Lomu Rugby TM as a selling point . As the auction progressed , however , they began to upload a number of comedic photos demonstrating their intimate relationship with the TV . Depicting the four variously playing Jonah Lomu Rugby TM in the bath , taking the TV to feed the ducks , supporting the TV as it busked outside a local supermarket , and , most notably , accompanying the TV on a punt down the river Avon , the auction quickly became a public sensation and was featured in the National Headlines on Stuff.co.nz as well as being acknowledged by The Christchurch Press and national New Zealand radio station The Edge . The auction received well over 150 , 000 views and over 200 comments . As a charity auction all proceeds were donated to the Jonah Lomu Kidney Kids Foundation .
