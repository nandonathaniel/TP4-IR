It is difficult to get co-operation from cellphone users , because in many parts of the US , users are charged for both outgoing and incoming calls . That means that pollsters have had to offer financial compensation to gain co-operation . US federal law prohibits the use of automated dialling devices to call cellphones ( Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991 ) . Numbers therefore have to be dialled by hand , which is more time - consuming and expensive for pollsters .
