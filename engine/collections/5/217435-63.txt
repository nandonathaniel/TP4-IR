There are three jurisdictional requirements in the Rome Statute that must be met before a case may begin against an individual . The requirements are ( 1 ) subject - matter jurisdiction ( what acts constitute crimes ) , ( 2 ) territorial or personal jurisdiction ( where the crimes were committed or who committed them ) , and ( 3 ) temporal jurisdiction ( when the crimes were committed ) .
