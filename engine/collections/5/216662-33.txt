The current southern Rockies were forced upwards through the layers of Pennsylvanian and Permian sedimentary remnants of the Ancestral Rocky Mountains . Such sedimentary remnants were often tilted at steep angles along the flanks of the modern range ; they are now visible in many places throughout the Rockies , and are shown along the Dakota Hogback , an early Cretaceous sandstone formation running along the eastern flank of the modern Rockies .
