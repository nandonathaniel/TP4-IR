Today it is one of the most famous and recognizable buildings in the world and while the large , domed marble mausoleum is the most familiar part of the monument , the Taj Mahal is an extensive complex of buildings and gardens that extends over 22.44 hectares ( 55.5 acres ) and includes subsidiary tombs , waterworks infrastructure , the small town of ' Taj Ganji ' to the south and a ' moonlight garden ' to the north of the river . Construction of Taj Mahal began in 1632 AD , ( 1041 AH ) , on the south bank of the River Yamuna in Agra , and was substantially complete by 1648 AD ( 1058 AH ) . The design was conceived as both an earthly replica of the house of Mumtaz Mahal in paradise and an instrument of propaganda for the emperor .
