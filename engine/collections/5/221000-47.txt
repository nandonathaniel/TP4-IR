The English noun mass is derived from Middle Latin missa . The Latin word was adopted in Old English as m√¶sse ( via a Vulgar Latin form * messa ) , and was sometimes glossed as sendnes ( i.e. `` a sending , dismission '' ) . The Latin term missa itself was in use by the 6th century . It is most likely derived from the concluding formula Ite , missa est ( `` Go ; the dismissal is made '' ) ; missa here is a Late Latin substantive corresponding to classical missio .
