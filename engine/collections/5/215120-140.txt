The catalase test is one of the three main tests used by microbiologists to identify species of bacteria . If the bacteria possess catalase ( i.e. , are catalase - positive ) , when a small amount of bacterial isolate is added to hydrogen peroxide , bubbles of oxygen are observed . The catalase test is done by placing a drop of hydrogen peroxide on a microscope slide . An applicator stick is touched to the colony , and the tip is then smeared onto the hydrogen peroxide drop .
