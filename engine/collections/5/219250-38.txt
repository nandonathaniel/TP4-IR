Chloride channels : This superfamily of channels consists of approximately 13 members . They include ClCs , CLICs , Bestrophins and CFTRs . These channels are non-selective for small anions ; however chloride is the most abundant anion , and hence they are known as chloride channels . Potassium channels Voltage - gated potassium channels e.g. , Kvs , Kirs etc . Calcium - activated potassium channels e.g. , BKCa or MaxiK , SK , etc . Inward - rectifier potassium channels Two - pore - domain potassium channels : This family of 15 members form what is known as leak channels , and they display Goldman - Hodgkin - Katz ( open ) rectification . Sodium channels Voltage - gated sodium channels ( NaVs ) Epithelial sodium channels ( ENaCs ) Calcium channels ( CaVs ) Proton channels Voltage - gated proton channels Non-selective cation channels : These non-selectively allow many types of cations , mainly Na , K and Ca , through the channel . Most transient receptor potential channels
