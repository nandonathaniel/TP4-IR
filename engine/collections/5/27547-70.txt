Though much of Roman civilization north of the Po River had been wiped out in the years after the end of the Western Roman Empire , between the 5th and 8th centuries , new political and social infrastructure began to develop . Much of this was initially Germanic and pagan . Arian Christian missionaries had been spreading Arian Christianity throughout northern Europe , though by 700 the religion of northern Europeans was largely a mix of Germanic paganism , Christianized paganism , and Arian Christianity . Catholic Christianity had barely started to spread in northern Europe by this time . Through the practice of simony , local princes typically auctioned off ecclesiastical offices , causing priests and bishops to function as though they were yet another noble under the patronage of the prince . In contrast , a network of monasteries had sprung up as monks sought separation from the world . These monasteries remained independent from local princes , and as such constituted the `` church '' for most northern Europeans during this time . Being independent from local princes , they increasingly stood out as centres of learning , of scholarship , and as religious centres where individuals could receive spiritual or monetary assistance .
