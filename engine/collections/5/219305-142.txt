West Germany 's relations with East Germany posed particularly difficult questions . Though anxious to relieve serious hardships for divided families and to reduce friction , West Germany under Brandt 's Ostpolitik was intent on holding to its concept of `` two German states in one German nation . '' Relations gradually improved . In the early 1970s , the Ostpolitik led to a form of mutual recognition between East and West Germany . The Treaty of Moscow ( August 1970 ) , the Treaty of Warsaw ( December 1970 ) , the Four Power Agreement on Berlin ( September 1971 ) , the Transit Agreement ( May 1972 ) , and the Basic Treaty ( December 1972 ) helped to normalise relations between East and West Germany and led to both states joining the United Nations , in September 1973 . The two German states exchanged permanent representatives in 1974 , and , in 1987 , East German head of state Erich Honecker paid an official visit to West Germany .
