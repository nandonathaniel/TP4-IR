With the widespread sales of televisions after World War II , producers spun out a large number of western - oriented shows . At the height of their popularity in 1959 , there were more than two dozen `` cowboy '' programs on each week . At least six of them were directly or indirectly connected with Wyatt Earp : The Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp , Bat Masterson , Tombstone Territory , Broken Arrow , Johnny Ringo , and Gunsmoke . Hugh O'Brian portrayed Earp on the namesake show Wyatt Earp which ran for six seasons , and he was forever associated with that role .
