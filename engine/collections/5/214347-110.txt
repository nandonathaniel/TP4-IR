Generally speaking , the intensity of a tropical cyclone is determined by either the storm 's maximum sustained winds or lowest barometric pressure . The following table lists the most intense Atlantic hurricanes in terms of their lowest barometric pressure . In terms of wind speed , Allen from 1980 was the strongest Atlantic tropical cyclone on record , with maximum sustained winds of 190 mph ( 310 km / h ) . For many years , it was thought that Hurricane Camille also attained this intensity , but this conclusion was changed in 2014 . The original measurements of Camille are suspect since wind speed instrumentation used at the time would likely be damaged by winds of such intensity . Nonetheless , their central pressures are low enough to rank them among the strongest recorded Atlantic hurricanes .
