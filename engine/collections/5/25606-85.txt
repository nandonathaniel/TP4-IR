The film was announced via Variety in December 2012 . Bobin was first approached about the project while doing post-production work on Muppets Most Wanted , Of being asked , Bobin has said that `` I just could n't pass it up '' , as he has a passion for the works of Lewis Carroll as well as history in general . In July 2013 , it was announced that Johnny Depp would return as the Hatter , with Mia Wasikowska 's return confirmed the following November . In January 2014 Sacha Baron Cohen joined the cast to play Time . In May 2014 , Rhys Ifans joined the cast to play Zanik Hightopp , the Mad Hatter 's father . In developing the character of `` Time '' , Bobin sought to avoid creating a `` straight - up bad guy '' , noting that it would be `` a bit dull '' , and also that the role in that universe already existed in the form of The Red Queen . Instead , Bobin sought to make Time a `` Twit '' , further explaining that `` There 's no one better at playing the confident idiot trope than Sacha Baron Cohen '' , and adding that `` it was very much with Sacha in mind '' .
