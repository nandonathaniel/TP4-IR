Like the FIFA World Cup , the UEFA Champions League is sponsored by a group of multinational corporations , in contrast to the single main sponsor typically found in national top - flight leagues . When the Champions League was created in 1992 , it was decided that a maximum of eight companies should be allowed to sponsor the event , with each corporation being allocated four advertising boards around the perimeter of the pitch , as well as logo placement at pre - and post-match interviews and a certain number of tickets to each match . This , combined with a deal to ensure tournament sponsors were given priority on television advertisements during matches , ensured that each of the tournament 's main sponsors was given maximum exposure .
