In 1928 , Harry Ramsden opened his first fish and chip shop in Guiseley , West Yorkshire . On a single day in 1952 , the shop served 10,000 portions of fish and chips , earning a place in the Guinness Book of Records . In George Orwell 's The Road to Wigan Pier ( 1937 ) , which documents his experience of working class life in the north of England , the author considered fish and chips chief among the ' home comforts ' which acted as a panacea to the working classes . During World War II , fish and chips remained one of the few foods in the United Kingdom not subject to rationing . Prime Minister Winston Churchill referred to the combination of fish and chips as `` the good companions '' . John Lennon enjoyed his fish and chips -- a staple of the working class -- smothered in ketchup .
