Sewanee was a charter member of the Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Association in 1894 . The Sewanee Tigers were pioneers in American intercollegiate athletics and possessed the Deep South 's preeminent football program in the 1890s . The 1899 football team had perhaps the best season in college football history , winning all 12 of their games , 11 by shutout , and outscoring their opponents 322 - 10 . Five of those wins , all shutouts , came in a six - day period while on a 2,500 - mile ( 4,000 km ) trip by train . In 2012 , the College Football Hall of Fame held a vote of the greatest historic teams of all time , where the 1899 Iron Men beat the 1961 Alabama Crimson Tide as the greatest team of all time .
