The British component remained the largest component of the migrant intake until 1953 . Between 1953 and late 1956 , migrants from Southern Europe outnumbered the British , and this caused some alarm in the Australian government , causing it to place restrictions on Southern Europeans sponsoring newcomers and to commence the `` Bring out a Briton '' campaign . With the increase in financial assistance to British settlers provided during the 1960s , the British component was able to return to the top position in the overall number of new settlers .
