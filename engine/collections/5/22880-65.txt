DDE : `` Dynamic Data Exchange '' uses the message passing mechanism in Windows to allow data to flow between Excel and other applications . Although it is easy for users to create such links , programming such links reliably is so difficult that Microsoft , the creators of the system , officially refer to it as `` the protocol from hell '' . In spite of its many issues DDE remains the most common way for data to reach traders in financial markets . Network DDE Extended the protocol to allow spreadsheets on different computers to exchange data . Starting with Windows Vista , Microsoft no longer supports the facility . Real Time Data : RTD although in many ways technically superior to DDE , has been slow to gain acceptance , since it requires non-trivial programming skills , and when first released was neither adequately documented nor supported by the major data vendors .
