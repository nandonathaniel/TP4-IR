The Middle English period saw further vowel changes . Most significant was the Great Vowel Shift ( c. 1500 CE ) , which transformed the pronunciation of all long vowels . This occurred after the spelling system was fixed , and accounts for the drastic differences in pronunciation between `` short '' mat , met , bit , cot vs. `` long '' mate , mete / meet , bite , coat . Other changes that left echoes in the modern language were homorganic lengthening before ld , mb , nd , which accounts for the long vowels in child , mind , climb , etc. ; pre-cluster shortening , which resulted in the vowel alternations in child vs. children , keep vs. kept , meet vs. met ; and trisyllabic laxing , which is responsible for alternations such as grateful vs. gratitude , divine vs. divinity , sole vs. solitary .
