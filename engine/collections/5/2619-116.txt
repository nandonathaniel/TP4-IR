Ryanair was subject to widespread criticism after it announced that it would be cancelling between 40 and 50 flights per day ( about 2 % of total daily flights ) during September and October 2017 . Flights were cancelled with very little notice , sometimes only hours before departure . People who had already taken outbound flights were left with no flight home . Ryanair said that the cancellations aimed `` to improve its system - wide punctuality '' which had dropped significantly in the first two weeks of September , which the airline attributed to `` ATC capacity delays and strikes , weather disruptions and the impact of increased holiday allocations to pilots and cabin crew '' . In subsequent statements , Ryanair acknowledged that it had `` messed up '' holiday schedules for pilots , including a change to the calendar year for how vacations were calculated .
