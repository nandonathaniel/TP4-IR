`` French plays no role in the very formal situation of a Haitian peasant ( more than 80 % of the population make a living from agriculture ) presiding at a family gathering after the death of a member , or at the worship of the family lwa or voodoo spirits , or contacting a Catholic priest for a church baptism , marriage , or solemn mass , or consulting a physician , nurse , or dentist , or going to a civil officer to declare a death or birth .
