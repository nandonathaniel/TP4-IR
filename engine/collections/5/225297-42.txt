The `` Fair Youth '' is the unnamed young man addressed by the devoted poet in the greatest sequence of the sonnets ( 1 -- 126 ) . The young man is handsome , self - centered , universally admired and much sought after . The sequence begins with the poet urging the young man to marry and father children ( sonnets 1 - 17 ) . It continues with the friendship developing with the poet 's loving admiration , which at times is homoerotic in nature . Then comes a set of betrayals by the young man , as he is seduced by the Dark Lady , and they maintain a liaison ( sonnets 133 , 134 & 144 ) , all of which the poet struggles to abide . It concludes with the poet 's own act of betrayal , resulting in his independence from the fair youth ( sonnet 152 ) .
