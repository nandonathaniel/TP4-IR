The band began another world tour in support of Stadium Arcadium in 2006 , beginning with promotional concerts in Europe and culminating in a two - month - long European tour from late May to mid-July . During this tour Frusciante 's friend and frequent musical collaborator Josh Klinghoffer joined the touring band , contributing guitar parts , back up vocals , and keyboards . Klinghoffer 's presence allowed the live performances of songs to sound more like the recorded versions , in which Frusciante laid down multiple tracks himself . The group toured North America from early August to early November , returning to Europe later in November for a second leg , that ran until mid-December . The Chili Peppers began 2007 with a second North American leg , this time including Mexico , from mid-January to mid-March . This was followed by April shows in various cities in Australia and New Zealand and concerts in Japan in early June . The Peppers concluded their tour with a third European leg from late June to late August . They appeared at the Live Earth concert at London 's Wembley Stadium on July 7 , 2007 . The band appeared at several festivals , including Denmarks Roskilde festival , Ireland 's Oxegen in July 2006 , Lollapalooza in August 2006 in Grant Park , Chicago , a subsequent set at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival in Indio , California in late April 2007 and in August 2007 they appeared as one of three headliners at the Reading and Leeds festivals along with Razorlight and Smashing Pumpkins .
