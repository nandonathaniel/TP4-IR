The bombing of Darwin on 19 February 1942 was the largest single attack ever mounted by a foreign power on Australia . In an effort to isolate Australia , the Japanese planned a seaborne invasion of Port Moresby , in the Australian Territory of New Guinea . Between July and November 1942 , Australian forces repulsed Japanese attempts on the city by way of the Kokoda Track , in the highlands of New Guinea . The Battle of Buna -- Gona , between November 1942 and January 1943 , set the tone for the bitter final stages of the New Guinea campaign , which persisted into 1945 . The offensives in Papua and New Guinea of 1943 -- 44 were the single largest series of connected operations ever mounted by the Australian armed forces .
