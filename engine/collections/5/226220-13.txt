In the fall , the event is repeated , but is called an `` Alpabzug '' , as the animals return from the high meadow . The best cows ( each referred to as a Kranzkuh , i.e. `` crown ( ed ) cow '' , after the ornamental headwear with which it is adorned ) from each herd again lead the procession . The traditional festival is called Viehscheid in Southern Germany , and has other names in the Alpine regions .
