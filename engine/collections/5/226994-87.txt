Bulgarian resistance revived under the leadership of the Cometopuli dynasty , but the new emperor Basil II ( reigned 976 -- 1025 AD ) made the submission of the Bulgarians his primary goal . Basil 's first expedition against Bulgaria however resulted in a humiliating defeat at the Gates of Trajan . For the next few years , the emperor would be preoccupied with internal revolts in Anatolia , while the Bulgarians expanded their realm in the Balkans . The war was to drag on for nearly twenty years . The Byzantine victories of Spercheios and Skopje decisively weakened the Bulgarian army , and in annual campaigns , Basil methodically reduced the Bulgarian strongholds . Eventually , at the Battle of Kleidion in 1014 the Bulgarians were completely defeated . The Bulgarian army was captured , and it is said that 99 out of every 100 men were blinded , with the remaining hundredth man left with one eye so as to lead his compatriots home . When Tsar Samuil saw the broken remains of his once gallant army , he died of shock . By 1018 , the last Bulgarian strongholds had surrendered , and the country became part of the empire . This epic victory restored the Danube frontier , which had not been held since the days of the emperor Heraclius .
