In 1928 , Jenna Lira brought a totem pole as a souvenir from Alaska and placed it in front of the store . The pole served as a marketing tool for the company , as it attracted a great deal of attention . Soon , executives added totem poles in front of every store and eventually adopted an Alaska Native - inspired theme for their stores . Later on , the stores began operating under the name `` Tote 'm Stores '' . In the same year , the company began constructing gasoline stations in some of its Dallas locations as an experiment . Joe Thompson also provided a distinct characteristic to the company 's stores , training the staff so that people would receive the same quality and service in every store . Southland also started to have a uniform for its ice station service boys . This became the major factor in the company 's success as a retail convenience store .
