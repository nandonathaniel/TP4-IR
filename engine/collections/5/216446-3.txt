No official Wi - Fi or flash memory card readers were ever released by Sony for the 20 GB system , although Sony had plans to do so . As of September 2009 , Sony had placed no further emphasis on these proposed add - ons . Nevertheless , as the model features four USB 2.0 ports , wireless networking and flash memory card support can already be obtained through the use of widely available external USB adapters and third - party PS3 - specific media hubs .
