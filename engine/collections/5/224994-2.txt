A degree of uncertainty surrounds the origin of the English word `` saffron '' . It might stem from the 12th - century Old French term safran , which comes from the Latin word safranum , from the Arabic az - za'faran , which comes from the Persian word zarparan meaning `` flower with golden petals '' .
