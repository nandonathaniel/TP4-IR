In 1878 , Garrett built a 14 - foot ( 4.3 m ) long hand - cranked submarine of about 4.5 tons , which he named the Resurgam . This was followed by the second ( and more famous ) Resurgam of 1879 , built by Cochran & Co. at Birkenhead , England . The construction was of iron plates fastened to iron frames , with the central section of the vessel clad with wood secured by iron straps . As built , it was 45 feet ( 14 m ) long by 10 feet ( 3.0 m ) in diameter , weighed 30 long tons ( 30 t ) , and had a crew of 3 . Resurgam was powered by a closed cycle steam engine , which provided enough steam to turn the single propeller for up to 4 hours . It was designed to have positive buoyancy , and diving was controlled by a pair of hydroplanes amidships . At the time it cost Â£ 1,538 .
