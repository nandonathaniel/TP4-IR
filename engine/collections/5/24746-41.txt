Terrence Howard as James `` Rhodey '' Rhodes : A friend of Stark 's , and the liaison between Stark Industries and the United States Air Force in the department of acquisitions , specifically weapons development . Favreau cast Howard because he felt he could play War Machine in a sequel . Howard prepared for the role by visiting Nellis Air Force Base on March 16 , 2007 , where he ate with the pilots and observed HH - 60 Pave Hawk rescue helicopters and F - 22 Raptors . While Rhodes is roguish in the comics after he met Stark , his earlier disciplinarian character forms a dynamic with Stark , and he is unsure whether or not Stark 's actions are acceptable . `` Rhodey is completely disgusted with the way Tony has lived his life , but at a certain point he realizes that perhaps there is a different way , '' Howard said . `` Whose life is the right way ; is it the strict military life , or the life of an independent ? '' Howard and his father are Iron Man fans , partly because Rhodes was one of the few black superheroes when he was a child . He was a Downey fan since he saw him in Weird Science , and the two competed physically on set .
