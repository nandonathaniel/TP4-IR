Google 's homepage includes a button labeled `` I 'm Feeling Lucky '' . This feature originally allowed users to type in their search query , click the button and be taken directly to the first result , bypassing the search results page . With the 2010 announcement of Google Instant , an automatic feature that immediately displays relevant results as users are typing in their query , the `` I 'm Feeling Lucky '' button disappears , requiring that users opt - out of Instant results through search settings in order to keep using the `` I 'm Feeling Lucky '' functionality . In 2012 , `` I 'm Feeling Lucky '' was changed to serve as an advertisement for Google services ; users hover their computer mouse over the button , it spins and shows an emotion ( `` I 'm Feeling Puzzled '' or `` I 'm Feeling Trendy '' , for instance ) , and , when clicked , takes users to a Google service related to that emotion .
