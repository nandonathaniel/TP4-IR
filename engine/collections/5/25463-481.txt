The flagship station of the Packers Radio Network is Scripps Radio 's WTMJ in Milwaukee , which was the former flagship of the Journal Broadcast Group before its merger with Scripps in April 2015 . WTMJ has aired Packers games since 1929 , the longest association between a radio station and an NFL team to date , and the only rights deal in American professional sports where a station outside of the team 's main metro area is the radio flagship . While this might be unusual , the station can be heard at city - grade strength at all hours in Green Bay proper . Games air in Green Bay on WTAQ ( 1360 / 97.5 ) and WIXX - FM ( 101.1 ) , and WAPL ( 105.7 ) and WHBY ( 1150 ) in Appleton and the Fox Cities . Wayne Larrivee is the play - by - play announcer and Larry McCarren is the color analyst . Larrivee joined the team after many years as the Chicago Bears ' announcer . Jim Irwin and Max McGee were the longtime radio announcers before Larrivee and McCarren . When victory is assured for the Packers , either a game - winning touchdown , interception or a crucial 4th down defensive stop , Larrivee 's trademark declaration of `` And there is your dagger ! '' signifies the event . In limited circumstances where the Milwaukee Brewers are in either playoff or post-season contention and their play - by - play takes priority , WTMJ 's sister FM station WKTI ( 94.5 ) currently airs Packer games to avert game conflicts .
