A move to `` permanent daylight saving time '' ( staying on summer hours all year with no time shifts ) is sometimes advocated , and has in fact been implemented in some jurisdictions such as Argentina , Chile , Iceland , Singapore , Uzbekistan , Belarus , Turkey and Northern Cyprus . It could be a result of following the timezone of a neighbouring region , political will or other causes . Advocates cite the same advantages as normal DST without the problems associated with the twice yearly time shifts . However , many remain unconvinced of the benefits , citing the same problems and the relatively late sunrises , particularly in winter , that year - round DST entails .
