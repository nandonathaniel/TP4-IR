Riaz & Tanveer ( n.d ) wrote that Place refers to the availability of the product to the targeted customers . So a product or company does n't have to be close to where its customer base is but instead they just have to make their product as available as possible . This improves efficiency and therefore price can be dropped intern increasing sales and profit . For max profits a company 's distribution channels must be effective in enticing the customer .
