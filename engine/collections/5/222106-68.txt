One characteristic that was meant to better workplace conditions was his rule that `` Organization follows hierarchical principle -- subordinates follow orders or superiors , but have right of appeal ( in contrast to more diffuse structure in traditional authority ) '' ( Bureaucracy ( Weber ) ) . In other words , everyone in a company or any sort of work environment has the opportunity and right to disagree or to speak up if they are unhappy with something rather than not voice their opinion in fear of losing their job . Open communication is a very important part of Weber 's ideal bureaucracy , and is practiced today . Because of the communication it may not be the most efficient , but Weber would argue that improved human conditions are more important than efficiency .
