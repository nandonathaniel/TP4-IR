Since 1967 , the helmets of Ohio State players have been adorned with white decals approximately the size of a quarter depicting a buckeye leaf , awarded for making significant plays and for consistency of performance . In the 1970s , the decals were approximately the size of a Silver Dollar until the 1979 Season . Most believe that this practice began in 1968 when the Buckeyes switched to their present Silver Helmet design since the decals have become identified with that helmet .
