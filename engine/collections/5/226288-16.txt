The uterus contains three suspensory ligaments that help stabilize the position of the uterus and limits its range of movement . The uterosacral ligaments keep the body from moving inferiorly and anteriorly . The round ligaments restrict posterior movement of the uterus . The cardinal ligaments also prevent the inferior movement of the uterus .
