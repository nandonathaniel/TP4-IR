In 1840 , the Adelaide City Council and the Sydney City Council were established . Men who possessed 1,000 pounds worth of property were able to stand for election and wealthy landowners were permitted up to four votes each in elections . Australia 's first parliamentary elections were conducted for the New South Wales Legislative Council in 1843 , again with voting rights ( for males only ) tied to property ownership or financial capacity . Voter rights were extended further in New South Wales in 1850 and elections for legislative councils were held in the colonies of Victoria , South Australia and Tasmania .
