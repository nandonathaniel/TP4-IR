In 1996 , the Eagles donned new uniforms featuring a darker shade of green . They got off to a good start , winning three of their first four games . However , a week - 5 Monday night game at Veterans Stadium against the hated Cowboys would witness a season - ending knee injury to Peete and the loss of the team 's momentum , and the transition to an offense led by Ty Detmer and Watters . While Detmer played well and Watters rushed for 1,411 yards , the season followed an all - too - familiar pattern : 10 - 6 record , and early elimination ( a 14 - 0 shutout by the 49ers ) in the playoffs . The continued early playoff exits led to fans and local media blaming the high priced free agent signings ( Irving Fryar , Watters , Troy Vincent , and Guy McIntyre ) for not stepping up in big games , most notably the postseason . Rhodes gradually deteriorated under the stress of the job , and players were beginning to grow tired of his brash demeanor and often autocratic coaching style . After an up - and - down 6 - 9 - 1 campaign in 1997 , the bottom fell out in 1998 . The Eagles suffered a 3 - 13 record -- the worst in franchise history . They were ranked dead last in numerous offensive statistics . Home game attendance was declining , a quarterback controversy was deteriorating an already rudderless locker room , and the players had all but tuned out the embattled coaching staff . Left with little choice after a disastrous season , fan revolt and sagging team morale , Lurie fired Rhodes .
