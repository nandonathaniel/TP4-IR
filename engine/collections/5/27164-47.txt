God 's passive will involves him allowing , rather than causing , something to happen . Chapter 1 of the book of Job illustrates this in what God allowed Satan to do in the life of Job . It is also involved in the evil that God allowed Joseph 's brothers to do to Joseph in order to accomplish a greater good , a good not apparent to Joseph until years later ( Genesis 50 : 20 ) .
