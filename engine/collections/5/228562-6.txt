In most games , trump cards can not be played if the player has any cards of the suit led to the trick ; the requirement to `` follow suit '' is of higher priority . In a few games , trumps can be played at any time . Playing the first trump to an already - started trick is known as trumping or ruffing ; if another player were to play a higher trump , that would be an overruff or overtrump .
