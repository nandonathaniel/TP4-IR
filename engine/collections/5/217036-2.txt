Explosive eruptions produce a mixture of volcanic ash and other fragments called tephra , rather than lava flows . The word lava comes from Italian , and is probably derived from the Latin word labes which means a fall or slide . The first use in connection with extruded magma ( molten rock below the Earth 's surface ) was apparently in a short account written by Francesco Serao on the eruption of Vesuvius between May 14 and June 4 , 1737 . Serao described `` a flow of fiery lava '' as an analogy to the flow of water and mud down the flanks of the volcano following heavy rain .
