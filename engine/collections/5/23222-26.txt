Burial at sea was a method hypothetically suggested by the then Medical Officer of Health for Liverpool , Dr Duncan Dolton , in which unburied bodies could be buried at sea during any extended strike by gravediggers union the GMWU during the Winter of Discontent . The suggestion caused great alarm amongst the public and helped prompt a resolution to the strike . British colonial burials at sea of the 18th and 19th century involved wrapping the deceased in sail cloth weighted with cannonballs .
