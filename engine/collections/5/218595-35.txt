He achieved one more major success with the 1991 ballad `` Cry for Help '' , which reached No 7 in both the UK and the US . The other two singles from Free were not as successful . `` Move Right Out '' reached No 58 in the UK and No 81 in the US ; and `` Never Knew Love '' reached No 70 in the UK and did not chart in the US . Free would mark the end of Astley 's successful period , and `` Cry for Help '' would be the last Astley single to make the Top 10 in either the UK or US to date .
