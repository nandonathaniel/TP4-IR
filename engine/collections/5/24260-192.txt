Before Uthman canonized the Quran there were different versions or codices , none of which have been discovered to date . These codices never gained general approval and were viewed by Muslims as the personal copies of individuals . However , `` the search for variants in the partial versions extant before the Caliph Uthman 's alleged recension in the 640s has not yielded any differences of great significance '' . The two most influential at this time are ʿ Abdullah ibn Masʿud 's and Ubayy ibn Kaʿb 's codices . Al - Qurazi recounts seeing the Mushafs used by Ibn Mas'ud , Ubayy , and Zaid b . Thabit , and finding among them no differences .
