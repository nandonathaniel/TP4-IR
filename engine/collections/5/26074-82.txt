Laine wrote the lyrics for the title song on another 1958 album , Torchin ' , which was also his first recorded in stereo . He was backed by trombonist Frank Comstock 's orchestra , on a dozen classic torch songs including : `` A Cottage for Sale '' , `` I Cover the Waterfront '' , `` You 've Changed '' , `` These Foolish Things '' , `` I Got it Bad ( And That Ai n't Good ) '' , `` It 's the Talk of the Town '' , and `` Body and Soul '' . As with his Legrand album , he sings the entire lyric for each song .
