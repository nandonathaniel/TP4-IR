The crystal structure of the F showed alternating alpha and beta subunits ( 3 of each ) , arranged like segments of an orange around a rotating asymmetrical gamma subunit . According to the current model of ATP synthesis ( known as the alternating catalytic model ) , the transmembrane potential created by ( H+ ) proton cations supplied by the electron transport chain , drives the ( H+ ) proton cations from the intermembrane space through the membrane via the F region of ATP synthase . A portion of the F ( the ring of c - subunits ) rotates as the protons pass through the membrane . The c - ring is tightly attached to the asymmetric central stalk ( consisting primarily of the gamma subunit ) , causing it to rotate within the alpha beta of F causing the 3 catalytic nucleotide binding sites to go through a series of conformational changes that leads to ATP synthesis . The major F subunits are prevented from rotating in sympathy with the central stalk rotor by a peripheral stalk that joins the alpha beta to the non-rotating portion of F. The structure of the intact ATP synthase is currently known at low - resolution from electron cryo - microscopy ( cryo - EM ) studies of the complex . The cryo - EM model of ATP synthase suggests that the peripheral stalk is a flexible structure that wraps around the complex as it joins F to F. Under the right conditions , the enzyme reaction can also be carried out in reverse , with ATP hydrolysis driving proton pumping across the membrane .
