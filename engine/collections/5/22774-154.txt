In The Study of Ethnomusicology : Thirty - One Issues and Concepts , Nettl discusses personal and global issues pertaining to field researchers , particularly those from a Western academic background . In a chapter that recounts his field recordings among Native Americans of the northern plains , for instance , he attempts to come to terms with the problematic history of ethnographic fieldwork , and envision a future trajectory for the practice in the 21st century and beyond . Considering that ethnomusicology is a field that intersects in a vast array of other fields in the social sciences and beyond , it focuses on studying people , and it is appropriate to encounter the issue of `` making the unfamiliar , familiar , '' a phrase coined by William McDougall that is well known in social psychology . As in social psychology , the `` unfamiliar '' is encountered in three different ways during ethnomusicological work : 1 ) two different cultures come into contact and elements of both are not immediately explicable to the other ; 2 ) experts within a society produce new knowledge , which is then communicated to the public ; and 3 ) active minorities communicate their perspective to the majority .
