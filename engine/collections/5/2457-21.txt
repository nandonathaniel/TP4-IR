It seems that spirals were an important motif for the megalith builders ( see Megalithic Temples of Malta ) . They have been found carved into megalithic structures all over Europe , along with other symbols such as lozenges , eye - patterns , zigzags in various configurations , and cup and ring marks . While not a written script in the modern sense of the term , these symbols are considered to have conveyed meaning to their creators , and are remarkably consistent across the whole of Europe .
