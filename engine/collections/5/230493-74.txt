From the 1920s to the 1940s , Long Island began the transformation from backwoods and farms as developers created numerous suburbs . Numerous branches of the LIRR already enabled commuting from the suburbs to Manhattan . Robert Moses engineered various automobile parkway projects to span the island , and developed beaches and state parks for the enjoyment of residents and visitors from the city . Gradually , development also followed these parkways , with various communities springing up along the more traveled routes .
