In his 2017 art exhibition at the Serpentine Gallery in London , the artist Grayson Perry showed a series of ceramic , tapestry and other works of art dealing with the divisions in Britain during the Brexit campaign and in its aftermath . This included two large ceramic pots , Perry called his Brexit Vases , standing on plinths ten feet apart , on the first of which were scenes involving pro-European British citizens , and on the second scenes involving anti-European British citizens . These were derived from what Perry called his ' Brexit tour of Britain . '
