Vampire bats form strong bonds with other members of the colony . A related unique adaptation of vampire bats is the sharing of food . A vampire bat can only survive about two days without a meal of blood , yet they can not be guaranteed of finding food every night . This poses a problem , so when a bat fails to find food , it will often `` beg '' another bat for food . A `` donor '' bat may regurgitate a small amount of blood to sustain the other member of the colony . For equally familiar bats , the predictive capacity of reciprocity surpasses that of relatedness . This finding suggests that vampire bats are capable of preferentially aiding their relatives , but that they may benefit more from forming reciprocal , cooperative relationships with relatives and non-relatives alike . Furthermore , donor bats were more likely to approach starving bats and initiate the food sharing . These findings contradict the harassment hypothesis -- which claims that individuals share food in order to limit harassment by begging individuals . All considered , vampire bat research should be interpreted cautiously as much of the evidence is correlational and still requires further testing .
