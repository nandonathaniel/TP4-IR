As Northern Wei became more economically dependent on agriculture , the Xianbei emperors made a conscious decision to adopt Chinese customs , including passive methods of frontier defence . In 423 , a defence line over 2,000 li ( 1,080 kilometres ( 670 mi ) ) long was built to resist the Rouran ; its path roughly followed the old Zhao wall from Chicheng County in Hebei Province to Wuyuan County , Inner Mongolia . In 446 , 100,000 men were put to work building an inner wall from Yanqing , passing south of the Wei capital Pingcheng , and ending up near Pingguan on the eastern bank of the Yellow River . The two walls formed the basis of the double - layered Xuanfu -- Datong wall system that protected Beijing a thousand years later during the Ming dynasty .
