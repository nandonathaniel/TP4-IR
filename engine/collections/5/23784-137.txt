In a referendum on the future of the State of Vietnam on 23 October 1955 , Diệm rigged the poll supervised by his brother Ngô Đình Nhu and was credited with 98.2 percent of the vote , including 133 % in Saigon . His American advisors had recommended a more modest winning margin of `` 60 to 70 percent . '' Diệm , however , viewed the election as a test of authority . Three days later , he declared South Vietnam to be an independent state under the name Republic of Vietnam ( ROV ) , with himself as president . Likewise , Ho Chi Minh and other communist officials always won at least 99 % of the vote in North Vietnamese `` elections '' .
