While the animated TV series , which lasted for 10 seasons until 1996 , was more light - hearted , the comic - book series continued in a much darker and grittier tone . In 1990 , a live - action feature film was released , with the Turtles and Splinter being portrayed by actors in partially animatronic suits created by Jim Henson 's Creature Shop . The film became one of the most successful independent films and spawned two sequels , as well as inspiring a three - dimensional animated film set in the same continuity , which was released in 2007 under the title TMNT . After the end of the cartoon series , a live - action series in the vein of the films was created in 1997 in conjunction with Saban Entertainment . The series was called Ninja Turtles : The Next Mutation and introduced a fifth , female turtle called Venus de Milo . However , the series was largely unsuccessful and was canceled after one season .
