The Navy Department awakened to the possibilities of naval aviation through the efforts of Captain Washington Irving Chambers ; he prevailed upon Congress to include in the Naval Appropriation Act enacted in 1911 -- 12 a provision for aeronautical development . Chambers was ordered to devote all of his time to naval aviation . In October 1913 , Secretary of the Navy Josephus Daniels , appointed a board , with Captain Chambers as chairman , to make a survey of aeronautical needs and to establish a policy to guide future development . One of the board 's most important recommendations was the establishment of an aviation training station in Pensacola .
