A person may not sit in the Commons if he or she is the subject of a Bankruptcy Restrictions Order ( applicable in England and Wales only ) , or if he or she is adjudged bankrupt ( in Northern Ireland ) , or if his or her estate is sequestered ( in Scotland ) . Previously , MPs detained under the Mental Health Act 1983 for six months or more would have their seat vacated if two specialists reported to the Speaker that the member was suffering from a mental disorder . However , this disqualification was removed by the Mental Health ( Discrimination ) Act 2013 . There also exists a common law precedent from the 18th century that the `` deaf and dumb '' are ineligible to sit in the Lower House ; this precedent , however , has not been tested in recent years . Jack Ashley continued to serve as an MP for 25 years after becoming profoundly deaf .
