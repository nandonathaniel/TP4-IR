Perhaps the highlight of the Daffiness Boys era came after Wilbert Robinson left the dugout . In 1934 , Giants player / manager Bill Terry was asked about the Dodgers ' chances in the coming pennant race and cracked infamously , `` Is Brooklyn still in the league ? '' Managed then by Casey Stengel , who played for the Dodgers in the 1910s and went on to greatness managing the New York Yankees , the 1934 Dodgers were determined to make their presence felt . As it happened , the season entered its final games with the Giants tied with the St. Louis Cardinals for the pennant , with the Giants ' remaining games against the Dodgers . Stengel led his Bums to the Polo Grounds for the showdown , and they beat the Giants twice to knock them out of the pennant race . The `` Gashouse Gang '' Cardinals nailed the pennant by beating the Cincinnati Reds those same two days .
