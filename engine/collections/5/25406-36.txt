The relationship between Joel and Ellie was the central focus of the game ; all other elements were developed around it . Troy Baker and Ashley Johnson were cast as Joel and Ellie , respectively , and provided voice and motion capture performances . Baker and Johnson contributed to the development of the characters ; for example , Baker convinced Druckmann that Joel would care for Tess due to his loneliness , and Johnson convinced Druckmann that Ellie should be stronger and more defensive . Ellie 's physical appearance was also redesigned throughout development to make her look more similar to Johnson . The game 's other characters also underwent changes . The character Tess was originally intended to be the main antagonist of The Last of Us , but the team found it difficult to believe her motives . The sexuality of the character Bill was originally left vague in the script , but later altered to further reflect his homosexuality .
