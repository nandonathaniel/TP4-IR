The historical study of Cubism began in the late 1920s , drawing at first from sources of limited data , namely the opinions of Guillaume Apollinaire . It came to rely heavily on Daniel - Henry Kahnweiler 's book Der Weg zum Kubismus ( published in 1920 ) , which centered on the developments of Picasso , Braque , LÃ©ger , and Gris . The terms `` analytical '' and `` synthetic '' which subsequently emerged have been widely accepted since the mid-1930s . Both terms are historical impositions that occurred after the facts they identify . Neither phase was designated as such at the time corresponding works were created . `` If Kahnweiler considers Cubism as Picasso and Braque , '' wrote Daniel Robbins , `` our only fault is in subjecting other Cubists ' works to the rigors of that limited definition .
