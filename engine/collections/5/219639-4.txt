As such , the only hypothesis that needs to be specified in this test and which embodies the counter-claim is referred to as the null hypothesis ( that is , the hypothesis to be nullified ) . A result is said to be statistically significant if it allows us to reject the null hypothesis . That is , as per the reductio ad absurdum reasoning , the statistically significant result should be highly improbable if the null hypothesis is assumed to be true . The rejection of the null hypothesis implies that the correct hypothesis lies in the logical complement of the null hypothesis . However , unless there is a single alternative to the null hypothesis , the rejection of null hypothesis does not tell us which of the alternatives might be the correct one .
