The blood sugar level , blood sugar concentration , or blood glucose level is the amount of glucose present in the blood of humans and other animals . Glucose is a simple sugar and approximately 4 grams of glucose are present in the blood of humans at all times . The body tightly regulates blood glucose levels as a part of metabolic homeostasis . Glucose is stored in skeletal muscle and liver cells in the form of glycogen ; in fasted individuals , blood glucose is maintained at a constant level at the expense of glycogen stores in the liver and skeletal muscle .
