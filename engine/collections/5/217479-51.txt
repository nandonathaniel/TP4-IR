The Polynesian people are considered to be by linguistic , archaeological and human genetic ancestry a subset of the sea - migrating Austronesian people and tracing Polynesian languages places their prehistoric origins in the Malay Archipelago , and ultimately , in Taiwan . Between about 3000 and 1000 BC speakers of Austronesian languages began spreading from Taiwan into Island South - East Asia , as tribes whose natives were thought to have arrived through South China about 8,000 years ago to the edges of western Micronesia and on into Melanesia .
