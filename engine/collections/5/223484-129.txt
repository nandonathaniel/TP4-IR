The `` extended alternative fiscal scenario '' assumes the continuation of present trends , which result in a more unfavorable debt position and adverse economic consequences relative to the baseline scenario . CBO reported in July 2014 that under this scenario : `` ( C ) ertain policies that are now in place but are scheduled to change under current law are assumed to continue , and some provisions of current law that might be difficult to sustain for a long period are assumed to be modified . Under that scenario , deficits excluding interest payments would be about $2 trillion larger over the first decade than those under the baseline ; subsequently , such deficits would be larger than those under the extended baseline by rapidly increasing amounts , doubling as a percentage of GDP in less than 10 years . CBO projects that real GNP in 2039 would be about 5 percent lower under the extended alternative fiscal scenario than under the extended baseline with economic feedback , and that interest rates would be about three - quarters of a percentage point higher . Reflecting the budgetary effects of those economic developments , federal debt would rise to 183 percent of GDP in 2039 . ''
