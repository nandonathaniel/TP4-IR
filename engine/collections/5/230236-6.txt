Clays exhibit plasticity when mixed with water in certain proportions . However , when dry , clay becomes firm and when fired in a kiln , permanent physical and chemical changes occur . These changes convert the clay into a ceramic material . Because of these properties , clay is used for making pottery , both utilitarian and decorative , and construction products , such as bricks , wall and floor tiles . Different types of clay , when used with different minerals and firing conditions , are used to produce earthenware , stoneware , and porcelain . Prehistoric humans discovered the useful properties of clay . Some of the earliest pottery shards recovered are from central Honshu , Japan . They are associated with the Jomon culture and deposits they were recovered from have been dated to around 14,000 BC .
