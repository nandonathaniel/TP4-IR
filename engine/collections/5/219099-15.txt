Histologically , tendons consist of dense regular connective tissue fascicles encased in dense irregular connective tissue sheaths . Normal healthy tendons are composed mostly of parallel arrays of collagen fibers closely packed together . They are anchored to bone by Sharpey 's fibres . The dry mass of normal tendons , which makes up about 30 % of their total mass , is composed of about 86 % collagen , 2 % elastin , 1 -- 5 % proteoglycans , and 0.2 % inorganic components such as copper , manganese , and calcium . The collagen portion is made up of 97 -- 98 % type I collagen , with small amounts of other types of collagen . These include type II collagen in the cartilaginous zones , type III collagen in the reticulin fibres of the vascular walls , type IX collagen , type IV collagen in the basement membranes of the capillaries , type V collagen in the vascular walls , and type X collagen in the mineralized fibrocartilage near the interface with the bone .
