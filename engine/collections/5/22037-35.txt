Although jazz is considered difficult to define , in part because it contains many subgenres , improvisation is one of its key elements . The centrality of improvisation is attributed to the influence of earlier forms of music such as blues , a form of folk music which arose in part from the work songs and field hollers of African - American slaves on plantations . These work songs were commonly structured around a repetitive call - and - response pattern , but early blues was also improvisational . Classical music performance is evaluated more by its fidelity to the musical score , with less attention given to interpretation , ornamentation , and accompaniment . The classical performer 's goal is to play the composition as it was written . In contrast , jazz is often characterized by the product of interaction and collaboration , placing less value on the contribution of the composer , if there is one , and more on the performer . The jazz performer interprets a tune in individual ways , never playing the same composition twice . Depending on the performer 's mood , experience , and interaction with band members or audience members , the performer may change melodies , harmonies , and time signatures .
