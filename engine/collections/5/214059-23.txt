In the show , Henson began experimenting with techniques that changed the way in which puppetry was used on television , including using the frame defined by the camera shot to allow the puppet performer to work from off - camera . He believed that television puppets needed to have `` life and sensitivity '' and began making characters from flexible , fabric - covered foam rubber , allowing them to express a wider array of emotions at a time when many puppets were made of carved wood . A marionette 's arms are manipulated by strings , but Henson used rods to move his Muppets ' arms , allowing greater control of expression . Additionally , he wanted the Muppet characters to `` speak '' more creatively than was possible for previous puppets , which had random mouth movements , so he used precise mouth movements to match the dialogue .
