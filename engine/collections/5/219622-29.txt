These changes can be attributed to Robert McNamara , who was appointed to the presidency in 1968 by Lyndon B. Johnson . McNamara implored bank treasurer Eugene Rotberg to seek out new sources of capital outside of the northern banks that had been the primary sources of funding . Rotberg used the global bond market to increase the capital available to the bank . One consequence of the period of poverty alleviation lending was the rapid rise of third world debt . From 1976 to 1980 developing world debt rose at an average annual rate of 20 % .
