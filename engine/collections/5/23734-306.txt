In the Cambodian Civil War , Khmer Rouge insurgents reportedly committed atrocities during the war . These include the murder of civilians and POWs by slowly sawing off their heads a little more each day , the destruction of Buddhist wats and the killing of monks , attacks on refugee camps involving the deliberate murder of babies and bomb threats against foreign aid workers , the abduction and assassination of journalists , and the shelling of Phnom Penh for more than a year . Journalist accounts stated that the Khmer Rouge shelling `` tortured the capital almost continuously '' , inflicting `` random death and mutilation '' on 2 million trapped civilians .
