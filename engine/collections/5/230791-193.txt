US Import Valuation Overcounts China : there has been a shift of low - end assembly industries to mainland China from newly industrialized countries in Asia . Mainland China has increasingly become the last link in a long chain of value - added production . Because US trade data attributes the full value of a product to the final assembler , mainland Chinese value added is overcounted . US demand for labor - intensive goods exceeds domestic output : the PRC has restrictive trade practices in mainland China , which include a wide array of barriers to foreign goods and services , often aimed at protecting state - owned enterprises . These practices include high tariffs , lack of transparency , requiring firms to obtain special permission to import goods , inconsistent application of laws and regulations , and leveraging technology from foreign firms in return for market access . Mainland China 's accession to the World Trade Organization is meant to help address these barriers . The undervaluation of the Renminbi relative to the United States dollar .
