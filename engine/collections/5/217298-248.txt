After gaining independence from Britain , India adopted a broadly socialist - inspired approach to economic growth . Like other countries with a democratic transition to a mixed economy , it did not abolish private property in capital . India proceeded by nationalizing various large privately run firms , creating state - owned enterprises and redistributing income through progressive taxation in a manner similar to social democratic Western European nations than to planned economies such as the Soviet Union or China . Today , India is often characterized as having a free - market economy that combines economic planning with the free - market . It did however adopt a very firm focus on national planning with a series of broad Five - Year Plans .
