Around the same time , Albrecht Dürer made his two trips to Italy , where he was greatly admired for his prints . Dürer , in turn , was influenced by the art he saw there . Other notable painters , such as Hans Holbein the Elder and Jean Fouquet , retained a Gothic influence that was still popular in the north , while highly individualistic artists such as Hieronymus Bosch and Pieter Bruegel the Elder developed styles that were imitated by many subsequent generations . Northern painters in the 16th century increasingly looked and travelled to Rome , becoming known as the Romanists . The High Renaissance art of Michelangelo and Raphael and the late Renaissance stylistic tendencies of Mannerism that were in vogue had a great impact on their work .
