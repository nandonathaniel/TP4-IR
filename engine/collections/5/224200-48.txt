The album cover is a picture titled `` Untitled # 44 '' from Nicholas Prior 's `` Age of Man '' collection which the band saw at an art show in New York City . The outside of the cardboard case contains no song listings , and does n't contain the name of the album or the band name anywhere but on the spine . The record company instead placed stickers on the plastic wrapping to indicate the name of the album and band , and on the UK version to indicate that it had the bonus track .
