Early on 31 March 1997 Channel 5 , which had begun broadcasting at 18 : 00 the previous evening , began a full run of Prisoner while later episodes were still appearing in many ITV regions . Except for an airing of the fire episode ( 326 ) , as part of a 1995 Channel 4 soap weekend , it was the series ' first UK network broadcast and gave some areas their first full run of the series . Although the schedule varied during the Channel 5 run , episodes were typically shown about five times a week in the 04 : 40 slot . It briefly moved to a late - night slot , usually around 23 : 30 , before returning to the 04 : 40 slot . The Channel 5 run ended on 11 February 2001 , with a double bill of the penultimate and final episodes . Channel 5 have no plans to re-run the series , despite viewer requests . For most of the Channel 5 run the programme was sponsored by Pot Noodle , with humorous Prisoner-esque sequences ( set in a prison cell and playing on the series ' wobbly scenery and props ) played before and after the episodes and in the leads into and out of commercial breaks .
