In a 1970 review of memory research , Tulving and Madigan concluded that advances in the study of memory might require the experimental investigation of `` one of the truly unique characteristics of human memory : its knowledge of its own knowledge '' . It was around the same time that John H. Flavell coined the term `` metamemory '' in a discussion on the development of memory . Since then , numerous metamemory phenomena have been studied , including judgments of learning , feelings of knowing , knowing that you do n't know , and know vs. remember .
