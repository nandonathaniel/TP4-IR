One of the first groups of atomists in England was a cadre of amateur scientists known as the Northumberland circle , led by Henry Percy , 9th Earl of Northumberland ( 1564 -- 1632 ) . Although they published little of account , they helped to disseminate atomistic ideas among the burgeoning scientific culture of England , and may have been particularly influential to Francis Bacon , who became an atomist around 1605 , though he later rejected some of the claims of atomism . Though they revived the classical form of atomism , this group was among the scientific avant - garde : the Northumberland circle contained nearly half of the confirmed Copernicans prior to 1610 ( the year of Galileo 's The Starry Messenger ) . Other influential atomists of late 16th and early 17th centuries include Giordano Bruno , Thomas Hobbes ( who also changed his stance on atomism late in his career ) , and Thomas Hariot . A number of different atomistic theories were blossoming in France at this time , as well ( Clericuzio 2000 ) .
