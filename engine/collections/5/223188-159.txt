Before the late 12th century the Bhagirathi - Hooghly distributary was the main channel of the Ganges and the Padma was only a minor spill - channel . The main flow of the river reached the sea not via the modern Hooghly River but rather by the Adi Ganga . Between the 12th and 16th centuries the Bhagirathi - Hooghly and Padma channels were more or less equally significant . After the 16th century the Padma grew to become the main channel of the Ganges . It is thought that the Bhagirathi - Hooghly became increasingly choked with silt , causing the main flow of the Ganges to shift to the southeast and the Padma River . By the end of the 18th century the Padma had become the main distributary of the Ganges . One result of this shift to the Padma was that the Ganges joined the Meghna and Brahmaputra rivers before emptying into the Bay of Bengal , together instead of separately . The present confluence of the Ganges and Meghna formed about 150 years ago .
