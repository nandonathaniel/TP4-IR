Goscinny and Tabary occasionally make appearances themselves . In one episode , Tabary uses a magical time - travelling closet to help Iznogoud seize the Caliph title . In another episode , Iznogoud gets a magical calendar that lets him travel in time when he rips off its pages . He rips too many and he is transported to the 20th century , inside the studio of Tabary . In another episode , Iznogoud gets a magical drawing paper set that makes anybody or anything drawn on it disappear once the paper is torn apart . Unfortunately , the drawing needs to be realistic , and Iznogoud is a poor artist . In search of an art teacher , he meets Tabary , renamed `` Tabary El - Retard '' .
