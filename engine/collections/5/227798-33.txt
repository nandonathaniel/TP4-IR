Some do not support the idea of voters being compelled to vote for candidates they have no interest in or knowledge of . Others may be well - informed , but have no preference for any particular candidate , or may have no wish to give support to the incumbent political system . In compulsory voting areas , such people often vote at random simply to fulfill legal requirements : the so - called donkey vote may account for sufficient percentage which has the potential to change the result in close races . ( Robson rotation can be used to distribute the donkey vote equally among all candidates , however . ) Similarly , citizens may vote with a complete absence of knowledge of any of the candidates or deliberately skew their ballot to slow the polling process and disrupt the election , or vote for frivolous or jokey candidates . Such arguments are frequently aired in Brazil , where opposition to compulsory voting has increased from 43 % in 2008 to 61 % in 2014 and where two out of ten voters have abstained from voting in recent elections .
