Derryl MacLein , a professor of social history and Islamic studies , states that historical evidence does not support this theory , whatever evidence is available suggests that Muslim institutions in north - west India legitimised and continued any inequalities that existed , and that neither Buddhists nor `` lower caste '' Hindus converted to Islam because they viewed Islam to lack a caste system . Conversions to Islam were rare , states MacLein , and conversions attested by historical evidence confirms that the few who did convert were Brahmin Hindus ( theoretically , the upper caste ) . MacLein states the caste and conversion theories about Indian society during the Islamic era are not based on historical evidence or verifiable sources , but personal assumptions of Muslim historians about the nature of Islam , Hinduism and Buddhism in northwest Indian subcontinent .
