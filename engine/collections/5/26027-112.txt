Young Richard attended East Whittier Elementary School , where he was president of his eighth - grade class . His parents believed that attending Whittier High School had caused Richard 's older brother Harold to live a dissolute lifestyle before he fell ill of tuberculosis ( he died of the disease in 1933 ) , and so they sent Richard to the larger Fullerton Union High School . He had to ride a school bus for an hour each way during his freshman year , and he received excellent grades . Later , he lived with an aunt in Fullerton during the week . He played junior varsity football , and seldom missed a practice , even though he was rarely used in games . He had greater success as a debater , winning a number of championships and taking his only formal tutelage in public speaking from Fullerton 's Head of English , H. Lynn Sheller . Nixon later remembered Sheller 's words , `` Remember , speaking is conversation ... do n't shout at people . Talk to them . Converse with them . '' Nixon stated that he tried to use the conversational tone as much as possible .
