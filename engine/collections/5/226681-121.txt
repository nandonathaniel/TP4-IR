In the past , Traditional Chinese was most often rendered using the Big5 character encoding scheme , a scheme that favors Traditional Chinese . Unicode , however , has become increasingly popular as a rendering method . Unicode gives equal weight to both simplified and traditional Chinese characters . There are various IMEs ( Input Method Editors ) available to input Chinese characters . There are still many Unicode characters that can not be written using most IMEs ; one example would be the character used in the Shanghainese dialect instead of 嗎 , which is U + 20C8E 𠲎 ( 伐 with a 口 radical ) .
