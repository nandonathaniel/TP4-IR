Bosou , also called noonsom or tonsom , is the Kadazandusun term for a traditional recipe of tangy fermented meat . Smoked and pulverised buah keluak ( nuts from the Kepayang tree ( Pangium edule ) which grows in Malaysia 's mangrove swamplands ) , or pangi is a key ingredient and acts as a preservative . Combined with rice , salt and fresh meat or fish , the mixture is then placed into a sealed jar or container for fermentation . Contemporary variants for bosou add bananas and pineapples to the mixture . Pinongian is a variant where rice is omitted to produce a final product which is much less tangy in taste ; however , unlike bosou , `` pinongian '' must be cooked before serving .
