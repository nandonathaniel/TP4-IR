Scholars in different disciplines have developed more than 100 different theories of acculturation , but the concept of acculturation has only been studied scientifically since 1918 . As it has been approached at different times from the fields of psychology , anthropology , and sociology , numerous theories and definitions have emerged to describe elements of the acculturative process . Despite definitions and evidence that acculturation entails a two - way process of change , research and theory have primarily focused on the adjustments and adaptations made by minorities such as immigrants , refugees , and indigenous peoples in response to their contact with the dominant majority . Contemporary research has primarily focused on different strategies of acculturation , how variations in acculturation affect individuals , and interventions to make this process easier .
