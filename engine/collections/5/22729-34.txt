As early as 1760 there were people already settled in Patillas however it was not a permanent settlement . During the mid-18th century there were a lot of people already living in Patillas . Patillas is along the southeastern coast of the island of Puerto Rico . During this time frame , there was an establishment of a sugar cane mill which took advantage of the agricultural potential the valley provided . As this establishment provided a good source of income for the neighbors it also was the main reason for the town 's foundation in 1811 . Doña Adelina Cintrón , owner of `` La Finca Patillas '' , donated almost 8 acres ( 32,000 m ) of land for the foundation . Most of the neighbors then relocated towards the west side of the proposed site called Cacao Bajo .
