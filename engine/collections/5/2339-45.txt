The song has been played at Fenway Park , home of Major League Baseball 's Boston Red Sox , since at least 1997 , and in the middle of the eighth inning at every game since 2002 . On opening night of the 2010 season at Fenway Park , the song was performed by Diamond himself . `` Sweet Caroline '' was played at Penn State Nittany Lions football games at Beaver Stadium until August 2012 , halting after the Penn State child sex abuse scandal . Performances at Beaver Stadium resumed in September 2013 , however . The song is played at the start of the fourth quarter of Pittsburgh Panthers Football games at Heinz Field . In response , West Virginia University students and fans will yell `` eat shit , Pitt '' during the refrain if heard played . It is also an unofficial song of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill , being played at athletic events and pep rallies .
