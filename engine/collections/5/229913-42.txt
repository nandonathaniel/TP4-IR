In the fall of 2006 , the Element and Friends ( https://web.archive.org/web/20080828161538/http://elementandfriends.com/ website , now defunct ) was re-launched with the introduction of the new Element SC trim . The previous version had the driving game using the Element EX-P ( now simply called the EX ) in a desert , snow topped mountains , forests , and a beach . They now renamed that area `` above ground '' . A new second option from the main page allows you to select the Element SC to go `` underground '' in an urbanesque environment featuring a drive - in , central park with a basketball court , a seedy mainstreet , and project housing . The six new SC friends include a rat , mole , hamster , pigeon , roach , and a dog . The drive - in serves as the venue to view the TV spots that feature only the rat , mole , pigeon , and hamster . The format remains the same with new mini-games , but both maps now include a tunnel to venture above or below the surface , through the mountain and building respectively . Changes to the above ground include the removal of the previous TV spots from the website and a link on the beach to Gil 's Myspace page .
