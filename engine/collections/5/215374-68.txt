The economic development of the border region on the Mexican side of the border depended largely on its proximity to the United States , due to its remoteness from commercial centers in Mexico . During the years of Mexican President Porfirio DÃ­az , between 1876 and 1910 , the border communities boomed , due mostly to close ties to the United States , and the Mexican government 's support for financial investments from the United States . Railroads were built that connected the northern Mexican states more to the United States than to Mexico and the population grew tremendously . The mining industry also developed , as did the United States ' control of it . By the early 20th century companies from the United States controlled 81 % of the mining industry and had invested five hundred million dollars in the Mexican economy overall , twenty - five percent of it in the border regions .
