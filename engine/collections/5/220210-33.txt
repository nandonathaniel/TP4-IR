With the election of Ulysses S. Grant in 1868 , the Radicals had control of Congress , the party and the army and attempted to build a solid Republican base in the South using the votes of Freedmen , Scalawags and Carpetbaggers , supported directly by U.S. Army detachments . Republicans all across the South formed local clubs called Union Leagues that effectively mobilized the voters , discussed issues and when necessary fought off Ku Klux Klan ( KKK ) attacks . Thousands died on both sides .
