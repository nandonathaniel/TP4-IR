According to historian Jane Dailey from University of Chicago , in many cases the purpose of the monuments was not to celebrate the past but rather to promote a `` white supremacist future '' . Another historian , Karyn Cox , from University of North Carolina has written that the monuments are `` a legacy of the brutally racist Jim Crow era '' . Another historian from UNC , James Leloudis , stated that `` The funders and backers of these monuments are very explicit that they are requiring a political education and a legitimacy for the Jim Crow era and the right of white men to rule .
