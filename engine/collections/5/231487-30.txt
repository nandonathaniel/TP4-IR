A further source of provocation was an Athenian decree , issued in 433 / 2 BC , imposing stringent trade sanctions on Megarian citizens ( once more a Spartan ally after the conclusion of the First Peloponnesian War ) . It was alleged that the Megarians had desecrated the Hiera Orgas . These sanctions , known as the Megarian decree , were largely ignored by Thucydides , but some modern economic historians have noted that forbidding Megara to trade with the prosperous Athenian empire would have been disastrous for the Megarans , and have accordingly considered the decree to be a contributing factor in bringing about the war . Historians that attribute responsibility for the war to Athens cite this event as the main cause for blame .
