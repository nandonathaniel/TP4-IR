The first sketch of `` El Chavo del Ocho '' was broadcast on 20 June 1971 , after Rubén Aguirre , who played `` Profesor Jirafales '' in El Chavo from 1973 onwards , had left the program `` Los Supergenios '' to host a show in another TV channel . With the departure of Rubén Aguirre , one of the sketches named `` Los Chifladitos '' would end , with `` El Chavo del Ocho '' taking its place .
