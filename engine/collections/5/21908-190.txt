There are two variants of ARMD , ARMD - FDD and ARMD - HDD . Originally ARMD caused the devices to appear as a sort of very large floppy drive , either the primary floppy drive device 00h or the secondary device 01h . Some operating systems required code changes to support floppy disks with capacities far larger than any standard floppy disk drive . Also , standard - floppy disk drive emulation proved to be unsuitable for certain high - capacity floppy disk drives such as Iomega Zip drives . Later the ARMD - HDD , ARMD - `` Hard disk device '' , variant was developed to address these issues . Under ARMD - HDD , an ARMD device appears to the BIOS and the operating system as a hard drive .
