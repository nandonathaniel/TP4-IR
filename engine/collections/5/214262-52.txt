This phenomenon can best be described using the vocabulary of abstract algebra . The congruence classes relatively prime to the modulus are a group under multiplication , called the group of units of the ring Z / nZ , and the squares are a subgroup of it . Different nonresidues may belong to different cosets , and there is no simple rule that predicts which one their product will be in . Modulo a prime , there is only the subgroup of squares and a single coset .
