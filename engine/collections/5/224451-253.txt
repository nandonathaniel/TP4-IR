Ghulams : Tahmasp I had started introducing huge amounts of Georgian , Circassian and Armenian slaves and deportees from the Caucasus , of whom a sizeable amount would become part of the future ghulam system . Shah Abbas expanded this program significantly and fully implemented it , and eventually created a force of 15,000 ghulam cavalrymen and 3,000 ghulam royal bodyguards . With the advent of the brother 's Shirley at Abbas ' court and by the efforts of statesman Allahverdi Khan , from 1600 onwards , the ghulam fighting regiments were further dramatically expanded under Abbas reaching 25,000 . Under Abbas , this force amounted to a total of near 40,000 soldiers paid for and beholden to the Shah . They would become the elite soldiers of the Safavid armies ( like the Ottoman Jannisary ) .
