Conducting is the art of directing a musical performance , such as an orchestral or choral concert . It has been defined as `` the art of directing the simultaneous performance of several players or singers by the use of gesture . '' The primary duties of the conductor are to interpret the score created by a composer in a manner which is reflective of the specific indications within that score , set the tempo , ensure correct entries by various members of the ensemble , and to `` shape '' the phrasing where appropriate . To convey their ideas and interpretation , conductors communicate with their musicians primarily through hand gestures , typically though not invariably with the aid of a baton , and may use other gestures or signals , such as eye contact with relevant performers . A conductor 's directions will almost invariably be supplemented or reinforced by verbal instructions or suggestions to their musicians in rehearsal prior to a performance .
