Time was not standardized across the United States until about 1883 . In 1865 , each railroad set its own time to minimize scheduling errors . To communicate easily up and down the line , the railroads built telegraph lines alongside the railroad . These lines eventually superseded the original First Transcontinental Telegraph which followed much of the Mormon Trail up the North Platte River and across the very thinly populated Central Nevada Route through central Utah and Nevada . The telegraph lines along the railroad were easier to protect and maintain . Many of the original telegraph lines were abandoned as the telegraph business was consolidated with the railroad telegraph lines .
