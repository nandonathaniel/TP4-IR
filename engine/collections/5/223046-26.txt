Mario Kart Wii features multiple game modes : Grand Prix , Time Trials , Versus , and Battle . All modes support single - player gameplay ; Versus and Battle support local multiplayer for up to four players , with or without computer - controlled players . In Grand Prix , the player participates in four three - lap races from one of the eight selectable cups against eleven opponents . The player is awarded points at the end of each race based on their ranking . The total number of points collected determines the player 's overall rank . Versus mode is similar to Grand Prix , but the presented courses and items may be configurable . In Time Trials , the player must quickly complete the race in the fastest time possible -- there are no opponents or items except for three Mushrooms given at the start of each race . The player can compete against a ghost character , which mimics a player 's movements from an earlier race . Ghost data can be saved in the Wii console memory .
