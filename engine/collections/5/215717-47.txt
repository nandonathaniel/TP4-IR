From the post-WWII years until the AIDS epidemic , the neighborhood , especially below 86th Street , had a substantial gay population . As the neighborhood had deteriorated , it was affordable to working class gay men , and those just arriving in the city and looking for their first white collar jobs . Its ethnically mixed gay population , mostly Hispanic and white , with a mixture of income levels and occupations patronized the same gay bars in the neighborhood , making it markedly different from most gay enclaves elsewhere in the city . The influx of white gay men in the Fifties and Sixties is often credited with accelerating the gentrification of the Upper West Side .
