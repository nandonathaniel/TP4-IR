Brandeis University , the only nonsectarian Jewish - sponsored college university in the world , created the Transitional Year Program ( TYP ) in 1968 , in part response to Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King 's assassination . The faculty created it to renew the university 's commitment to social justice . Recognizing Brandeis as a university with a commitment to academic excellence , these faculty members created a chance to disadvantaged students to participate in an empowering educational experience .
