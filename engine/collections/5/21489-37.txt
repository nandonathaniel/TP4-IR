In 2009 , under new coach Daniel Anderson , the Eels had an indifferent start to the season which saw the release of star halfback Brett Finch . After 18 rounds and incredibly inconsistent form , the Parramatta Eels had won only 5 games and were sitting third - last and were in direct contention for the dreaded 2009 NRL Wooden Spoon . TAB SportsBet had the Eels as $151 outsiders to win the NRL Premiership .
