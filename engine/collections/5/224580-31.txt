The whole of Sicily was now in Roman hands , except for Agrigentum , which held out until 210 BC , when it was betrayed by Numidian mercenaries . In the summer , the time came to hold the comitia centuriata at Rome , in order to elect the consuls . The task of organising the elections was expected to fall to Marcellus as senior consul , but he sent a letter to the Senate when it recalled him , declaring that it would be harmful to the Republic to leave Hannibal to his own devices . When the Senate received this , there was debate as to whether it was better to recall the consul from campaign even though he was unwilling or to cancel the elections of consuls for 209 BC . In the end it was decided to recall Valerius Laevinus from Sicily , even though he was outside Italy . The senate ordered the Urban praetor , Lucius Manlius Acidinus to take a letter to Valerius , along with that sent to the Senate by Marcellus , and to explain to him why they had decided to recall him .
