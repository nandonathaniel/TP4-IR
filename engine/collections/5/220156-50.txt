In March 2016 , the United States Fish and Wildlife Service issued a sovereign lands construction permit . In late May 2016 , the permit was temporarily revoked in three counties of Iowa , where the pipeline would cross the Big Sioux River and the Big Sioux Wildlife Management Area ; these are historic and cultural sites of the Upper Sioux tribe , including graves in Lyon County . Also in May 2016 , Iowa farmers filed lawsuits to prevent the state from using eminent domain to take their land .
