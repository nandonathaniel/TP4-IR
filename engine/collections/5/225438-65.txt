Blood pressure and heart rate are influenced by the vasomotor centre of the medulla , which causes arteries and veins to be somewhat constricted at rest . It does this by influencing the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems via the vagus nerve . Information about blood pressure is generated by baroreceptors in aortic bodies in the aortic arch , and passed to the brain along the afferent fibres of the vagus nerve . Information about the pressure changes in the carotid sinus comes from carotid bodies located near the carotid artery and this is passed via a nerve joining with the glossopharyngeal nerve . This information travels up to the solitary nucleus in the medulla . Signals from here influence the vasomotor centre to adjust vein and artery constriction accordingly .
