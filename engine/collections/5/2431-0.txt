In medicine and pharmacology , a trough level or trough concentration is the lowest concentration reached by a drug before the next dose is administered , often used in therapeutic drug monitoring . The name comes from the idea that on a graph of concentration versus time , the line forms a U-shaped trough at the lowest region , before a new dose sends it higher again . The usual criterion is concentration in the blood serum , although in some instances local concentration within tissues is relevant . It is pharmacokinetically normal that with every passing minute and hour , the drug molecules are being metabolized or cleared by the body , so the concentration of drug that remains available is dropping . In a medicine that is administered periodically , the trough level should be measured just before the administration of the next dose in order to avoid overdosing . A trough level is contrasted with a `` peak level '' , which is the highest level of the medicine in the body , and the `` average level '' , which is the mean level over time . It helps in therapeutic drug monitoring . It is widely used in clinical trials for newer medicines for its therapeutic effectiveness and safety .
