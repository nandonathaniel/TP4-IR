The Convention was drafted by the Council of Europe after World War II . Sir David Maxwell - Fyfe was the Chair of the Committee on Legal and Administrative Questions of the Council 's Consultative Assembly from 1949 to 1952 , and oversaw the drafting of the European Convention on Human Rights . It was designed to incorporate a traditional civil liberties approach to securing `` effective political democracy '' , from the strong traditions of freedom and liberty in the United Kingdom . As a founding member of the Council of Europe , the UK acceded to the European Convention on Human Rights in March 1951 . However it was not until the 1960s that British citizens were able to bring claims in the European Court of Human Rights ( ECtHR ) . During the 1980s , groups such as Charter 88 ( which invoked the 300th anniversary of the Glorious Revolution in 1688 and the Bill of Rights 1689 ) accused the executive of misusing its power and argued that a new British Bill of Rights was needed to secure human rights in the UK .
