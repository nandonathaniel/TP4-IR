The amount of gravitational potential energy possessed by an elevated object is equal to the work done against gravity in lifting it . The work done equals the force required to move it upward multiplied with the vertical distance it is moved ( remember W = Fd ) . The upward force required while moving at a constant velocity is equal to the weight , mg , of an object , so the work done in lifting it through a height h is the product mgh . Thus , when accounting only for mass , gravity , and altitude , the equation is :
