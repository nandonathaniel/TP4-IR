Although some Egyptians did not support the Byzantine forces during the Arab conquest , some villages started to organise against the new invaders . After the Battle of Nikiou on 13 May 641 , Arab troops , having defeated the Byzantine forces , destroyed many Egyptian villages on their march to Alexandria as the Delta rebelled against the new invaders . The Egyptian resistance seems to have been village by village without a unified command and therefore failed .
