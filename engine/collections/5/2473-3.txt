The Great Wall of China visible today largely dates from the Ming dynasty , as they rebuilt much of the wall in stone and brick , often extending its line through challenging terrain . Some sections remain in relatively good condition or have been renovated , while others have been damaged or destroyed for ideological reasons , deconstructed for their building materials , or lost due to the ravages of time . For long an object of fascination for foreigners , the wall is now a revered national symbol and a popular tourist destination .
