A US Marines Sergeant emailed ten of his friends in August 2004 having wrongly been told that Starbucks had stopped supplying the military with coffee donations because the company did not support the Iraq War . The email became viral , being sent to tens of millions of people . Starbucks and the originator sent out a correction , but Starbucks ' VP of global communications , Valerie O'Neil , said in September 2009 that the email was still being forwarded to her every few weeks .
