Strawberry Field was the name of a Salvation Army children 's home close to John Lennon 's childhood home in Woolton , a suburb of Liverpool . Lennon and his friends Pete Shotton , Nigel Walley and Ivan Vaughan used to play in the wooded garden behind the home . One of Lennon 's childhood treats was the garden party held each summer in Calderstones Park , near the home , where a Salvation Army brass band played . Lennon 's aunt Mimi Smith recalled : `` There was something about the place that always fascinated John . He could see it from his window ... He used to hear the Salvation Army band ( playing at the garden party ) , and he would pull me along , saying , ' Hurry up , Mimi -- we 're going to be late . ' ''
