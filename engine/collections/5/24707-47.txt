The earliest known version of the Romeo and Juliet tale akin to Shakespeare 's play is the story of Mariotto and Gianozza by Masuccio Salernitano , in the 33rd novel of his Il Novellino published in 1476 . Salernitano sets the story in Siena and insists its events took place in his own lifetime . His version of the story includes the secret marriage , the colluding friar , the fray where a prominent citizen is killed , Mariotto 's exile , Gianozza 's forced marriage , the potion plot , and the crucial message that goes astray . In this version , Mariotto is caught and beheaded and Gianozza dies of grief .
