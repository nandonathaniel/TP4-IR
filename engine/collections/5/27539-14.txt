Power electronic devices may be used as switches , or as amplifiers . An ideal switch is either open or closed and so dissipates no power ; it withstands an applied voltage and passes no current , or passes any amount of current with no voltage drop . Semiconductor devices used as switches can approximate this ideal property and so most power electronic applications rely on switching devices on and off , which makes systems very efficient as very little power is wasted in the switch . By contrast , in the case of the amplifier , the current through the device varies continuously according to a controlled input . The voltage and current at the device terminals follow a load line , and the power dissipation inside the device is large compared with the power delivered to the load .
