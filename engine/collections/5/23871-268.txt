The Treaty of Hubertusburg , between Austria , Prussia , and Saxony , was signed on 15 February 1763 , at a hunting lodge between Dresden and Leipzig . Negotiations had started there on 31 December 1762 . Frederick , who had considered ceding East Prussia to Russia if Peter III helped him secure Saxony , finally insisted on excluding Russia ( in fact , no longer a belligerent ) from the negotiations . At the same time , he refused to evacuate Saxony until its elector had renounced any claim to reparation . The Austrians wanted at least to retain Glatz , which they had in fact reconquered , but Frederick would not allow it . The treaty simply restored the status quo of 1748 , with Silesia and Glatz reverting to Frederick and Saxony to its own elector . The only concession that Prussia made to Austria was to consent to the election of Archduke Joseph as Holy Roman emperor . Saxony emerged from the war weakened and bankrupt ; despite losing no territory , Saxony had essentially been a battleground between Prussia and Austria throughout the conflict , with many of its ' towns and cities ( including the capital of Dresden ) damaged by bombardment and looting .
