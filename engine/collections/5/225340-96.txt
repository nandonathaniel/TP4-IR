Francis I of France had continued his policy of seeking a middle course in the religious rift in France until an incident called the Affair of the Placards . The Affair of the Placards began in 1534 , and started with protesters putting up anti-Catholic posters . The posters were not Lutheran but were Zwinglian or `` Sacramentarian '' in the extreme nature of the anti-Catholic content -- specifically , the absolute rejection of the Catholic doctrine of `` Real Presence . '' Protestantism became identified as `` a religion of rebels , '' helping the Catholic Church to more easily define Protestantism as heresy .
