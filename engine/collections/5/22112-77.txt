In late 2014 the Philadelphia 76ers broke ground in Camden ( across the street from the BB&T Pavilion ) to construct a new 125,000 - square - foot training complex . The Sixers Training Complex includes an office building and a 66,230 - square - foot basketball facility with two regulation - size basketball courts , a 2,800 - square - foot locker room , and a 7,000 - square - foot roof deck . The $83 million complex had its grand opening on September 23 , 2016 , and is expected to provide 250 jobs for the city of Camden . Also in late 2014 , Subaru of America announced that in an effort to consolidate their operations , their new 250,000 square foot headquarters would be located in Camden . The $118 million project broke ground in December 2015 but was put on hold in mid-2016 because the original plans for the complex had sewage and waste water being pumped into an outdated sewage system . Adjustments to the plans have been made and the project is expected to be completed in 2017 , creating up to 500 jobs in the city upon completion .
