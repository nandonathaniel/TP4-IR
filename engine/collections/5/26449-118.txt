Historically , the English had downplayed Columbus and emphasized the role of the Venetian John Cabot as a pioneer explorer , but for the emerging United States , Cabot made for a poor national hero . Veneration of Columbus in America dates back to colonial times . The name Columbia for `` America '' first appeared in a 1738 weekly publication of the debates of the British Parliament . The use of Columbus as a founding figure of New World nations and the use of the word `` Columbia '' , or simply the name `` Columbus '' , spread rapidly after the American Revolution . Columbus 's name was given to the federal capital of the United States ( District of Columbia ) , the capital cities of two U.S. states ( Ohio and South Carolina ) , and the Columbia River . Outside the United States the name was used in 1819 for the Gran Colombia , a precursor of the modern Republic of Colombia . Numerous cities , towns , counties , streets , and plazas ( called Plaza Colón or Plaza de Colón throughout Latin America and Spain ) have been named after him . A candidate for sainthood in the Catholic Church in 1866 , celebration of Columbus 's legacy perhaps reached a zenith in 1892 with the 400th anniversary of his first arrival in the Americas . Monuments to Columbus like the Columbian Exposition in Chicago and Columbus Circle in New York City were erected throughout the United States and Latin America extolling him .
