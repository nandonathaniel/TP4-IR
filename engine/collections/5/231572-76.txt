g has a number of correlates in the brain . Studies using magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) have established that g and total brain volume are moderately correlated ( r ~. 3 --. 4 ) . External head size has a correlation of ~. 2 with g . MRI research on brain regions indicates that the volumes of frontal , parietal and temporal cortices , and the hippocampus are also correlated with g , generally at . 25 or more , while the correlations , averaged over many studies , with overall grey matter and overall white matter have been found to be . 31 and . 27 , respectively . Some but not all studies have also found positive correlations between g and cortical thickness . However , the underlying reasons for these associations between the quantity of brain tissue and differences in cognitive abilities remain largely unknown .
