Under the same constant gravity assumptions , the potential energy , E , of a body at height h is given by E = mgh ( or E = Wh , with W meaning weight ) . This expression is valid only over small distances h from the surface of the Earth . Similarly , the expression h = v 2 2 g ( \ displaystyle h = ( \ tfrac ( v ^ ( 2 ) ) ( 2g ) ) ) for the maximum height reached by a vertically projected body with initial velocity v is useful for small heights and small initial velocities only .
