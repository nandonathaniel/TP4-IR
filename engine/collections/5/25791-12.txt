Since 2012 , a growing protest and advocacy movement called `` Fight for $15 '' , initially growing out of fast food worker strikes , has advocated for an increase in the minimum wage . On March 27 , 2014 , Connecticut passed legislation to raise the minimum wage from $8.70 to $10.10 by 2017 , making it one of about six states to aim at or above $10.00 per hour . In 2014 and 2015 , several cities , including San Francisco , Seattle , Los Angeles , and Washington passed ordinances that gradually increase the minimum wage to $15.00 . In 2016 , New York and California passed legislation that would gradually raise the minimum wage to $15 in each state .
