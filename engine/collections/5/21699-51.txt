While Caesar is tortured with starvation , the mute girl , whom Maurice names Nova , sneaks into the facility to give him food and water , although Rocket is forced to allow himself to be captured to create a distraction so that Nova can escape . Together , Caesar and Rocket are able to work out a means of accessing the ape cage via an underground tunnel that leads out of the facility , with Bad Ape and Maurice digging their way into the cage . After rescuing the children , Caesar sends his followers away while he confronts the Colonel , but the facility is subsequently attacked by the external military forces . When Caesar reaches the Colonel , he realizes that the Colonel has succumbed to the infection and is regressing to a primitive state . Caesar fights but ultimately spares the Colonel , who takes his own life rather than become a primitive . In a massive battle among Caesar 's apes , Alpha - Omega and the rival militants , Caesar attempts to throw the grenade to the facility 's fuel supplies , but he gets shot by Preacher . Red , a donkey - captured apes who give up freedom to work for humans against Caesar 's ape colony - redeems and sacrifices himself by killing Preacher , and saving Caesar 's life , helping to destroy the fuel tank . As the apes fall in numbers , an oncoming avalanche arrives , and wipes out the remaining Alpha - Omega soldiers , as well as the opposing militant forces , while the apes and Nova retreat to the safety of the trees .
