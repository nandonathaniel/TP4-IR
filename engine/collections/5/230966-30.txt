Border South : Missouri , Kentucky , Maryland , and Delaware were states on the outer rim of the Confederacy that did not secede from the United States in the 1860s , but did have significant numbers of residents who joined the Confederate armed forces . Kentucky and Missouri had Confederate governments - in - exile and were represented in the Confederate Congress and by stars on the Confederate battle flag . West Virginia formed in 1863 after the western region of Virginia broke away to protest the Old Dominion 's joining of the Confederacy , but residents of the new state were about evenly divided on supporting the Union or the Confederacy .
