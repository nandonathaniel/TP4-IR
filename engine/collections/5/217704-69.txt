Another plebeian tribune , Gaius Manilius , proposed the lex Manilia . It gave Pompey command of the forces and the areas of operation of Licinius Lucullus and in addition to this , Bithynia , which was held by Acilius Glabrio . It commissioned him to wage war on Mithridates and Tigranes . It allowed him to retain his naval force and his dominion over the sea granted by the lex Gabinia . Therefore , Phrygia , Lycaonia , Galatia , Cappadocia , Cilicia , Upper Colchis , Pontus and Armenia as well as the forces of Lucullus were added to his command . Plutarch noted that this meant the placing of Roman supremacy entirely in the hands of one man . The optimates were unhappy about so much power being given to Pompey and saw this as the establishment of a tyranny . They agreed to oppose the law , but they were fearful of the mood of the people . Only Catulus spoke up . The law was passed . The law was supported by Julius Caesar and justified by Cicero in his extant speech Pro Lege Manilia . Former consuls also supported the law . Cicero mentioned Gnaeus Cornelius Lentulus ( consul in 72 BC ) , Gaius Cassius Longinus Varus ( 73 BC ) , Gaius Scribonius Curio ( 76 BC ) and Publius Servilius Vatia Isauricus ( 79 BC ) . According to Cassius Dio , while this was happening , Pompey was preparing to sail to Crete to face Metellus Creticus ( see campaign against the pirates ) . Lucullus was incensed at the prospect of his replacement by Pompey . The outgoing commander and his replacement traded insults . Lucullus called Pompey a `` vulture '' who fed from the work of others . Lucullus was referring not merely to Pompey 's new command against Mithridates , but also his claim to have finished the war against Spartacus .
