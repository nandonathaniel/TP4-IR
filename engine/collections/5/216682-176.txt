Uganda It is unlikely that Uganda has a resident L. pictus population , as the species was heavily persecuted after a 1955 directive to shoot it on sight . Vagrant specimens occasionally enter the country via Tanzania and South Sudan . A survey taken in 1982 -- 1992 showed that the species was likely extirpated in Uganda , though sightings in some scattered areas may indicate that L. pictus is recolonising the country . Single individuals and small packs were sighted in Murchison Falls National Park , and were seen several times in the Northern Karamoja Controlled Hunting Area in 1994 .
