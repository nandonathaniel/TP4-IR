In 2006 -- 07 , Crosby notched 36 goals and 84 assists ( 120 points ) to lead the league in points and win the Art Ross Trophy . Ovechkin had a strong season as well , scoring 46 goals and 46 assists ( 92 points ) . The Penguins would improve much more quickly than the Capitals , as they secured their first playoff spot since 2001 by defeating the Capitals in their final meeting of the year . They were unable to find much success in the playoffs , as they were handed a 4 -- 1 series loss to the stronger , much more experienced Ottawa Senators in the conference quarterfinals .
