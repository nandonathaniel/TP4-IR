One day , Chris receives an unexpected phone call from Steel Dragon 's founder and rhythm guitarist , Kirk Cuddy ( Dominic West ) , and is offered an audition for the band ( thanks to two of Blood Pollution 's groupies , who showed Kirk a videotape of one of Blood Pollution 's concerts ) . After hanging up on Kirk once , thinking he 's being pranked by Rob , Chris ecstatically agrees . At the studio , he meets the band , as well as learning that Bobby Beers was fired because he was a closeted homosexual , and gives an outstanding performance of `` We All Die Young '' ( a Steel Dragon song in the movie , but it is actually a song by Steelheart , whose lead vocalist Miljenko Matijevic provides Cole 's singing voice for the film ) . Chris joins the band as their new singer , adopting the stage name `` Izzy '' . Following a successful debut concert with Steel Dragon , Izzy must come to grips with the pressures of his new - found fame and success . The band embarks on a lengthy tour and Izzy experiences the excesses of the lifestyle , with the group 's manager , Mats ( Timothy Spall ) , serving as a sympathetic mentor to Izzy .
