Hurricane Able in 1951 was initially thought to be the earliest forming major hurricane -- a tropical cyclone with winds exceeding 115 mph ( 185 km / h ) -- however following post-storm analysis it was determined that Able only reached Category 1 strength which made Hurricane Alma of 1966 the new record holder ; as it became a major hurricane on June 8 . Though it developed within the bounds of the Atlantic hurricane season , Hurricane Audrey in 1957 became the earliest developing Category 4 hurricane on record after it reached the intensity on June 27 . However , reanalysis from 1956 to 1960 by NOAA downgraded Audrey to a Category 3 , making Hurricane Dennis of 2005 the earliest Category 4 on record on July 8 , 2005 . The earliest - forming Category 5 hurricane , Emily , reached the highest intensity on the Saffir -- Simpson hurricane wind scale on July 17 , 2005 .
