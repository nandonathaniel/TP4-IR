Soon after , the river crosses south into Louisiana . The sister cities of Shreveport and Bossier City were developed on either bank of the river , as were the downriver cities of Alexandria and Pineville . Where it is joined by the Ouachita River , its largest tributary , the river later broadens into a complex network of marshlands surrounding the Mississippi and Atchafalaya rivers . Its waters eventually discharge into the Atchafalaya River and flow eastward or southward into the Gulf of Mexico .
