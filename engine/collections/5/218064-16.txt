Ilha da Queimada Grande , also known as Snake Island , one of many Snake Islands around the world , is an island off the coast of Brazil in the Atlantic Ocean . It is administered as part of the municipality of Peruíbe in the State of São Paulo . The island is small in size and has many different types of terrain , ranging from bare rock to rainforest , and a temperate climate . It is the only home of the critically endangered , venomous Bothrops insularis ( golden lancehead pit viper ) , which has a diet of birds . The snakes became trapped on the island when rising sea levels covered up the land that connected it to the mainland . This left the snakes to adapt to their environment , increasing rapidly in population and rendering the island dangerous to public visitation . Queimada Grande is closed to the public in order to protect this snake population ; access is only available to the Brazilian Navy and selected researchers vetted by the Chico Mendes Institute for Biodiversity Conservation , the Brazilian federal conservation unit .
