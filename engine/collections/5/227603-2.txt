The United States Flag Code establishes advisory rules for display and care of the national flag of the United States of America . It is Chapter 1 of Title 4 of the United States Code ( 4 U.S.C. ยง 1 et seq ) . This is a U.S. federal law , but the penalty described in Title 18 of the United States Code ( 18 U.S.C. ยง 700 ) for failure to comply with it is not enforced . In 1990 , the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in United States v. Eichman that prohibiting burning of the U.S. flag conflicts with the First Amendment right to freedom of speech and is therefore unconstitutional .
