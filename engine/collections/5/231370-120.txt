The Redskins ' fortunes continued to slide in 2009 , as they lost two of the first four matches , one of which was a 19 - 14 defeat at the hands of the Lions , a team that had not won a game since December 2007 . After that , they lost to Carolina on the road and Kansas City at home , the latter match handing another victory to a winless team . On Monday Night Football , the Redskins lost to Philadelphia in a game where Jim Zorn was temporarily relieved of his duties by offensive coordinator Sherman Lewis . In Week 10 , they inflicted a surprise defeat on the Denver Broncos before losing two divisional matches to Dallas and Philadelphia . The Week 13 game against an undefeated Saints team proved another surprise . The Redskins managed to tie at the end of regulation , and in overtime had a chance to break New Orleans ' winning streak . However , kicker Shaun Suisham missed a field goal that would have given them the victory . On their next possession , the Saints scored a FG and won the game 33 - 30 . Suisham was cut after the game and signed with Dallas ( his original team ) . The Redskins then routed Oakland in Week 14 before losing their last three games to finish 4 - 12 . The second match with the Cowboys ended in a 16 - 0 shutout , making for only the second season since 1970 where Washington lost all of its divisional matches . Jim Zorn was fired and replaced by Mike Shanahan afterwards .
