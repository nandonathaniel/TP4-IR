White sharks also attack dolphins and porpoises from above , behind or below to avoid being detected by their echolocation . Targeted species include dusky dolphins ( Lagenorhynchus obscurus ) , Risso 's dolphins ( Grampus griseus ) , bottlenose dolphins ( Tursiops ssp . ) , Humpback dolphins ( Sousa ssp . ) , harbour porpoises ( Phocoena phocoena ) , and Dall 's porpoises ( Phocoenoides dalli ) . Groups of dolphins have occasionally been observed defending themselves from sharks with mobbing behaviour . White shark predation on other species of small cetacean has also been observed . In August 1989 , a 1.8 - meter ( 5.9 ft ) juvenile male pygmy sperm whale ( Kogia breviceps ) was found stranded in central California with a bite mark on its caudal peduncle from a great white shark . In addition , white sharks attack and prey upon beaked whales . Cases where an adult Stejneger 's beaked whale ( Mesoplodon stejnegeri ) , with a mean mass of around 1,100 kg ( 2,400 lb ) , and a juvenile Cuvier 's beaked whale ( Ziphius cavirostris ) , an individual estimated at 3 m ( 9.8 ft ) , were hunted and killed by great white sharks have also been observed . When hunting sea turtles , they appear to simply bite through the carapace around a flipper , immobilizing the turtle . The heaviest species of bony fish , the oceanic sunfish ( Mola mola ) , has been found in great white shark stomachs .
