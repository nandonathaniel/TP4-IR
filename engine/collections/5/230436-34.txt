Lust for Life features recurring trap rhythms , classic rock references , `` sepia - toned '' orchestral backings , and Del Rey singing with a `` hip - hop affectation '' . The Daily Telegraph stated that the album `` lets a bit of light into the darkness of Del Rey 's moody past works , '' noting that `` there 's a sense of heightened drama in punchy Phil Spector style sixties back beats and the way the heavy timpani criss - crosses with echoing digital trap beats , all swathed in a gauzy haze of Shangri Las style girl group harmonies . '' The Guardian described the album 's sound as `` sleek contemporary - sounding soundscapes , '' and noted `` Summer Bummer '' 's `` eerie production and futuristic melancholy sounding closer to a track from Frank Ocean 's Blonde than her usual 50s and 60s enthralled shtick . '' The A.V. Club praised its modern simplicity , noting that `` its beats are subtle hip - hop twitches or electro - pop swells , with percussion redolent of faraway fireworks booms or mellifluous melodic washes .
