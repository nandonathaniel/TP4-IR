The conception of an opera as a coherent structure was slow to capture Handel 's imagination and he composed no operas for five years . In July 1717 Handel 's Water Music was performed more than three times on the River Thames for the King and his guests . It is said the compositions spurred reconciliation between the King , supposedly annoyed by the composer 's abandonment of his Hanover post , and Handel .
