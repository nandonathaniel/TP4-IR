Suttner 's mother and aunt considered themselves to be clairvoyant and thus went to gamble at Wiesbaden in the summer of 1856 , hoping to return with a fortune . Their losses were so heavy that they were forced to move to Vienna . During this trip Suttner received a proposal from Prince Philipp zu Sayn - Wittgenstein - Berleburg which was declined due to her young age . The family returned to Wiesbaden in 1859 ; the second trip was similarly unsuccessful , and they had to relocate to a small property in Klosterneuburg . Shortly after this , Suttner wrote her first published work , the novella Endertra√ºme im Monde , which appeared in Die Deutsche Frau . Continuing poor financial circumstances led Suttner to a brief engagement to the wealthy Gustav Heine von Geldern , thirty - one years her senior , whom she came to find unattractive and rejected ; her memoirs record her disgusted response to the older man 's attempt to kiss her .
