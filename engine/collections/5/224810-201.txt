The Axis states which assisted Japan included the authoritarian government of Thailand , which quickly formed a temporary alliance with the Japanese in 1941 , as the Japanese forces were already invading the peninsula of southern Thailand . The Phayap Army sent troops to invade and occupy northeastern Burma , which was former Thai territory that had been annexed by Britain much earlier . The official policy of the US government is that Thailand was not an ally of the Axis , and that the United States was not at war with Thailand . The policy of the US government ever since 1945 has been to treat Thailand not as a former enemy , but rather as a country which had been forced into certain actions by Japanese blackmail , before being occupied by Japanese troops . Thailand has been treated by the United States in the same way as such other Axis - occupied countries as Belgium , Czechoslovakia , Denmark , Greece , Norway , Poland , and the Netherlands .
