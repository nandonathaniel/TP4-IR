The importance of happiness as an end for humans has long been recognized . Forms of hedonism were put forward by Aristippus and Epicurus ; Aristotle argued that eudaimonia is the highest human good and Augustine wrote that `` all men agree in desiring the last end , which is happiness . '' Happiness was also explored in depth by Aquinas . Different varieties of consequentialism also existed in the ancient and medieval world , like the state consequentialism of Mohism or the political philosophy of Niccol√≤ Machiavelli . Mohist consequentialism advocated communitarian moral goods including political stability , population growth , and wealth , but did not support the utilitarian notion of maximizing individual happiness . Machiavelli was also an exponent of consequentialism . He believed that the actions of a state , however cruel or ruthless they may be , must contribute towards the common good of a society . Utilitarianism as a distinct ethical position only emerged in the eighteenth century .
