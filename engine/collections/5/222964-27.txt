All of the Silurian stories on television prior to 2010 were novelised . The novelisation of Doctor Who and the Silurians , Doctor Who and the Cave - Monsters ( 1974 ) adds a prologue which features the beginning of the Silurians ' hibernation ; the novelisation avoids referring to the reptiles as Silurians . Terrance Dicks ' novelisation of Warriors of the Deep ( 1984 ) describes Icthar , the sole survivor of the Silurian Triad , as a survivor of the Silurian colony in the caves near the nuclear research facility from Doctor Who and the Silurians ; according to this book , the Silurians were only sealed away , not destroyed . In Seventh Doctor Virgin New Adventures novel Blood Heat ( 1993 ) , Silurians of an alternate reality have conquered Earth after the Third Doctor was killed in their initial appearance . Contradicting the Warriors of the Deep novelisation , the novel The Scales of Injustice ( 1996 ) mentions that Icthar 's shelter awoke forty years before the events of Doctor Who and the Silurians , and that the shelter is located on the other side of the world to the British Isles . In The Scales of Injustice , the power - hungry Silurian Auggi plans to eradicate humanity , beginning with an invasion fleet of Silurian hybrids on the Kent coast . UNIT successfully fights off this fleet . The Third Doctor also learns about the Silurians ' battle cruisers and Myrka weapon in this book , both of which appear in Warriors of the Deep .
