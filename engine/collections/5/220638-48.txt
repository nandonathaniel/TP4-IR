Coxeter states that every zonogon ( a 2m - gon whose opposite sides are parallel and of equal length ) can be dissected into m ( m - 1 ) / 2 parallelograms . In particular this is true for regular polygons with evenly many sides , in which case the parallelograms are all rhombi . This decomposition of a regular hexagon is based on a Petrie polygon projection of a cube , with 3 of 6 square faces . Other parallelogons and projective directions of the cube are dissected within rectangular cuboids .
