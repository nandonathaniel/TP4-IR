Under the education reform movement started in the early 1990s by many state legislatures and the federal government , about two - thirds of the nation 's public high school students are required to pass a graduation exam , usually at the 10th and higher grade levels , though no new states had adopted a new requirement in 2006 . This requirement has been an object of controversy when states have started to withhold diplomas , and the right to attend commencement exercises , if a student does not meet the standards set by the state .
