The cheer was a pregame ritual until the early 2000s , chanting `` We 're gon na ' beat the hell out of you ! '' , but this was considered unsportsmanlike and banned . The university also briefly forbade the Million Dollar Band from playing it after games , because of its taunting nature . The move was met with a significant amount of criticism . In a vote at Homecoming 2005 , the question was posed to students of whether the cheer should be banned . 98 % of students voted in favor of keeping the cheer . Before the university 's attempt to remove the cheer , it was played before kickoff and at the end of the game . The cheer is now only played in the closing minutes when victory is certain , and is traditionally chanted twice . On at least one occasion ( during Alabama 's victory over Auburn in the 2008 Iron Bowl , Alabama 's first in the series since 2001 ) , it was repeated an additional four times to signify the breaking of the 6 - game losing streak to Auburn . After Alabama 's victory over the Florida Gators in the 2009 SEC Championship Game , as well as after Alabama 's victory over the Texas Longhorns in the 2010 Citi BCS National Championship Game , the cheer was played nine times . Depending on what team Alabama is playing , the Million Dollar Band and fans will call out to the opposing team by chanting the team 's mascot with the exception being Auburn University ; they do not refer to them as the Tigers , just as Auburn .
