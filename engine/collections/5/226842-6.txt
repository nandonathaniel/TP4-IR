Increasingly inexpensive logic chips such as the 7400 series allowed cheap dedicated circuitry for improved user interfaces such as keyboard input , instead of simply a row of switches to toggle bits one at a time . Use of audio cassettes for inexpensive data storage replaced manual re-entry of a program every time the device was powered on . Large cheap arrays of silicon logic gates in the form of read - only memory and EPROMs allowed utility programs and self - booting kernels to be stored within microcomputers . These stored programs could automatically load further more complex software from external storage devices without user intervention , to form an inexpensive turnkey system that does not require a computer expert to understand or to use the device . Random access memory became cheap enough to afford dedicating approximately 1 - 2 kilobytes of memory to a video display controller frame buffer , for a 40x25 or 80x25 text display or blocky color graphics on a common household television . This replaced the slow , complex , and expensive teletypewriter that was previously common as an interface to minicomputers and mainframes .
