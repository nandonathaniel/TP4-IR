Darius I and later Achaemenid emperors acknowledged their devotion to Ahura Mazda in inscriptions , as attested to several times in the Behistun inscription , and appear to have continued the model of coexistence with other religions . Whether Darius was a follower of Zoroaster has not been conclusively established , since devotion to Ahura Mazda was ( at the time ) not necessarily an indication of an adherence to Zoroaster 's teaching . A number of the Zoroastrian texts that today are part of the greater compendium of the Avesta have been attributed to that period . This calendar attributed to the Achaemenid period is still in use today . Additionally , the divinities , or yazatas , are present - day Zoroastrian angels ( Dhalla , 1938 ) .
