Eventually , Eli and Solara investigate an isolated house . They fall into a trap , but manage to allay the suspicions of the residents , George ( Michael Gambon ) and Martha ( Frances de la Tour ) , who invite them in for tea . When Eli realizes that the couple are cannibals , they attempt to leave just as Carnegie and his henchmen arrive . In the ensuing shootout , George , Martha and many of Carnegie 's men are killed . While Eli and Solara are captured , Carnegie threatens to kill Solara unless Eli surrenders the Bible . With the Bible now in his possession , Carnegie shoots Eli , leaving him for dead . Solara escapes and drives back to help Eli . Rather than chase her , Carnegie returns to the town , since his sole remaining vehicle is running low on fuel . Solara finds Eli , and they drive until they reach the Golden Gate Bridge , and then row to Alcatraz Island , where they find a group intent on preserving what they can of literature and music . Eli tells the guards that he has a copy of the King James Version of the Bible . Once inside , Eli , revealed to be blind , begins to dictate the Bible from memory to Lombardi ( Malcolm McDowell ) , the leader of the group .
