King Charles III John , who came to the throne of Norway and Sweden in 1818 , was the second king following Norway 's break from Denmark and the union with Sweden . Charles John was a complex man whose long reign extended to 1844 . He protected the constitution and liberties of Norway and Sweden during the age of Metternich . As such , he was regarded as a liberal monarch for that age . However , he was ruthless in his use of paid informers , the secret police and restrictions on the freedom of the press to put down public movements for reform -- especially the Norwegian national independence movement .
