Lake Erie Monster . There have been reports of persons spotting a creature akin to the Loch Ness Monster , but there have been no confirmed reports . There were reports in 1990 of people seeing a `` large creature moving in the water about 1,000 feet ( 300 m ) from their boat '' described as black in color , about 35 feet ( 11 m ) long , with a `` snakelike head '' , and moved as fast as a boat . Five other people reported seeing something similar on three separate occasions but there is no scientific evidence of such a creature . There is a beer named after the Lake Erie Monster as well as a hockey team . There were reports of people spotting a sea creature in the 19th century which was sometimes called `` Bessie '' or `` South Bay Bessie '' .
