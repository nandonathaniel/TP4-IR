In August 2017 Representative Eric Johnson , and in September 2017 House Speaker Joe Straus wrote to the Texas State Preservation Board asking that the plaque be removed . According to Straus , `` The plaque says that the Civil War was not an act of rebellion and was not primarily about slavery . This is not accurate , and Texans are not well - served by incorrect information about our history . '' `` Straus also reiterated his calls for the ' historical accuracy and context ' of the Capitol 's dozen or so other nods to the Civil War to be reviewed : ' We have an obligation to all the people we serve to ensure that our history is described correctly , especially when it comes to a subject as painful as slavery .
