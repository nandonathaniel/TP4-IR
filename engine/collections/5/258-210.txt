In the decade between the publication of Uncle Tom 's Cabin and the start of the American Civil War , between twenty and thirty anti-Tom books were published . Among these novels are two books titled Uncle Tom 's Cabin As It Is ( one by W.L. Smith and the other by C.H. Wiley ) and a book by John Pendleton Kennedy . More than half of these anti-Tom books were written by white women , with Simms commenting at one point about the `` Seemingly poetic justice of having the Northern woman ( Stowe ) answered by a Southern woman .
