Images of Orion in classical art are difficult to recognize , and clear examples are rare . There are several ancient Greek images of club - carrying hunters that could represent Orion , but such generic examples could equally represent an archetypal `` hunter '' , or indeed Heracles . Some claims have been made that other Greek art represents specific aspects of the Orion myth . A tradition of this type has been discerned in 5th century BC Greek pottery -- John Beazley identified a scene of Apollo , Delian palm in hand , revenging Orion for the attempted rape of Artemis , while another scholar has identified a scene of Orion attacking Artemis as she is revenged by a snake ( a counterpart to the scorpion ) in a funerary group -- supposedly symbolizing the hope that even the criminal Orion could be made immortal , as well as an astronomical scene in which Cephalus is thought to stand in for Orion and his constellation , also reflecting this system of iconography . Also , a tomb frieze in Taranto ( ca . 300 BC ) may show Orion attacking Opis . But the earliest surviving clear depiction of Orion in classical art is Roman , from the depictions of the Underworld scenes of the Odyssey discovered at the Esquiline Hill ( 50 -- 40 BC ) . Orion is also seen on a 4th - century bas - relief , currently affixed to a wall in the Porto neighborhood of Naples . The constellation Orion rises in November , the end of the sailing season , and was associated with stormy weather , and this characterization extended to the mythical Orion -- the bas - relief may be associated with the sailors of the city .
