Laozi is traditionally regarded as the founder of Taoism , intimately connected with the Daodejing and `` primordial '' ( or `` original '' ) Taoism . Popular ( `` religious '' ) Taoism typically presents the Jade Emperor as the official head deity . Intellectual ( `` elite '' ) Taoists , such as the Celestial Masters sect , usually present Laozi ( Laojun , `` Lord Lao '' ) and the Three Pure Ones at the top of the pantheon of deities .
