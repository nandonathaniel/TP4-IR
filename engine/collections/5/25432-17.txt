Normalized scientific form is the typical form of expression of large numbers in many fields , unless an unnormalized form , such as engineering notation , is desired . Normalized scientific notation is often called exponential notation -- although the latter term is more general and also applies when m is not restricted to the range 1 to 10 ( as in engineering notation for instance ) and to bases other than 10 ( as in 3.15 Ã— 2 ^ ) .
