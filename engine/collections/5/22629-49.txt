Many people with CF are on one or more antibiotics at all times , even when healthy , to prophylactically suppress infection . Antibiotics are absolutely necessary whenever pneumonia is suspected or a noticeable decline in lung function is seen , and are usually chosen based on the results of a sputum analysis and the person 's past response . This prolonged therapy often necessitates hospitalization and insertion of a more permanent IV such as a peripherally inserted central catheter or Port - a-Cath . Inhaled therapy with antibiotics such as tobramycin , colistin , and aztreonam is often given for months at a time to improve lung function by impeding the growth of colonized bacteria . Inhaled antibiotic therapy helps lung function by fighting infection , but also has significant drawbacks such as development of antibiotic resistance , tinnitus , and changes in the voice . Inhaled levofloxacin may be used to treat Pseudomonas aeruginosa in people with cystic fibrosis who are infected . The early management of Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection is easier and better , using nebulised antibiotics with or without oral antibiotics may sustain its eradication up to 2 years .
