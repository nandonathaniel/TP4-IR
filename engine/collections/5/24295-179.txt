A Finnish member of EU parliament Jussi Halla - aho was sentenced for both blasphemy and hate speech in 2012 by the Supreme Court after saying that `` Islam is a paedophilia religion '' and `` it 's a national and possibly even genetic special characteristic of the Somali people to rob passers - by and to be parasites living on the tax - payers ' money '' . According to Jussi Halla - aho himself , the latter was meant to criticize the fact that saying that Finns drink a lot and then kill people due to possibly genetic reasons was held to be in accordance of the ethics of the press by the self - regulatory organ of the mass - media . Fines are income - based in Finland . Halla - aho was sentenced to 50 day - fines and had to pay â‚¬ 550 based on his income .
