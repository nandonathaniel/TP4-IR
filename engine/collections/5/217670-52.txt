Sammy Davis , Jr. , a long - time friend of Sinatra , supporter of the Democratic Party , and member of the Rat Pack , was asked by John F. Kennedy not to attend the gala at the behest of his father Joseph , fearing that his interracial marriage to Swedish actress May Britt was too controversial for the time and occasion , much to Sammy 's and Sinatra 's dismay . Davis had already postponed his wedding to Britt until after the election , also at the request of the Kennedy campaign via Sinatra . Davis eventually switched his support to the Republican Party and Richard Nixon in the early 1970s . Harry Belafonte expressed sadness at the controversy , stating `` It was the ambassador , ( but ) we did n't know that until after . Sammy not being there was a loss . ''
