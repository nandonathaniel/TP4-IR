By receiving geomagnetic storm alerts and warnings ( e.g. by the Space Weather prediction Center ; via Space Weather satellites as SOHO or ACE ) , power companies can minimize damage to power transmission equipment , by momentarily disconnecting transformers or by inducing temporary blackouts . Preventative measures also exist , including preventing the inflow of GICs into the grid through the neutral - to - ground connection .
