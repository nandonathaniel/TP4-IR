The extraordinary demands of the Punic Wars , in addition to a shortage of manpower , exposed the tactical weaknesses of the manipular legion , at least in the short term . In 217 BC , near the beginning of the Second Punic War , Rome was forced to effectively ignore its long - standing principle that its soldiers must be both citizens and property owners . During the 2nd century BC , Roman territory saw an overall decline in population , partially due to the huge losses incurred during various wars . This was accompanied by severe social stresses and the greater collapse of the middle classes . As a result , the Roman state was forced to arm its soldiers at the expense of the state , which it did not have to do in the past .
