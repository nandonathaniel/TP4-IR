There is a secondary market that recycles usable scrap for many stainless steel markets . The product is mostly coil , sheet , and blanks . This material is purchased at a less - than - prime price and sold to commercial quality stampers and sheet metal houses . The material may have scratches , pits , and dents but is made to the current specifications .
