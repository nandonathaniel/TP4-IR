The German towns of Garmisch and Partenkirchen joined to organise the 1936 edition of the Winter Games , held on 6 -- 16 February . This was the last time the Summer and Winter Olympics were held in the same country in the same year . Alpine skiing made its Olympic debut , but skiing teachers were barred from entering because they were considered to be professionals . Because of this decision the Swiss and Austrian skiers refused to compete at the Games .
