The appropriate thickness of a layer of track ballast depends on the size and spacing of the ties , the amount of traffic on the line , and various other factors . Track ballast should never be laid down less than 150 mm ( 5.9 inches ) thick ; and high - speed railway lines may require ballast up to ‚ÅÑ metre ( 19.7 inches ) thick . An insufficient depth of ballast causes overloading of the underlying soil , and in unfavourable conditions overloading the soil causes the track to sink , usually unevenly . Ballast less than 300 mm ( 11.8 inches ) thick can lead to vibrations that damage nearby structures . However , increasing the depth beyond 300 mm ( 11.8 inches ) adds no extra benefit in reducing vibration .
