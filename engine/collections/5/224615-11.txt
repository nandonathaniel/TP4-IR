In federal politics , a vote of no confidence takes down the government , and votes of no confidence may be asserted automatically if the House of Commons rejects the government 's budget . Provincial governments may also fall if a motion of no confidence is passed by the legislature or if the legislature fails to pass a confidence measure ( e.g. the provincial budget ) .
