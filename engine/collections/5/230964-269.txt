The Convent of Las Descalzas Reales ( Monasterio de las Descalzas Reales ) resides in the former palace of King Charles I of Spain and Isabella of Portugal . Their daughter , Joan of Austria , founded this convent of nuns of the Poor Clare order in 1559 . Throughout the remainder of the 16th century and into the 17th century , the convent attracted young widowed or spinster noblewomen . Each woman brought with her a dowry . The riches quickly piled up , and the convent became one of the richest convents in all of Europe . It has many works of Renaissance and Baroque art , including a recumbent Christ by Gaspar Becerra , a staircase whose paintings were painted by an unknown artist ( perhaps Vel√°zquez ) and that are considered masterpieces of Spanish Illusionistic painting , and Brussels tapestries inspired by paintings of Rubens .
