Willis reads Pulp Fiction in almost precisely the opposite direction , finding `` its overarching project as a drive to turn shit into gold . This is one way of describing the project of redeeming and recycling popular culture , especially the popular culture of one 's childhood , as is Tarantino 's wont as well as his stated aim . '' Despite that , argues Fraiman , `` Pulp Fiction demonstrates ... that even an open pulpophile like Tarantino may continue to feel anxious and emasculated by his preferences . ''
