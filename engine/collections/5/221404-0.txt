Earth 's energy budget accounts for the balance between energy Earth receives from the Sun , and energy Earth radiates back into outer space after having been distributed throughout the five components of Earth 's climate system and having thus powered the so - called `` Earth 's heat engine '' . This system is made up of earth 's water , ice , atmosphere , rocky crust , and all living things .
