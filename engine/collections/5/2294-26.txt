Like an urban American Indian version of the Black Panthers formed by African American social activists , AIM initially addressed civil rights violations , but later broadened its scope to address human rights violations . Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King , Jr. , who also spoke eloquently on human rights issues , reached out to the Indian movement during the planning stage of his Poverty Campaign a few weeks before his assassination in Memphis , Tennessee , on April 4 , 1968 . Likewise , Robert F. Kennedy had met with Black Panther representatives in California and met with Indian movement representatives and visited reservations in Montana , New York , and elsewhere before his televised assassination on June 6 , 1968 in Los Angeles during his presidential campaign . RFK 's son David A. Kennedy was given the tribal - inspired honorary name Yellow Dove after his father 's death and before his own .
