The Pistons won two back - to - back championships in 1989 and 1990 , but with retirements and departures of several stars , they faded from relevance . The team hired former star Joe Dumars as general manager of the team in 2000 , and he began stockpiling draft picks and trading players . He landed defensive stalwart Ben Wallace and guard Richard Hamilton by trading established stars in controversial trades , signed Chauncey Billups ( considered an underachiever ) , and drafted Tayshaun Prince with the 23rd pick in the 2002 Draft . He was named the NBA Executive of the Year in 2003 for returning the Pistons to prominence .
