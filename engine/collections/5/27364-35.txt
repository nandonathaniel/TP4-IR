On the eastern seaboard of what became the United States , the four distinct English regions were New England , the Middle Colonies , the Chesapeake Bay Colonies ( Upper South ) , and the Lower South . Some historians add a fifth region of the Frontier , which was never separately organized . By the time that European settlers arrived around 1600 -- 1650 , a significant percentage of the Indians living in the eastern region had been ravaged by disease , possibly introduced to them decades before by explorers and sailors ( although no conclusive cause has ever been established ) .
