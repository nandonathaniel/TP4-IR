Friendly relations had been established with Koceľ on the journey to Rome . This activity in Pannonia made a conflict inevitable with the German episcopate , and especially with the bishop of Salzburg , to whose jurisdiction Pannonia had belonged for seventy - five years . In 865 Bishop Adalwin is found exercising all Episcopal rights there , and the administration under him was in the hands of the archpriest Riehbald . The latter was obliged to retire to Salzburg , but his superior was naturally disinclined to abandon his claims . Methodius sought support from Rome ; the Vita asserts that Koceľ sent him thither with an honorable escort to receive Episcopal consecration .
