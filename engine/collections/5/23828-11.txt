PICCs can remain in situ for extended periods of time , from seven days to 12 months , although little information is available with respect to viability timeframes . They are used in both the hospital and community settings . PICCs can be used for intravenous delivery of total parenteral nutrition ( TPN ) , chemotherapy , antibiotics or other medications , and can also be used for blood sampling if the lumen is 4 French or larger in size ( Arrow and Bard manufacturers guidelines ) . To maintain patency , PICC management should include regular flushing with normal saline and `` locking '' with Heparin or normal saline when not in use . The type of locking procedure depends on the type of PICC and bung ; Groshong PICCs have a three - way valve at the tip so the use of a heparin lock is not necessary , and there are no clamps on the external length . In comparison , Arrow PICCs have clamps on the exterior line and require a heparin lock . The use of heparin to maintain line patency , though , is questionable , and currently randomized clinical control trials are investigating this further . Heparin locks have been associated with complications , including heparin - induced thrombocytopaenia .
