There has been one World Series that ended on a runner caught stealing , on a play that involved three future Hall of Famers . In the bottom of the ninth inning of Game 7 of the 1926 World Series , Babe Ruth of the New York Yankees tried to steal second base with two outs and his team trailing the St. Louis Cardinals 3 -- 2 . Ruth was thrown out by Cardinals catcher Bob O'Farrell after Bob Meusel swung at and missed a pitch from Grover Cleveland Alexander . St. Louis second baseman Rogers Hornsby applied the tag on Ruth , who in his career was successful on 51 % of his stolen base attempts . Ruth , Alexander and Hornsby were inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame .
