With the domestication of the dog , birds of prey , and the ferret , various forms of animal - aided hunting developed , including venery ( scent hound hunting , such as fox hunting ) , coursing ( sight hound hunting ) , falconry , and ferreting . While these are all associated with medieval hunting , over time , various dog breeds were selected for very precise tasks during the hunt , reflected in such names as pointer and setter .
