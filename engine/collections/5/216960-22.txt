In the 2006 story arc `` Up , Up , and Away ! '' , Superman recovered a piece of Kryptonian sunstone , which Lex Luthor had used to awaken an ancient Kryptonian warship . Superman learned that the sunstone had been sent with him from Krypton , and used it to construct a new Fortress in the Arctic in exactly the same manner as in the 1978 Superman film . He nevertheless plans to restore the Peruvian Fortress , even if compromised and no longer in a secret location , and plans more Fortresses around the world . This version of the Fortress physically resembles the movie and television depictions , and Superman communicates with Jor - El via crystal constructs as in the Superman film and Smallville .
