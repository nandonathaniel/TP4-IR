No uniform numbers have been retired by Notre Dame . Upon being issued a number , each player is given a card which lists some of the more famous players who have worn that particular number . Number 3 is perhaps the most famous number in Irish football history , having been worn by Ralph Guglielmi , George Izo , Daryle Lamonica , Coley O'Brien , Joe Montana , Michael Floyd , Rick Mirer and Ron Powlus , among others . Number 5 is also notable , as it is the only number to be worn by one of the Four Horsemen ( Elmer Layden ) a Heisman Trophy Winner ( Paul Hornung ) and a National Title winning Quarterback ( Terry Hanratty ) . Number 7 has been worn by such Irish greats as 1964 Heisman Trophy winner John Huarte , 1970 Heisman runner - up Joe Theismann , Steve Beuerlein , Jimmy Clausen and Jarious Jackson .
