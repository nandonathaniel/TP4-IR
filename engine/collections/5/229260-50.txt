Second Chance ( Sam ' Kevin ' Chase ) - Abused as a child by his father , he became an expert hacker and ran away from home at the age of 13 . In original time , he died from injuries caused by falling from an airport fence , but witnessing the time crash led to him being hired by Interchronological Rescue and sent to spy on the time agency . There , he was JB 's projectionist , before manipulating and splitting time in Sabotaged and Torn , resulting in him being fired . He has also gone back in time to `` help '' Jonah and Katherine . In Redeemed , the adult version of him is killed by Mr. Rathbone . The young version of him is rescued by Jordan , and he is adopted by the Skidmores .
