Zeus was brother and consort of Hera . By Hera , Zeus sired Ares , Hebe and Hephaestus , though some accounts say that Hera produced these offspring alone . Some also include Eileithyia , Eris , Enyo and Angelos as their daughters . In the section of the Iliad known to scholars as the Deception of Zeus , the two of them are described as having begun their sexual relationship without their parents knowing about it . The conquests of Zeus among nymphs and the mythic mortal progenitors of Hellenic dynasties are famous . Olympian mythography even credits him with unions with Leto , Demeter , Metis , Themis , Eurynome and Mnemosyne . Other relationships with immortals included Dione and Maia . Among mortals were Semele , Io , Europa and Leda ( for more details , see below ) and with the young Ganymede ( although he was mortal Zeus granted him eternal youth and immortality ) .
