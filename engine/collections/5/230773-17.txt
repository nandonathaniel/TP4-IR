In 2000 , an open source application and open standards - based protocol called Jabber was launched . The protocol was standardized under the name Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol ( XMPP ) . XMPP servers could act as gateways to other IM protocols , reducing the need to run multiple clients . Multi-protocol clients can use any of the popular IM protocols by using additional local libraries for each protocol . IBM Lotus Sametime 's November 2007 release added IBM Lotus Sametime Gateway support for XMPP .
