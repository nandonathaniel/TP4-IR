G.S. Shivarudrappa made his mark in the Navya period with Mumbai Jataka ( `` A Horoscope of Bombay '' , 1966 ) , which takes a closer look at urbanised society in Mumbai . A protégé of Kuvempu , Shivarudrappa 's fame came the peak of popularity of romantic poems with his Samagma ( `` Songs of Equanimity '' , 1951 ) , poems distinguished by an idealistic bent . He continued to write poems in the same vein , although in his later poems there is a gradual shift to social issues with a streak of admiration for god 's creation . His critical essay , Anuranana ( 1980 ) , is about the Vachana poets of the 12th century , their tradition , style and influence on later poets .
