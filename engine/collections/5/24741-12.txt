The amu without the `` unified '' prefix is technically an obsolete unit based on oxygen , which was replaced in 1961 . However , many sources still use the term `` amu '' but now define it in the same way as u ( i.e. , based on carbon - 12 ) . In this sense , most uses of the terms `` atomic mass units '' and `` amu '' today actually refer to unified atomic mass unit . For standardization a specific atomic nucleus ( carbon - 12 vs. oxygen - 16 ) had to be chosen because the average mass of a nucleon depends on the count of the nucleons in the atomic nucleus due to mass defect . This is also why the mass of a proton or neutron by itself is more than ( and not equal to ) 1 u .
