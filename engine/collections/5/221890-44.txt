Many light rail systems -- even fairly old ones -- have a combination of both on - and off - road sections . In some countries ( especially in Europe ) , only the latter is described as light rail . In those places , trams running on mixed rights - of - way are not regarded as light rail , but considered distinctly as streetcars or trams . However , the requirement for saying that a rail line is `` separated '' can be quite low -- sometimes just with concrete `` buttons '' to discourage automobile drivers from getting onto the tracks . Some systems such as Seattle 's Link are truly mixed but closed to traffic , with light rail vehicles and traditional buses both operating along a common right - of - way .
