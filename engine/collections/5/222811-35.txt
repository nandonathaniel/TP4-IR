Justice Scalia penned a separate concurrence for four justices in Freytag . These justices dissented as to the Court majority 's rationale ; they would have characterized the Tax Court 's power as `` executive '' rather than `` judicial . '' Scalia said that to him `` it seem ( ed ) ... entirely obvious that the Tax Court , like the Internal Revenue Service , the FCC , and the NLRB , exercises executive power . '' Notwithstanding Scalia 's sharp dissents in landmark separation - of - powers cases such as Mistretta v. United States and Morrison v. Olson , Scalia apparently `` describe ( d ) Freytag as the single worst opinion of his incumbency '' on the U.S. Supreme Court .
