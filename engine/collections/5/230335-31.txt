Prisoner was created by Reg Watson , who had produced the British soap opera Crossroads from 1964 to 1973 and would create Australian soaps The Young Doctors , Sons and Daughters and Neighbours . Initially conceived as a 16 - episode series , the working title of the pilot episode was `` Women Behind Bars '' . Its storylines focused on the lives of the prisoners and , to a lesser extent , the officers and other prison staff . When the initial episodes met an enthusiastic reception , it was felt that Prisoner could be developed into an ongoing soap opera . The early storylines were developed and expanded , with assistance from the Corrective Services Department .
