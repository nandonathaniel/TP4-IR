Frameshifting may also occur during prophase translation , producing different proteins from overlapping open reading frames , such as the gag - pol - env retroviral proteins . This is fairly common in viruses and also occurs in bacteria and yeast ( Farabaugh , 1996 ) . Reverse transcriptase , as opposed to RNA Polymerase II , is thought to be a stronger cause of the occurrence of frameshift mutations . In experiments only 3 -- 13 % of all frameshift mutations occurred because of RNA Polymerase II . In prokaryotes the error rate inducing frameshift mutations is only somewhere in the range of . 0001 and . 00001 .
