This same period saw an increase of the importance of political `` clubs '' in French politics . Foremost among these was the Jacobin Club . While the Assembly met in Versailles , it was an unnamed group of Breton deputies to propose legislation . With the move to Paris , the group acquired a name and expanded its membership , first to other like - minded members of the Assembly , then to members of the general populace in Paris , and later throughout France . According to the 1911 Encyclop√¶dia Britannica , by 10 August 1790 there were already one hundred and fifty - two affiliated clubs . Despite the Jacobins ' later prominence during the Reign of Terror , in the summer and fall of 1790 they were still well within the mainstream of the popular or national party .
