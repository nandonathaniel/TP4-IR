There are about 5,000 potato varieties worldwide . Three thousand of them are found in the Andes alone , mainly in Peru , Bolivia , Ecuador , Chile , and Colombia . They belong to eight or nine species , depending on the taxonomic school . Apart from the 5,000 cultivated varieties , there are about 200 wild species and subspecies , many of which can be cross-bred with cultivated varieties . Cross-breeding has been done repeatedly to transfer resistances to certain pests and diseases from the gene pool of wild species to the gene pool of cultivated potato species . Genetically modified varieties have met public resistance in the United States and in the European Union .
