The Patriarch of Moscow serves as the head of the church and resides in the Danilov Monastery . Moscow was called the `` city of 40 times 40 churches '' -- `` город сорока сороков церквей '' -- prior to 1917 . In 1918 the Bolshevik government declared Russia a secular state , which in practice meant that religion was repressed and society was to become atheistic . During the period of 1920 - 1930s a great number of churches in Moscow were demolished , including historical Chudov Monastery in the Kremlin , dating from the 14th century , Kazansky Cathedral on the Red Square , the Cathedral of Christ the Savior , constructed in the 19th century in memory of a victory over Napoleon 's army in 1812 , and many more . This continued even after the Second World War , in 1940 - 1970s , when persecutions against religion in the Soviet Union became less severe . Most of the surviving churches and monasteries were closed and then used as clubs , offices , factories or even warehouses . Since the disintegration of the Soviet Union in 1991 many of the destroyed churches have been restored and traditional religions are once again gaining popularity . Among the churches reconstructed in the 1990s is an impressive new Cathedral of Christ the Savior that once more has become a landmark . It was built on the site of the old demolished cathedral , where there had been a huge open swimming - pool until 1994 .
