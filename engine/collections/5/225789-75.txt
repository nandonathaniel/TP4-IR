The first major change was made in preparation for the North Freeway connection , when the directions of Calhoun Avenue and Jefferson Street were swapped so that they would alternate . A bridge , dated 1954 , was built to carry traffic from Jefferson Street over traffic to Jefferson Street , and US 75 was moved to Calhoun Avenue northbound , soon crossing downtown on the one - way pair of Calhoun Avenue and Pierce Street to the new North Freeway . A median barrier was added in 1956 to prevent crossover accidents . Southeast of downtown Houston , the at - grade intersections proved dangerous , and only two had been replaced with interchanges by 1959 , when the Texas Highway Department began a program to upgrade the road to full freeway standards . Frontage roads would be required along the entire highway , since the state had not purchased access rights , and so abutting property owners were able to build driveways to the road . To accomplish this , traffic was shifted to the newly built frontage roads so that the central main lanes could be reconstructed . This grade separation was completed from Houston to Almeda - Genoa Road ( exit 34 ) in June 1959 , Farm to Market Road 1959 ( exit 30 ) in October 1964 , Farm to Market Road 518 ( exit 23 ) in December 1970 , and Farm to Market Road 1764 ( exit 15 ) in 1976 . As the section beyond FM 1764 into Galveston had already been rebuilt , this marked the completion of the Gulf Freeway as an actual freeway .
