Armenia and the EU were set to sign an Association Agreement in early September 2013 , however the agreement was called off by Armenia , prior to Armenia joining the Eurasian Union in 2014 . Though , a revised Comprehensive and Enhanced Partnership Agreement was later finalized between Armenia and the EU in February 2017 . Armenia further participates in the Eastern Partnership Program and the Euronest Parliamentary Assembly which aims at forging closer political and economic ties with the EU .
