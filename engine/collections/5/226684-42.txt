Taking up the cause of Maxwell Field was freshman Congressman J. Lister Hill , a World War I veteran who served with the 17th and 71st U.S. Infantry Regiments . He , as well as other Montgomery leaders , recognized the historical significance of the Wright Brother 's first military flying school and the potential of Maxwell Field to the local economy . In 1925 Hill , a member of the House Military Affairs Committee , affixed an amendment to a military appropriations bill providing $200,000 for the construction of permanent buildings at Maxwell Field . This amendment did not have the approval of the War Department nor the Army Air Corps , but as a result of this massive spending on Maxwell Field , the War Department kept it open . Hill recognized that to keep Maxwell Field open , it needed to be fiscally or militarily valuable to the War Department .
