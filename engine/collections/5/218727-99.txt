Mechanical approaches , such as vacuuming up the insects and heat - treating or wrapping mattresses , are effective . An hour at a temperature of 45 ° C ( 113 ° F ) or over , or two hours at less than − 17 ° C ( 1 ° F ) kills them ; a domestic clothes drier or steam could kill them . A study found 100 % mortality rates for bed bugs exposed to temperatures greater than 50 ° C ( 122 ° F ) for more than 2 minutes . The study recommended maintaining temperatures of above 48 ° C for more than 20 min to effectively kill all life stages of bed bugs , and because in practice treatment times of 6 to 8 hours are used to account for cracks and indoor clutter . This method is expensive and has caused fires . Starving them is not effective as they can survive without eating for 100 to 300 days , depending on temperature . For public health reasons , individuals are encouraged to call a professional pest control service to eradicate bed bugs in a home , rather than attempting to do it themselves , particularly if they live in a multifamily building .
