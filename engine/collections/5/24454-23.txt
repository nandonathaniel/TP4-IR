Religious beliefs in the Eastern Empire and Iran were in flux during the late sixth and early seventh centuries . Judaism was an active proselytising faith , and at least one Arab political leader converted to it . Christianity had active missions competing with the Persians ' Zoroastrianism in seeking converts , especially among residents of the Arabian Peninsula . All these strands came together with the emergence of Islam in Arabia during the lifetime of Muhammad ( d . 632 ) . After his death , Islamic forces conquered much of the Eastern Empire and Persia , starting with Syria in 634 -- 635 and reaching Egypt in 640 -- 641 , Persia between 637 and 642 , North Africa in the later seventh century , and the Iberian Peninsula in 711 . By 714 , Islamic forces controlled much of the peninsula in a region they called Al - Andalus .
