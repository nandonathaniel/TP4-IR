The Puritans in England first sent smaller groups in the mid-1620s to establish colonies , buildings , and food supplies , learning from the Pilgrims ' harsh experiences of winter in the Plymouth Colony . In 1623 , the Plymouth Council for New England ( successor to the Plymouth Company ) established a small fishing village at Cape Ann under the supervision of the Dorchester Company . The first group of Puritans moved to a new town at nearby Naumkeag after the Dorchester Company dropped support , and fresh financial support was found by Rev. John White . Other settlements were started in nearby areas ; however , the overall Puritan population remained small through the 1620s .
