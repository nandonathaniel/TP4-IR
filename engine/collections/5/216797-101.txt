Despite the investment in the Douwe Egbert product , Burger King announced it would be phasing out the Cafitesse system in the United States in the summer of 2010 in favor of Starbucks ' Seattle 's Best brand of coffee . Throughout the summer of 2010 , BK added several new coffee - based products to the new coffee line in an initial effort to bring in more customers during the morning sales period . The new coffee products , including flavored coffees and iced coffee drinks , are available all day to compete with McDonald 's McCaf√© coffee line . Every Friday during November 2010 , Burger King gave away free 12 US fl oz ( 350 ml ) cups of Seattle 's Best Coffee to encourage people to try its breakfast and coffee lines . The company predicted the number of free cups of coffee would number between two and four million .
