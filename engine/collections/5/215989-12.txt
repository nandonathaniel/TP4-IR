In Casablanca , Wilson sings the song as written ( `` You must remember this ... '' ) , but does not sing the Prelude ( `` This day and age we 're living in ... '' ) . The omitted lines refer to Albert Einstein . Although referenced as `` Prelude '' , the section omitted in Casablanca is actually in the middle of the song .
