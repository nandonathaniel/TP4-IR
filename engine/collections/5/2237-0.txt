The history of the Great Wall of China began when fortifications built by various states during the Spring and Autumn ( 771 -- 476 BC ) and Warring States periods ( 475 -- 221 BC ) were connected by the first emperor of China , Qin Shi Huang , to protect his newly founded Qin dynasty ( 221 -- 206 BC ) against incursions by nomads from Inner Asia . The walls were built of rammed earth , constructed using forced labour , and by 212 BC ran from Gansu to the coast of southern Manchuria .
