Two mirror image tombs are located at the southern corners of the jilaukhana . They are conceived as miniature replicas of the main complex and stand on raised platforms accessed by steps . Each octagonal tomb is constructed on a rectangular platform flanked by smaller rectangular buildings in front of which is laid a charbargh garden . Some uncertainty exists as to whom the tombs might memorialise . Their descriptions are absent from the contemporary accounts either because they were unbuilt or because they were ignored , being the tombs of women . On the first written document to mention them , the plan drawn up by Thomas and William Daniel in 1789 , the eastern tomb is marked as that belonging to Akbarabadi Mahal and the western as Fatehpuri Mahal ( two of Jahan 's other wives ) .
