Improved Davies ' attack : while linear and differential cryptanalysis are general techniques and can be applied to a number of schemes , Davies ' attack is a specialized technique for DES , first suggested by Donald Davies in the eighties , and improved by Biham and Biryukov ( 1997 ) . The most powerful form of the attack requires 2 known plaintexts , has a computational complexity of 2 , and has a 51 % success rate .
