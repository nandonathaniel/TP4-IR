Encompasses both secular and religious styles , the design and style made by Muslims and their construction of buildings and structures in Islamic culture included the architectural types : the Mosque , the Tomb , the Palace and the Fort . Perhaps the most important expression of Islamic art is architecture , particularly that of the mosque . Through Islamic architecture , effects of varying cultures within Islamic civilization can be illustrated . Generally , the use of Islamic geometric patterns and foliage based arabesques were striking . There was also the use of decorative calligraphy instead of pictures which were haram ( forbidden ) in mosque architecture . Note that in secular architecture , human and animal representation was indeed present .
