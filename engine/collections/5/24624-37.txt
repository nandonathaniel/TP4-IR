The ship that truly launched the first phase of the Portuguese discoveries along the African coast was the caravel , a development based on existing fishing boats . They were agile and easier to navigate , with a tonnage of 50 to 160 tons and 1 to 3 masts , with lateen triangular sails allowing luffing . The caravel benefited from a greater capacity to tack . The limited capacity for cargo and crew were their main drawbacks , but have not hindered its success . Among the famous caravels are Berrio and Anunciação .
