The central assumption of such an approach is that structures of interest / organs have a repetitive form of geometry . Therefore , one can seek for a probabilistic model towards explaining the variation of the shape of the organ and then when segmenting an image impose constraints using this model as prior . Such a task involves ( i ) registration of the training examples to a common pose , ( ii ) probabilistic representation of the variation of the registered samples , and ( iii ) statistical inference between the model and the image . State of the art methods in the literature for knowledge - based segmentation involve active shape and appearance models , active contours and deformable templates and level - set based methods .
