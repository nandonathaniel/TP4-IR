Some historians have suggested that the mysterious sicknesses afflicting the early English colonists at Jamestown , Virginia ( 1607 -- 1610 ) -- which nearly extinguished the settlement -- reflect sea water poisoning . The settlers arrived in the spring , when the James River water was relatively fresh , but by summer a drought of historical magnitude had rendered it much more brackish . The historical geographer Carville Earle , among others , holds to this view .
