The band was signed to Reprise Records in 1966 and released their first single , `` Ai n't It Hard '' , in the latter part of the year . Their first album , The Electric Prunes , included the band 's two nationally charting songs , `` I Had Too Much to Dream ( Last Night ) '' and `` Get Me to the World on Time '' . With the appearance of their second album , Underground , the band was more free to create their own material . However , the original group disbanded by 1968 when they proved unable to record the innovative and complex arrangements by David Axelrod on the albums Mass in F Minor and Release of an Oath . Both albums were released under the band 's name , the rights to which were owned by their record producer David Hassinger , but were largely performed by other musicians . Several of the original band members reconvened in 1999 and began recording again . The band still performs occasionally , although the only remaining original member is lead singer James Lowe .
