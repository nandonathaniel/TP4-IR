Thomas Cavalier - Smith , who has published extensively on the classification of protists , has recently proposed that the Neomura , the clade that groups together the Archaea and Eucarya , would have evolved from Bacteria , more precisely from Actinobacteria . His 2004 classification treated the archaeobacteria as part of a subkingdom of the Kingdom Bacteria , i.e. he rejected the three - domain system entirely . Stefan Luketa in 2012 proposed a five `` dominion '' system , adding Prionobiota ( acellular and without nucleic acid ) and Virusobiota ( acellular but with nucleic acid ) to the traditional three domains .
