It was released in June 2004 and received medium airplay on MuchMusic in Canada and MTV in the U.S. Though the video was popular on the MTV video chart show Total Request Live , the single itself was less successful than the original Go - Go 's song in the U.S. , failing to chart on the Hot 100 . In Australia it reached number eight . The song was later included on Duff 's compilation album , Most Wanted ( 2005 ) .
