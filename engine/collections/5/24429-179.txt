Before the advent of the short ballot in the early 20th century , as described above , the most common means of electing the presidential electors was through the general ticket . The general ticket is quite similar to the current system and is often confused with it . In the general ticket , voters cast ballots for individuals running for presidential elector ( while in the short ballot , voters cast ballots for an entire slate of electors ) . In the general ticket , the state canvass would report the number of votes cast for each candidate for elector , a complicated process in states like New York with multiple positions to fill . Both the general ticket and the short ballot are often considered at - large or winner - takes - all voting . The short ballot was adopted by the various states at different times ; it was adopted for use by North Carolina and Ohio in 1932 . Alabama was still using the general ticket as late as 1960 and was one of the last states to switch to the short ballot .
