In Toy Story 3 , several years after Toy Story 2 , only Sarge and two paratroopers are seen . Woody orders Sarge and his men to retrieve Andy 's cellphone . That plan , however , fails , and knowing that Andy is going to get out the garbage bag , Sarge and his last two men leave Andy 's room to find a better life . Buzz believes they are going AWOL , but Sarge claims that their mission is complete , and that when trash bags come out , the Army men are always the first to be thrown away ( it 's likely that the rest of the soldiers had either left prior to that day , or were sold in a yard sale ) . They appear again at the end of the film where they land in Sunnyside , and possibly recognizing Barbie , begin a happy new life under Barbie and Ken 's leadership .
