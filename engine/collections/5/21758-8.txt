The Industrial Revolution began in Britain , based on coal , steam , and textile mills . Political change in continental Europe was spurred by the French Revolution under the motto liberté , égalité , fraternité .

But his rise stimulated both nationalism and reaction and he was defeated in 1814 -- 15 as the old royal conservatives returned to power .
