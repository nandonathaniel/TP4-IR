K2 is just 237 m ( 778 ft ) smaller than the 8,848 m ( 29,029 ft ) Mount Everest . The range is about 500 km ( 310 mi ) in length and the most heavily glaciated part of the world outside of the polar regions . The Siachen Glacier at 76 km ( 47 mi ) and the Biafo Glacier at 67 km ( 42 mi ) rank as the world 's second and third - longest glaciers outside the polar regions . Just to the west of the northwest end of the Karakoram , lies the Hindu Raj range , beyond which is the Hindu Kush range . The southern boundary of the Karakoram is formed by the Gilgit , Indus and Shyok rivers , which separate the range from the northwestern end of the Himalayas .
