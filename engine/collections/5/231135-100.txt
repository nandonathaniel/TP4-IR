The Arameans were a Northwest Semitic semi-nomadic and pastoralist people who originated in what is now modern Syria ( Biblical Aram ) during the Late Bronze Age and the early Iron Age . Large groups migrated to Mesopotamia , where they intermingled with the native Akkadian ( Assyrian and Babylonian ) population . The Aramaeans never had a unified empire ; they were divided into independent kingdoms all across the Near East . After the Bronze Age collapse , their political influence was confined to a number of Syro - Hittite states , which were entirely absorbed into the Neo-Assyrian Empire by the 8th century BC .
