One of the most violent events in recent times took place during the Gujarat riots in 2002 , where it is estimated one thousand people were killed , most allegedly Muslim . Some sources claim there were approximately 2,000 Muslim deaths . There were also allegations made of state involvement . The riots were in retaliation to the Godhra train burning in which 59 Hindus pilgrims returning from the disputed site of the Babri Masjid , were burnt alive in a train fire at the Godhra railway station . Gujarat police claimed that the incident was a planned act carried out by extremist Muslims in the region against the Hindu pilgrims . The Bannerjee commission appointed to investigate this finding declared that the fire was an accident . In 2006 the High Court decided the constitution of such a committee was illegal as another inquiry headed by Justice Nanavati Shah was still investigating the matter .
