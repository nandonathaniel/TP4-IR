Sanger 's view of eugenics was influenced by Havelock Ellis and other British eugenicists , who held that environmentally acquired traits were inherited by one 's progeny . Consequently , she rejected race and ethnicity as determining factors . Instead , she stressed limiting the number of births to live within one 's economic ability to raise and support healthy children . This would lead to a betterment of society and the human race . Sanger 's view put her at odds with leading American eugenicists , such as Charles Davenport , who took a racist view of inherited traits . She continually rejected their approach .
