Reiner later recalled that Lyne was going to direct the film , but had promised himself a vacation following the production of 91‚ÅÑ2 Weeks , and would not be available to start production until the spring of 1986 . Reiner , better known at the time as the actor who had played ' Meathead ' Stivic in All in the Family , was sent the script by Scheinman , and his initial reaction was the script had promise but `` no focus '' . After Lyne withdrew from the project , Reiner signed on to direct in September 1984 . Reiner realized the story should focus on Gordie , as `` his father always paid more attention to his older brother '' and he identified with that , as he struggled with the shadow of fame cast by his comedian father , Carl Reiner . The writers incorporated Reiner 's suggestions , producing a new script by December 1984 for Embassy 's review and approval .
