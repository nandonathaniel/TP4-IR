Cameron returned to Pomona , California and stayed at the home of science fiction writer Randall Frakes , where he wrote the draft for The Terminator . Cameron 's influences included 1950s science fiction films , the 1960s fantasy television series The Outer Limits , and contemporary films such as The Driver ( 1978 ) and Mad Max 2 ( 1981 ) . To translate the draft into a script , Cameron enlisted his friend Bill Wisher , who had a similar approach to storytelling . Cameron gave Wisher scenes involving Sarah Connor and the police department to write . As Wisher lived far from Cameron , the two communicated ideas by recording tapes of what they wrote by telephone . Frakes and Wisher would later write the US - released novelization of the movie .
