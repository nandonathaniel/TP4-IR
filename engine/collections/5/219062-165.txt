In 714 BC , the Assyrians under Sargon II defeated the Urartian King Rusa I at Lake Urmia and destroyed the holy Urartian temple at Musasir . At the same time , an Indo - European tribe called the Cimmerians attacked Urartu from the north - west region and destroyed the rest of his armies . Under Ashurbanipal ( 669 -- 627 BC ) the boundaries of the Assyrian Empire reached as far as Armenia and the Caucasus Mountains . The Medes under Cyaxares invaded Assyria later on in 612 BC , and then took over the Urartian capital of Van towards 585 BC , effectively ending the sovereignty of Urartu . According to the Armenian tradition , the Medes helped the Armenians establish the Orontid dynasty .
