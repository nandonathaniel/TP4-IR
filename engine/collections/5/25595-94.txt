German geographer Friedrich Ratzel visited North America beginning in 1873 and saw the effects of American manifest destiny . Ratzel sympathized with the results of `` manifest destiny '' , but he never used the term . Instead he relied on the Frontier Thesis of Frederick Jackson Turner . Ratzel promoted overseas colonies for Germany in Asia and Africa , but not an expansion into Slavic lands . Later German publicists misinterpreted Ratzel to argue for the right of the German race to expand within Europe ; that notion was later incorporated into Nazi ideology , as Lebensraum . Harriet Wanklyn ( 1961 ) argues that Ratzel 's theory was designed to advance science , and that politicians distorted it for political goals .
