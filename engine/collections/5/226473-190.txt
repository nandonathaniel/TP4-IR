The Procession , held at sundown , consists of a non-motorized parade through downtown Tucson featuring many floats , sculptures , and memorials , in which the community is encouraged to participate . The parade is followed by performances on an outdoor stage , culminating in the burning of an urn in which written prayers have been collected from participants and spectators . The event is organized and funded by the non-profit arts organization Many Mouths One Stomach , with the assistance of many volunteers and donations from the public and local businesses .
