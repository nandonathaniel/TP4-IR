In September 1940 , Vichy France was forced to allow Japan to occupy French Indochina , a federation of French colonial possessions and protectorates encompassing modern day Vietnam , Laos , and Cambodia . The Vichy regime continued to administer them under Japanese military occupation . French Indochina was the base for the Japanese invasions of Thailand , Malaya , and the Dutch East Indies . In 1945 , under Japanese sponsorship , the Empire of Vietnam and the Kingdom of Kampuchea were proclaimed as Japanese puppet states .
