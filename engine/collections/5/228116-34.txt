When King George III succeeded to the throne of Great Britain upon the death of his grandfather , George II , he was 22 years old and unmarried . His mother and advisors were anxious to have him settled in marriage . The 17 - year - old Princess Charlotte of Mecklenburg - Strelitz appealed to him as a prospective consort partly because she had been brought up in an insignificant north German duchy and therefore would probably have had no experience or interest in power politics or party intrigues . That proved to be the case ; to make sure , he instructed her shortly after their wedding `` not to meddle , '' a precept she was glad to follow . The King announced to his Council in July 1761 , according to the usual form , his intention to wed the Princess , after which a party of escorts , led by the Earl Harcourt , departed for Germany to conduct Princess Charlotte to England . They reached Strelitz on 14 August 1761 , and were received the next day by the reigning duke , Princess Charlotte 's brother , at which time the marriage contract was signed by him on the one hand and Earl Harcourt on the other . Three days of public celebrations followed , and on 17 August 1761 , the Princess set out for Britain , accompanied by her brother , Duke Adolphus Frederick , and by the British escort party . On 22 August , they reached Cuxhaven , where a small fleet awaited to convey them to England . The voyage was extremely difficult ; the party encountered three storms at sea , and landed at Harwich only on 7 September . They set out at once for London , spent that night in Witham , at the residence of Lord Abercorn , and arrived at 3 : 30 pm the next day at St. James 's Palace in London . They were received by the King and his family at the garden gate , which marked the first meeting of the bride and groom .
