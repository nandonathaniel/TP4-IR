This is corroborated by an early Sabaic inscription , where a religious ritual was `` postponed '' ( ns ' ' w ) due to war . According to the context of this inscription , the verb ns ' ' has nothing to do with intercalation , but only with moving religious events within the calendar itself . The similarity between the religious concept of this ancient inscription and the Qur'an suggests that non-calendaring postponement is also the Qur'anic meaning of Nasī ' . Thus the Encyclopaedia of Islam concludes `` The Arabic system of ( Nasī ' ) can only have been intended to move the Hajj and the fairs associated with it in the vicinity of Mecca to a suitable season of the year . It was not intended to establish a fixed calendar to be generally observed . ''
