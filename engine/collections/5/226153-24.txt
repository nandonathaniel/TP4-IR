In the Roman Catholic Church the name Baptism of Bells has been given to the ceremonial blessing of church bells , at least in France , since the eleventh century . It is derived from the washing of the bell with holy water by the bishop , before he anoints it with the `` oil of the infirm '' without and with chrism within ; a fuming censer is placed under it and the bishop prays that these sacramentals of the Church may , at the sound of the bell , put the demons to flight , protect from storms , and call the faithful to prayer .
