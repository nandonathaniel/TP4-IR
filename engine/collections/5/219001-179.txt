In the Cars Toon , Time Travel Mater , Stanley appears alive for the first time . In the Cars Land theme park , signage commemorating `` The Original Radiator Spring '' claims that `` On this site in the summer of 1909 Stanley , exploring out west , overheated as his radiator water boiled away . Coasting into the shade , he happened upon a life - saving natural spring . Upon this most fortunate discovery , Stanley founded the first settlement in Ornament Valley , and in honor of the oasis , christened it Radiator Springs . '' Stanley 's Oasis is listed as the first local business in Radiator Springs , although condensers only appeared on Stanley steam cars beginning in 1915 .
