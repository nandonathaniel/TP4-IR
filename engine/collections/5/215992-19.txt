Skillet 's lead singer and primary songwriter John L. Cooper explained the meaning of the song to theskilletsizzle.com ; `` the song is about my relationship with my Dad and feeling that I was kind of betrayed by him and all these bad feelings going on . But in the end , it came down to ' forgiveness ' in the end when I forgave my Dad there was a real healing that came in my life and the song The Older I Get was about that and saying I wish I could go back ... do it all over again and I would probably make that step earlier towards forgiving him because my life got so much better when I did .
