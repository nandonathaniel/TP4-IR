Eight points -- all the rocks thrown by one team counting -- is the highest score possible in an end , and is known as an `` eight - ender '' or `` snowman '' . Scoring an eight - ender against a relatively competent team is very difficult ; in curling , it is considered the equivalent of pitching a perfect game in baseball . Probably the best - known snowman came at the 2006 Players ' Championships . Future ( 2007 ) World Champion Kelly Scott scored eight points in one of her games against 1998 World bronze medalist Cathy King .
