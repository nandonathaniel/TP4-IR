Pennant and others have noted that the only trees growing on the island are elders ( Sambucus nigra ) or bourtrees in the Scots dialect , found as a grove known as The Bourtrees at the Trammins on the southern end of the island . This visitor also rather quaintly mentions that he was surprised to find three species of `` reptiles '' by which he meant molluscs , namely a naked black slug , the garden snail Helix aspersa and one of the common striped snails of the genus Cepaea . He speculated that they had accidentally been brought over from the mainland secreted within vegetables .
