Distress signals were sent by wireless , rockets , and lamp , but none of the ships that responded was near enough to reach Titanic before she sank . A radio operator on board the Birma , for instance , estimated that it would be 6 a.m. before the liner could arrive at the scene . Meanwhile , the SS Californian , which was the last to have been in contact before the collision , saw Titanic 's flares but failed to assist . Around 4 a.m. , RMS Carpathia arrived on the scene in response to Titanic 's earlier distress calls .
