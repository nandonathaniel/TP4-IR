Debbie Reynolds as Kathy Selden . Directors Gene Kelly and Stanley Donen insisted that Reynolds was always first in their minds for the role . Although the film revolves around the idea that Kathy has to dub over for Lina 's voice , in the scene where Kathy is dubbing a line of Lina 's dialogue ( `` Our love will last ' til the stars turn cold '' ) , Jean Hagen 's normal voice is used .
