Each of the condemned , said Coke , would be drawn backwards to his death , by a horse , his head near the ground . He was to be `` put to death halfway between heaven and earth as unworthy of both '' . His genitals would be cut off and burnt before his eyes , and his bowels and heart then removed . Then he would be decapitated , and the dismembered parts of his body displayed so that they might become `` prey for the fowls of the air '' . Confessions and declarations from the prisoners were then read aloud , and finally the prisoners were allowed to speak . Rookwood claimed that he had been drawn into the plot by Catesby , `` whom he loved above any worldy man '' . Thomas Wintour begged to be hanged for himself and his brother , so that his brother might be spared . Fawkes explained his not guilty plea as ignorance of certain aspects of the indictment . Keyes appeared to accept his fate , Bates and Robert Wintour begged for mercy , and Grant explained his involvement as `` a conspiracy intended but never effected '' . Only Digby , tried on a separate indictment , pleaded guilty , insisting that the King had reneged upon promises of toleration for Catholics , and that affection for Catesby and love of the Catholic cause mitigated his actions . He sought death by the axe and begged mercy from the King for his young family . His defence was in vain ; his arguments were rebuked by Coke and Northumberland , and along with his seven co-conspirators , he was found guilty by the jury of high treason . Digby shouted `` If I may but hear any of your lordships say , you forgive me , I shall go more cheerfully to the gallows . '' The response was short : `` God forgive you , and we do . ''
