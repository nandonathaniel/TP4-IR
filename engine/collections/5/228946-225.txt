When Zeus was atop Mount Olympus he grew upset with mankind and the sacrifices they were performing on one another . Furiously , he decided it would be smart to wipe out mankind with a gigantic flood using the help of his brother Poseidon , King of the Seas . Killing every human except Deucalion and Pyrrha , Zeus flooded the entire planet but then realized he then had to restore society with new people . After clearing all the water , he had Deucalion and Pyrrah create humans to repopulate the earth using stones that became humans . These stones represented the `` hardness '' of mankind and the man life . This story has been told different ways and in different time periods between Ancient Greek Mythology and The Bible , although the base of the story remains true .
