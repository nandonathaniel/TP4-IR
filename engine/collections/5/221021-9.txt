In the United States , there are many rules and rights surrounding immediate family members in the wake of a family death . If the will names a non-immediate family member to be the executor of the will , he or she can not have an `` official role in these matters '' . Even if a person is not a joint owner , if they are an immediate family member a bank is likely to give them access to the deceased 's safety deposit box . Some states that enforce no - contest provisions do not enforce them against immediate family members . In some states , the immediate family may receive a family allowance - a court - ordered amount paid to them from estate funds to provide help for living expenses . They may also entitled to homestead allowance - an amount of equity in the family home . In many states , household goods ( sentimental but not expensive goods ) can be passed onto immediate family members without probate .
