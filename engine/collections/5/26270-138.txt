The presidential election process is controversial , with critics arguing that it is inherently undemocratic , and discourages voter participation and turnout in many areas of the country . Because of the staggered nature of the primary season , voters in Iowa , New Hampshire and other small states which traditionally hold their primaries and caucuses first in January usually have a major impact on the races . Campaign activity , media attention , and voter participation are usually higher in these states , as the candidates attempt to build momentum and generate a bandwagon effect in these early primaries . Conversely , voters in California and other large states which traditionally hold their primaries last in June usually end up having no say in who the presidential candidates will be . The races are usually over by then , and thus the campaigns , the media , and voters have little incentive to participate in these late primaries . As a result , more states vie for earlier primaries to claim a greater influence in the process . However , compressing the primary calendar in this way limits the ability of lesser - known candidates to effectively corral resources and raise their visibility among voters , especially when competing with better - known candidates who have more financial resources and the institutional backing of their party 's establishment . Primary and caucus reform proposals include a National Primary held on a single day ; or the Interregional Primary Plan , where states would be grouped into six regions , and each of the regions would rotate every election on who would hold their primaries first .
