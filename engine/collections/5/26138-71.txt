Ronaldo scored his first and only hat - trick for Manchester United in a 6 -- 0 win against Newcastle United on 12 January 2008 , bringing United up to the top of the Premier League table . A month later , on 19 March , he captained United for the first time in a home win over Bolton , and scored both goals of the match . His second goal was his 33rd of the campaign , which bettered George Best 's total of 32 goals in the 1967 -- 68 season , thus setting the club 's new single - season record by a midfielder . Ronaldo scored his final league goal of the season from the penalty spot in the title decider against Wigan on 11 May , as United claimed a second successive Premier League title . His 31 league goals earned him the Premier League Golden Boot , as well as the European Golden Shoe , which made him the first winger to win the latter award .
