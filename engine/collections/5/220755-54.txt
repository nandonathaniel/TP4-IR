In President Adams ' first message to Congress , he advocated not only the construction of roads and canals but also the establishment of observatories and a national university . President Jefferson had recommended many of these in 1806 for Congress to consider for creation of necessary amendments to the Constitution . Adams seemed oblivious to the limitations of the Constitution . In much alarm , Jefferson suggested to Madison the desirability of having Virginia adopt a new set of resolutions , bottomed on those of 1798 , and directed against the acts for internal improvements . In March 1826 , the general assembly declared that all the principles of the earlier resolutions applied `` with full force against the powers assumed by Congress '' in passing acts to protect manufacturers and to further internal improvements . That the administration would meet with opposition in Congress was a foregone conclusion .
