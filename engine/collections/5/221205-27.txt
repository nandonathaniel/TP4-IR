Early episodes of the series featured references by Robin of Mark possibly having a crush on Vanessa , though that was mostly de-emphasized . Near the end of season four , he and Vanessa became a couple . Almost as quickly as they started dating , they became engaged . Midway through the first season , Tyler Foster ( Marquise Wilson ) was introduced as Mark 's annoying neighbor kid ; he would become a regular character starting in season two . By the second season , Robin was phased out after Lewis 's departure . Mark 's cousin from Georgia , Geneva Lee ( Saundra Quarterman ) and her daughter Nicole ( Raven - Symon√© ) moved into the house . Tyler quickly became the best friend of Nicole .
