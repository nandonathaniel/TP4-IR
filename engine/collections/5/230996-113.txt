Bronn takes Jaime to the Red Keep cellars under the pretense of training him ; however , this is a ruse to allow Tyrion ( who is now Hand to Daenerys ) to speak with Jaime . Tyrion suggests a ceasefire so that Westeros can fight the threat posed by the White Walkers instead and proposes a meeting between Daenerys and Cersei so Jon Snow can present evidence of their existence . Jaime is apparently convinced by Tyrion and relays the message to Cersei . Cersei is skeptical , but remains adamant that the Lannisters will prevail against any foe . She also reveals that she is pregnant with Jaime 's child .
