In 2009 , Ryanair abolished airport check - in and replaced it with a fast bag drop for those passengers checking in bags . The option of checking in at the airport for € 10 has been discontinued , and all passengers are required to check in online and print their own boarding pass . Passengers arriving at the airport without a pre-printed online check - in will have to pay € 45 / £ 45 for their boarding pass to be re-issued , whilst customers unable to check in luggage online are asked to pay a fee which varies depending on where they are traveling to at the airport ( as of June 2012 ) . Ryanair faced criticism over the ambiguous nature of these changes .
