The Environment Agency is the principal flood risk management operating authority . It has the power ( but not the legal obligation ) to manage flood risk from designated main rivers and the sea . These functions in relation to other rivers ( defined as ordinary watercourses ) in England are undertaken by Local Authorities or internal drainage boards . The Environment Agency is also responsible for increasing public awareness of flood risk , flood forecasting and warning and has a general supervisory duty for flood risk management . As of 2008 the Environment Agency also has a strategic overview role for all flood and coastal erosion risk management . The term `` Flood Risk Management '' in place of `` Flood Defence '' recognises that managed flooding is essential to meet the requirements of a sustainable flood strategy . It is often not economically feasible or even desirable to prevent all forms of flooding in all locations , and so the Environment Agency uses its powers to reduce either the likelihood or consequences of flooding .
