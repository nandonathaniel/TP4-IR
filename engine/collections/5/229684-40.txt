Over the next several decades , the mission complex expanded to cover 3 acres ( 1.2 ha ) . The first permanent building was likely the two - story , L - shaped stone residence for the priests . The building served as parts of the west and south edges of an inner courtyard . A series of adobe barracks buildings were constructed to house the mission Indians and a textile workshop was erected . By 1744 , over 300 Indian converts resided at San Antonio de Valero . The mission was largely self - sufficient , relying on its 2000 head of cattle and 1300 sheep for food and clothing . Each year , the mission 's farmland produced up to 2000 bushels of corn and 100 bushels of bean ; cotton was also grown .
