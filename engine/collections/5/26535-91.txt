A study conducted by Dube in 2013 , showed that the passing of the FAWB in 1994 had an insignificant impact on violent crime in Mexico , while the expiration of the FAWB in 2004 combined with political instability was correlated with an increase in gun - related homicides among Mexican municipalities near the border . Also in 2013 , Koper reviewed the literature on the ban 's effects and concluded that its effects on crimes committed with assault weapons were mixed due to its various loopholes . He also concluded that the ban did not seem to affect gun crime rates , but may have been able to reduce shootings if it had been renewed in 2004 .
