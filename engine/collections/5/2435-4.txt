The essence of utang na loob is an obligation to appropriately repay a person who has done one a favor . The favors which elicit the Filipino 's sense of utang na loob are typically those whose value is impossible to quantify , or , if there is a quantifiable value involved , involves a deeply personal internal dimension . This internal dimension , loob , differentiates utang na loob from an ordinary utang ( debt ) ; being an internal phenomenon , utang na loob thus goes much deeper than ordinary debt or even the western concept of owing a favor . Filipino psychology explains that this is a reflection of the kapwa orientation of shared personhood or shared self , which is at the core of the Filipino values system .
