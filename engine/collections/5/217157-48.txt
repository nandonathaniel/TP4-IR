A balanced armature is a sound transducer design primarily intended to increase the electrical efficiency of the element by eliminating the stress on the diaphragm characteristic of many other magnetic transducer systems . As shown schematically in the first diagram , it consists of a moving magnetic armature that is pivoted so it can move in the field of the permanent magnet . When precisely centered in the magnetic field there is no net force on the armature , hence the term ' balanced . ' As illustrated in the second diagram , when there is electric current through the coil , it magnetizes the armature one way or the other , causing it to rotate slightly one way or the other about the pivot thus moving the diaphragm to make sound .
