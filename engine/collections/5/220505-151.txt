Some Irish Americans were enthusiastic supporters of Irish independence ; the Fenian Brotherhood movement was based in the United States and in the late 1860s launched several unsuccessful attacks on British - controlled Canada known as the `` Fenian Raids '' . The Provisional IRA received significant funding and volunteers for its paramilitary activities from Irish expatriates and Irish American supporters -- in 1984 , the US Department of Justice won a court case forcing the Irish American fund - raising organization NORAID to acknowledge the Provisional IRA as its `` foreign principal '' .
