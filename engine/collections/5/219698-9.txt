In December 1949 the Security Council asked its Canadian President General McNaughton to meet both sides for a solution . McNaughton forwarded his proposals to both Governments on 22 December and reported to the Security Council on 29 December , before his term as President of the Security Council expired on the 31st . Nevertheless , he continued his mediatory activities at the Council 's request and submitted a final report on 3 February 1950 .
