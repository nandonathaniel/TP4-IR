As mentioned above , it has been suggested that King `` Aduluald '' in the letter to Justus is a real king Æthelwald , perhaps a junior king of west Kent . In that case it would appear that Laurence converted Eadbald , and Justus converted Æthelwald . It has also been suggested that the pallium did not indicate Justus was archbishop , since Justus is told the limited circumstances in which he may wear it ; however , the same phrasing occurs in the letter conveying the pallium to Archbishop Augustine , also quoted in Bede . Another possibility is that the letter was originally two letters . In this view , Bede has conflated the letter conveying the pallium with the letter congratulating Justus on the conversion , which according to Bede 's account was seven or so years earlier ; but the grammatical details on which this suggestion is based are not unique to this letter , and as a result it is usually considered to be a single composition .
