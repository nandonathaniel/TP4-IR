Today the IWW remains active in the country with branches in Vancouver , Vancouver Island , Edmonton , Winnipeg , Ottawa / Outaouais , Toronto , Windsor , Sherbrooke , Québec City and Montréal . The largest branch is currently in Montréal . In August 2009 , Canadian members voted to ratify the constitution of the Canadian Regional Organizing Committee ( CanROC ) to improve inter-branch coordination and communication . Affiliated branches are Winnipeg , Ottawa - Outaouais , Toronto , Windsor , Sherbrooke , Montréal and Québec City . Each branch elects a representative to make decisions on the Canadian board . There were originally three officers , the Secretary - Treasurer , Organizing Department Liaison , and Editor of the Canadian Organizing Bulletin . In 2016 , CanROC members voted to split the Secretary - Treasurer role into separate Regional Secretary and Regional Treasurer positions .
