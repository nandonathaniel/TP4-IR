After initial dismay and anger , he gives his blessing to his daughter Sybil 's marriage to family chauffeur Tom Branson and goes along with Tom and Matthew 's plan to modernise Downton in Series 3 . Tom , despite his republican beliefs and disdain for the aristocracy , once described his father - in - law as `` a good man and a decent employer '' .
