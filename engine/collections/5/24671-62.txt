Signals were originally controlled by levers situated at the signals , and later by levers grouped together and connected to the signal by wire cables , or pipes supported on rollers ( US ) . Often these levers were placed in a special building , known as a signal box ( UK ) or interlocking tower ( US ) , and eventually they were mechanically interlocked to prevent the display of a signal contrary to the alignment of the switch points . Automatic traffic control systems added track circuits to detect the presence of trains and alter signal aspects to reflect their presence or absence .
