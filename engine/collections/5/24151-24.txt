The bowl system began in 1902 with the first ever East - West game in Pasadena , California , held at Tournament Park on New Year 's Day in conjunction with the Tournament of Roses parade . This game was an exhibition game pitting a highly rated team from the west coast against a team from east of the Mississippi River . This was an ideal time for a postseason game , as fans could take off work or school during this holiday period to travel to the game . In the first game , the University of Michigan Wolverines represented the east and easily defeated the west 's representative Stanford by a score of 49 -- 0 . Due to the lopsided victory the game did not resume until 1916 .
