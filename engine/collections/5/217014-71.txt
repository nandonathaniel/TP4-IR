Heracles was the greatest of Hellenic chthonic heroes , but unlike other Greek heroes , no tomb was identified as his . Heracles was both hero and god , as Pindar says heroes theos ; at the same festival sacrifice was made to him , first as a hero , with a chthonic libation , and then as a god , upon an altar : thus he embodies the closest Greek approach to a `` demi - god '' . The core of the story of Heracles has been identified by Walter Burkert as originating in Neolithic hunter culture and traditions of shamanistic crossings into the netherworld .
