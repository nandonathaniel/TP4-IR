Smallpox epidemics in 1780 -- 1782 and 1837 -- 1838 brought devastation and drastic depopulation among the Plains Indians . By 1832 , the federal government established a smallpox vaccination program for Native Americans ( The Indian Vaccination Act of 1832 ) . It was the first federal program created to address a health problem of Native Americans .
