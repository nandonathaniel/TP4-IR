... I think it may be called the finest thing in Australasian history . It was a revolution -- small in size ; but great politically ; it was a strike for liberty , a struggle for principle , a stand against injustice and oppression ... It is another instance of a victory won by a lost battle . It adds an honorable page to history ; the people know it and are proud of it . They keep green the memory of the men who fell at the Eureka stockade , and Peter Lalor has his monument .
