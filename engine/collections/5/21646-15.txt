Polyamides can also be synthesized from dinitriles using acid catalysis via an application of the Ritter reaction . This method is applicable for preparation of nylon 1 , 6 from adiponitrile , formaldehyde and water . Additionally , polyamides can be synthesized from glycols and dinitriles using this method as well .
