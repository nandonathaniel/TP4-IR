EBV can be divided into two major types , EBV type 1 and EBV type 2 . These two subtypes have different EBNA - 3 genes . As a result , the two subtypes differ in their transforming capabilities and reactivation ability . Type 1 is dominant throughout most of the world , but the two types are equally prevalent in Africa . One can distinguish EBV type 1 from EBV type 2 by cutting the viral genome with a restriction enzyme and comparing the resulting digestion patterns by gel electrophoresis .
