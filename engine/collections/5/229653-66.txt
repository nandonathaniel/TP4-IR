Since the epidemic is widespread , African governments sometimes relax their laws in order to get research conducted in their countries which they would otherwise not afford . However , global organizations such as the Clinton Foundation , are working to reduce the cost of HIV / AIDS medications in Africa and elsewhere . For example , the philanthropist Inder Singh oversaw a program which reduced the cost of pediatric HIV / AIDS drugs by between 80 and 92 percent by working with manufacturers to reduce production and distribution costs . Manufacturers often cite distribution and production difficulties in developing markets , which create a substantial barrier to entry .
