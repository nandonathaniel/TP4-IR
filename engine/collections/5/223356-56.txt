Simpson 's paradox can also be illustrated using the 2 - dimensional vector space . A success rate of p q ( \ displaystyle \ textstyle ( \ frac ( p ) ( q ) ) ) ( i.e. , successes / attempts ) can be represented by a vector A â†’ = ( q , p ) ( \ displaystyle ( \ overrightarrow ( A ) ) = ( q , p ) ) , with a slope of p q ( \ displaystyle \ textstyle ( \ frac ( p ) ( q ) ) ) . A larger slope , meaning a steeper vector direction , represents then a more successful week . If two rates p 1 q 1 ( \ displaystyle \ textstyle ( \ frac ( p_ ( 1 ) ) ( q_ ( 1 ) ) ) ) and p 2 q 2 ( \ displaystyle \ textstyle ( \ frac ( p_ ( 2 ) ) ( q_ ( 2 ) ) ) ) are combined , as in the examples given above , the result can be represented by the sum of the vectors ( q 1 , p 1 ) ( \ displaystyle ( q_ ( 1 ) , p_ ( 1 ) ) ) and ( q 2 , p 2 ) ( \ displaystyle ( q_ ( 2 ) , p_ ( 2 ) ) ) , which according to the parallelogram rule is the vector ( q 1 + q 2 , p 1 + p 2 ) ( \ displaystyle ( q_ ( 1 ) + q_ ( 2 ) , p_ ( 1 ) + p_ ( 2 ) ) ) , with slope p 1 + p 2 q 1 + q 2 ( \ displaystyle \ textstyle ( \ frac ( p_ ( 1 ) + p_ ( 2 ) ) ( q_ ( 1 ) + q_ ( 2 ) ) ) ) .
