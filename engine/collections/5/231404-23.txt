British bombing policy evolved during the war . In the beginning , the RAF was forbidden to attack targets in Germany due to the risk of accidental civilian casualties . Following a German attack on military targets in the Orkney Islands on 16 March 1940 that killed a civilian , the RAF mounted its first attack against a German land target , the seaplane base on the island of Sylt . The RAF began attacking transport targets west of the Rhine on the night of 10 May following the German invasion of the Low Countries , and military targets in the rest of Germany after the bombing of Rotterdam . On 9 September 1940 RAF crews were instructed that due to the `` indiscriminate '' nature of German bombing , if they failed to find their assigned targets they were to attack targets of opportunity rather than bring their bombs home . On the 15 / 16 December the RAF carried out its first area bombing attack ( destroying 45 % of the city of Mannheim ) , officially in response to the raid on Coventry . The bombing of Mannheim has often been described as the first deliberate `` terror bombing '' of the war .
