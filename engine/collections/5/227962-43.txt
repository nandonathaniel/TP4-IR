Giorgio de Chirico , and his previous development of metaphysical art , was one of the important joining figures between the philosophical and visual aspects of Surrealism . Between 1911 and 1917 , he adopted an unornamented depictional style whose surface would be adopted by others later . The Red Tower ( La tour rouge ) from 1913 shows the stark colour contrasts and illustrative style later adopted by Surrealist painters . His 1914 The Nostalgia of the Poet ( La Nostalgie du poète ) has the figure turned away from the viewer , and the juxtaposition of a bust with glasses and a fish as a relief defies conventional explanation . He was also a writer whose novel Hebdomeros presents a series of dreamscapes with an unusual use of punctuation , syntax , and grammar designed to create an atmosphere and frame its images . His images , including set designs for the Ballets Russes , would create a decorative form of Surrealism , and he would be an influence on the two artists who would be even more closely associated with Surrealism in the public mind : Dalí and Magritte . He would , however , leave the Surrealist group in 1928 .
