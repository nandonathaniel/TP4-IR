On 19 February 2007 Disney lost a court case in Los Angeles which ruled their `` misguided claims '' to dispute the licensing agreements with Slesinger , Inc. were unjustified , but a federal ruling of 28 September 2009 , again from Judge Florence - Marie Cooper , determined that the Slesinger family had granted all trademark and copyright rights to Disney , although Disney must pay royalties for all future use of the characters . Both parties have expressed satisfaction with the outcome .
