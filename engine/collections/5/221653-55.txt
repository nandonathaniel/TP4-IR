English is sometimes described as having a future tense , although since future time is not specifically expressed by verb inflection , some grammarians identify only two tenses ( present or present - future , and past ) . The English `` future '' usually refers to a periphrastic form involving the auxiliary verb will ( or sometimes shall when used with a first - person subject ; see shall and will ) . There also exist other ways of referring to future circumstances , including the going to construction , and the use of present tense forms ( see above ) . For particular grammatical contexts where the present tense substitutes for the future , see conditional sentences and dependent clauses below . For discussion and comparison of the various ways of making future reference in English , see going - to future .
