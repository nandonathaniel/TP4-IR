Many critics of the system , both conservative and liberal , would like to see the MPAA ratings unveiled and the standards made public . The MPAA has consistently cited nationwide scientific polls ( conducted each year by the Opinion Research Corporation of Princeton , New Jersey ) , which show that parents find the ratings useful . Critics such as Matt Stone in Kirby Dick 's documentary This Film is not Yet Rated respond this proves only that parents find the ratings more useful than nothing at all . In the film , it is also discussed how the MPAA will not reveal any information about how or why certain decisions are made , and that the association will not even reveal to the filmmaker the specific scenes that need to be cut in order to get an alternative rating .
