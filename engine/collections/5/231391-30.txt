In the manga , this form appears more frequently and receives more explanation . It is the name given to her by her parents so she often uses this to identify herself in the future . The only other character to use it , besides the royal family and its friends and allies , is Diana , who periodically calls her by Small Lady and uses honorific endings to indicate that Chibiusa is a princess . Her princess form also appears in Artbooks IV and the Materials Collection , in which she is drawn among the other Sailor Soldiers in their specific gowns . She wears a light pink gown unique from all the others .
