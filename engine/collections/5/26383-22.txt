The poop deck was above the cabin of Master Jones , on the ship 's highest level above the stern on the aft castle . The poop house was on this deck , which may have been for passengers ' use either for sleeping or cargo . On normal merchant ships , this space was probably a chart room or a cabin for the master 's mates .
