Successful blocking does not always result in a `` roof '' and many times does not even touch the ball . While it 's obvious that a block was a success when the attacker is roofed , a block that consistently forces the attacker away from his or her ' power ' or preferred attack into a more easily controlled shot by the defense is also a highly successful block .
