Reconstructions of the provinces and provincial capitals during this period partially rely on ecclesiastical records . On the assumption that the early bishoprics mimicked the imperial hierarchy , scholars use the list of bishops for the 314 Council of Arles . Unfortunately , the list is patently corrupt : the British delegation is given as including a Bishop `` Eborius '' of Eboracum and two bishops `` from Londinium '' ( one de civitate Londinensi and the other de civitate colonia Londinensium ) . The error is variously emended : Bishop Ussher proposed Colonia , Selden Col. or Colon . Camalodun. , and Spelman Colonia Cameloduni ( all various names of Colchester ) ; Gale and Bingham offered colonia Lindi and Henry Colonia Lindum ( both Lincoln ) ; and Bishop Stillingfleet and Francis Thackeray read it as a scribal error of Civ . Col. Londin . for an original Civ . Col. Leg. II ( Caerleon ) . On the basis of the Verona List , the priest and deacon who accompanied the bishops in some manuscripts are ascribed to the fourth province .
