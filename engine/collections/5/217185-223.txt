After the defeat by the Japanese , a number of Allied personnel retreated into the jungle . Some joined the MPAJA and others , such as Freddie Spencer Chapman , were Force 136 operatives who sought to begin a sabotage campaign against the occupying Japanese forces . In August 1943 the Allies set up South East Asia Command to oversee the war in South East Asia , including Malaya . As the war progressed further Allied operatives were landed either from submarine or be parachuted in to provide assistance to the resistance movements .
