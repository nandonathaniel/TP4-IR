Gerald Ford took over as U.S. president on 9 August 1974 after President Nixon resigned due to the Watergate scandal . At this time , Congress cut financial aid to South Vietnam from $1 billion a year to $700 million . The U.S. midterm elections in 1974 brought in a new Congress dominated by Democrats who were even more determined to confront the president on the war . Congress immediately voted in restrictions on funding and military activities to be phased in through 1975 and to culminate in a total cutoff of funding in 1976 .
