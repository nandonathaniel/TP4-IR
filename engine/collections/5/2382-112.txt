Three main aspects to the priesthood : offering the Eucharist , hearing confessions , and counseling . Whilst continuing to hold the importance of these three aspects of priesthood , the church now has a significantly broader understanding . Priests are also responsible for daily recitation of the principal and minor offices of the Liturgy of the Hours . Priests are the only ministers of the Sacrament of Penance and Anointing of the Sick . They are the ordinary ministers of Baptism and witnesses to Holy Matrimony .
