Josquin 's fame lasted throughout the 16th century , and indeed increased for several decades after his death . Zarlino , writing in the 1580s , was still using examples from Josquin in his treatises on composition ; and Josquin 's fame was only eclipsed after the beginning of the Baroque era , with the decline of the pre-tonal polyphonic style . During the 18th and 19th centuries Josquin 's fame was overshadowed by later Roman School composer Palestrina , whose music was seen as the summit of polyphonic refinement , and codified into a system of composition by theorists such as Johann Fux ; however , during the 20th century , Josquin 's reputation has grown steadily , to the point where scholars again consider him `` the greatest and most successful composer of the age . '' According to Richard Sherr , writing in the introduction to the Josquin Companion , addressing specifically the shrinking of Josquin 's canon due to correction of misattributions , `` Josquin will survive because his best music really is as magnificent as everybody has always said it was .
