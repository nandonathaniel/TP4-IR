American political campaigns have become heavily reliant on broadcast media and direct mail advertising ( typically designed and purchased through specialized consultants ) . Though virtually all campaign media are sometimes used at all levels ( even candidates for local office have been known to purchase cable TV ads ) , smaller , lower - budget campaigns are typically more focused on direct mail , low - cost advertising ( such as lawn signs ) , and direct voter contact . This reliance on expensive advertising is a leading factor behind the rise in the cost of running for office in the United States . This rising cost is considered by some to discourage those without well - monied connections , or money themselves , from running for office .
