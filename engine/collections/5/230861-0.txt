Convergent evolution -- the repeated evolution of similar traits in multiple lineages which all ancestrally lack the trait -- is rife in nature , as illustrated by the examples below . The ultimate cause of convergence is usually a similar evolutionary biome , as similar environments will select for similar traits in any species occupying the same ecological niche , even if those species are only distantly related . In the case of cryptic species , it can create species which are only distinguishable by analysing their genetics . Unrelated organisms often develop analogous structures by adapting to similar environments .
