`` So what Andrew Oldham did was lock us up in the kitchen for a night and say , ' Do n't come out without a song . ' We sat around and came up with ' As Tears Go By ' . It was unlike most Rolling Stones material , but that 's what happens when you write songs , you immediately fly to some other realm . The weird thing is that Andrew found Marianne Faithfull at the same time , bunged it to her and it was a fuckin ' hit for her -- we were songwriters already ! But it took the rest of that year to dare to write anything for the Stones . ''
