The phrase `` Bye , Felicia '' ( actually spelled `` Felisha '' in the cast listing ) came from a scene in the American stoner buddy crime comedy film Friday ( 1995 ) . According to Ice Cube , who starred in the film and co-wrote its script , `` Bye , Felicia '' is `` the phrase ' to get anyone out of your face ' , '' and , as it was used in the Friday scene , is generally intended as a dismissive kiss - off .
