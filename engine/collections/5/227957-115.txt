The 19th and early - 20th - century architectural revivals brought about the building of a great number of churches that imitate elements of St Peter 's to a greater or lesser degree , including St. Mary of the Angels in Chicago , St. Josaphat 's Basilica in Milwaukee , Immaculate Heart of Mary in Pittsburgh and Mary , Queen of the World Cathedral in Montreal , which replicates many aspects of St Peter 's on a smaller scale . Post-Modernism has seen free adaptations of St Peter 's in the Basilica of Our Lady of Liche≈Ñ , and the Basilica of Our Lady of Peace of Yamoussoukro .
