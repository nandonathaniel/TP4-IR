Although the term `` boy band '' is mostly associated with groups from the 1990s onwards , the earliest predecessors of this format were groups such as the Jackson 5 and the Osmonds which helped form the template for boy bands . The Jackson 5 were a family group that established many musical conventions that boy bands follow . For instance , their music featured close harmonies from soul music and catchy pop hooks influenced as much as they were by Motown and acts like the Supremes . All members of the band sang , which is a common convention of a boy band , as opposed to having a front man and the rest on instruments ; thus , no one person dominated the stage . Even so , the members conveniently fitted into the convention of having stereotypical personality types ( e.g. Michael Jackson being the `` cute one '' ) .
