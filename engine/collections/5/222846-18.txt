In any case it was moot whether the association of city with dioceses applied to Ireland . A 1331 writ of Edward III is addressed , among others , to `` Civibus civitatis Dublin , -- de Droghda , -- de Waterford , de Cork , -- de Limrik '' implying civitas status for Drogheda . Some credence to the episcopal connection was given by the 1835 Report of the Commissioners into Municipal Corporations in Ireland and the 1846 Parliamentary Gazetteer of Ireland ( see below ) .
