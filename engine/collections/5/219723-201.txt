The Sultan of Oman declared war on Germany on September 10 , 1939 . During the Second World War , Great Britain recognised the strategic importance of Oman 's geographical location by expanding facilities throughout the country . A new airfield was built on Masirah Island , which , from 1943 onwards , housed No. 33 Staging Post . In 1943 , both Masirah and Ras Al - Hadd became Royal Air Force stations in their own right . Units of No. 2925 Squadron of the RAF Regiment guarded these bases while marine craft were based in Oman to perform air sea rescue duties .
