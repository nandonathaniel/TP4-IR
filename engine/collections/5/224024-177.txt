Jethro Tull -- Having trouble getting repeat bookings , the band took to changing their name frequently to continue playing the London club circuit . Band names were often supplied by their booking agents ' staff , one of whom , a history enthusiast , eventually christened them `` Jethro Tull '' after the 18th - century agriculturist . The name stuck because they were using it the first time a club manager liked their show enough to invite them to return .
