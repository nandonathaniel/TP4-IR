A fishing rod is a long , flexible rod used to catch fish . At its simplest , a fishing rod is a simple stick or pole attached to a line ending in a hook ( formerly known as an angle , hence the term angling ) . The length of the rod can vary between 2 and 20 feet ( 0.61 and 6.10 m ) . To entice fish , bait or lures are impaled on one or more hooks attached to the line . The line is generally stored on a reel which reduces tangles and assists in landing a fish .
