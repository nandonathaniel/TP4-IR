Even before Cos 's defeat , Santa Anna had been making plans to retake Texas . In January , he led the `` Army of Operations in Texas '' towards the rebellious territory . At the Rio Grande , the army divided ; Santa Anna led the bulk of the troops toward Bexar , where he laid siege to the Alamo . The remaining troops , under General Jose de Urrea , traveled up the coastline , easily defeating Johnson and Grant at the battles of San Patricio and Agua Dulce . News of these first Mexican victories cheered the Mexican force gathered at Bexar . On March 6 , Santa Anna ordered an assault on the Alamo ; all but a few of the defenders were killed . A woman , the wife of an Alamo defender , her baby , and a slave of an Alamo defender were released to tell Sam Houston what had happened . They were told to say that everyone would either surrender or die . News of the Texan defeat and approach of the Mexican army terrified the settlers ; in an event later known as the Runaway Scrape , settlers , the Texas government , and the remnants of the Texan army under the command of Sam Houston fled east , away from the approaching army . Houston ordered Colonel James Fannin to abandon Goliad and join his retreat . However , Fannin delayed his departure and sent a quarter of his troops to help evacuate the settlers at Refugio . Centralist forces in the area were stronger than the Texans expected at Refugio and defeated them . After receiving word of the defeat , Fannin finally began his retreat . His men were quickly overtaken and surrounded by Mexican soldiers . Fannin fought courageously at the Battle of Coleto , but was forced to surrender . He and his 300 men were taken prisoner , but just days later were executed in the Goliad Massacre .
