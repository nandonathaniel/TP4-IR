Copper lowers the melting point , improves resistance to thermal cycle fatigue , and improves wetting properties of the molten solder . It also slows down the rate of dissolution of copper from the board and part leads in the liquid solder . Forms intermetallic compounds . May promote growth of tin whiskers . Supersaturated ( by about 1 % ) solution of copper in tin may be employed to inhibit dissolution of thin - film under - bump metallization of BGA chips , e.g. as Sn Ag Cu .
