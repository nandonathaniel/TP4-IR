A hypothesis that caste amounts to race has been rejected by some scholars . Ambedkar , for example , wrote that `` The Brahmin of Punjab is racially of the same stock as the Chamar of Punjab . The Caste system does not demarcate racial division . The Caste system is a social division of people of the same race . '' Various sociologists , anthropologists and historians have rejected the racial origins and racial emphasis of caste and consider the idea to be one that has purely political and economic undertones . Beteille writes that `` the Scheduled Castes of India taken together are no more a race than are the Brahmins taken together . Every social group can not be regarded as a race simply because we want to protect it against prejudice and discrimination '' , and that the 2001 Durban conference on racism hosted by the U.N. is `` turning its back on established scientific opinion '' .
