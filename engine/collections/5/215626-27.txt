Sheldon is often described as a stereotypical `` geek '' . He is usually characterized as being extremely intelligent , detail - oriented , eccentric , and occasionally disturbing . Despite his intelligence , he often displays childlike qualities , such as being extremely stubborn and a lack of common sense . It is claimed by Bernadette that the reason Sheldon is sometimes unpleasant is because the part of his brain that tells him it is wrong to be nasty is `` getting a wedgie from the rest of his brain '' , although , in season 8 's `` The Space Probe Disintegration '' , Sheldon tearfully admits to Leonard that he is aware of his peculiarities and how his behavior comes across . The first four episodes of The Big Bang Theory portray Sheldon slightly inconsistently with respect to his later characterization , in which he is depicted as rather witty and sarcastic , and slightly flirtatious towards Penny in the pilot episode : according to Prady , the character `` began to evolve after episode five or so and became his own thing '' .
