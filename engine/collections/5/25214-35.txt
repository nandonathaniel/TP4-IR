Democratic President Roosevelt and especially his Secretary of State Cordell Hull were critical of the Neutrality Acts , fearing that they would restrict the administration 's options to support friendly nations . Even though both the House and Senate had large Democratic majorities throughout these years , there was enough support for the Acts among Democrats ( especially those representing Southern states ) to ensure their passage . Although Congressional support was insufficient to override a presidential veto , Roosevelt felt he could not afford to snub the South and anger public opinion , especially while facing re-election in 1936 and needing Congressional co-operation on domestic issues . With considerable reluctance , the president signed the Neutrality Acts into law .
