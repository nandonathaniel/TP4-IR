In early July 2017 , Israel ′ s defence minister Avigdor Liberman said that while '' the rebels are not our friends , they are all versions of al - Qaida '' , Israel could not allow a man like Assad to remain in power : `` Keeping Assad in power is not in our security interests . As long as he is in power , Iran and Hezbollah will be in Syria . '' He said that Israel had no interest in entering the Syrian civil war , but there were '' red lines '' Israel had set , such as the smuggling of sophisticated weaponry to Hezbollah and Iran ′ a presence on its borders . Later in July 2017 , the Israeli government said it opposed the cease - fire agreement in southern Syria that the United States and Russia had reached a week prior that envisaged establishing de-escalation zones along Syria 's borders with both Jordan and Israel , as that would legalise Iran ′ s presence in Syria .
