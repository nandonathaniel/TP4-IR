The forest covers 10,000 square kilometres ( 3,900 sq mi ) of which about 6,000 square kilometres ( 2,300 sq mi ) are in Bangladesh . It became inscribed as a UNESCO world heritage site in 1997 . The Indian part of Sundarbans is estimated to be about 4,110 square kilometres ( 1,590 sq mi ) , of which about 1,700 square kilometres ( 660 sq mi ) is occupied by waterbodies in the forms of river , canals and creeks of width varying from a few metres to several kilometres .
