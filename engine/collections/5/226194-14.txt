In `` The Rapture '' , Castiel enters Dean 's dreams and arranges a meeting to tell him something important . However , when Sam and Dean go to meet him , they instead find Jimmy , Castiel 's vessel , who claims to have little memory of his life as a vessel . Anna theorizes Castiel must have angered his superiors , prompting him to be taken back to Heaven . When Jimmy is shot at the end of the episode trying to save his family from demons , Castiel returns , taking Jimmy 's daughter as his new vessel . After the demons are killed , a dying Jimmy begs Castiel to take him back as a host so his daughter will not have to go through what he did , and the angel acquiesces . Dean then asks him what he needed to tell him , but Castiel coldly replies his loyalty is to Heaven , not to mankind or to him .
