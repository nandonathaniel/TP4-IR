Founded in 1856 by Henry Johnson as a railroad station called `` Johnson 's Depot '' , Johnson City became a major rail hub for the Southeast , as three railway lines crossed in the downtown area . In the late 19th and early 20th centuries , Johnson City served as headquarters for the narrow gauge East Tennessee and Western North Carolina Railroad ( the ET&WNC , nicknamed `` Tweetsie '' ) and the standard gauge Clinchfield Railroad . Both rail systems featured excursion trips through scenic portions of the Blue Ridge Mountains and were engineering marvels of railway construction . The Southern Railway ( now Norfolk Southern ) also passes through the city .
