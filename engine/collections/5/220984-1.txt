The Roman legions withdrew from Britain in about 410 CE , by which time there is already evidence that groups of Germanic people were living alongside the native Romano - British population , probably as auxiliary troops . Over the next 150 years , a period from which almost no records survive , they were evidently greatly added to by immigration , and began to create a new social structure and culture that spread to control most of Britain , and began to divide it into a number of Anglo - Saxon kingdoms .
