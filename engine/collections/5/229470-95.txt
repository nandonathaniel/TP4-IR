On 9 August 1920 , the British Parliament passed the Restoration of Order in Ireland Act . It replaced the trial by jury by courts - martial by regulation for those areas where IRA activity was prevalent . On 10 December 1920 , martial law was proclaimed in Counties Cork , Kerry , Limerick and Tipperary in Munster ; in January 1921 martial law was extended to the rest of Munster in Counties Clare and Waterford , as well as Counties Kilkenny and Wexford in Leinster . It also suspended all coroners ' courts because of the large number of warrants served on members of the British forces and replaced them with `` military courts of enquiry '' . The powers of military courts - martial were extended to cover the whole population and were empowered to use the death penalty and internment without trial ; Government payments to local governments in Sinn FÃ©in hands were suspended . This act has been interpreted by historians as a choice by Prime Minister David Lloyd George to put down the rebellion in Ireland rather than negotiate with the republican leadership . As a result , violence escalated steadily from that summer and sharply after November 1920 until July 1921 . ( It was in this period that a mutiny broke out among the Connaught Rangers , stationed in India . Two were killed whilst trying to storm an armoury and one was later executed . )
