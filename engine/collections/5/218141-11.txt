After being diagnosed with leukemia from the radiation , Sadako 's friend told her to fold origami paper cranes in hope of making a thousand of them . She was inspired to do so by the Japanese legend that one who created a thousand origami cranes would be granted a wish . Her wish was simply to live . In this retelling of her story , she managed to fold only 644 cranes before she became too weak to fold any more , and died on the morning of October 25 , 1955 . Her friends and family helped finish her dream by folding the rest of the cranes , which were buried with Sadako .
