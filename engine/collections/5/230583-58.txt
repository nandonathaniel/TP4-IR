The term potential energy was introduced by the 19th century Scottish engineer and physicist William Rankine , although it has links to Greek philosopher Aristotle 's concept of potentiality . Potential energy is associated with forces that act on a body in a way that the total work done by these forces on the body depends only on the initial and final positions of the body in space . These forces , that are called conservative forces , can be represented at every point in space by vectors expressed as gradients of a certain scalar function called potential .
