Herodotus describes the following story which is relevant to the olive wreath . Xerxes was interrogating some Arcadians after the Battle of Thermopylae . He inquired why there were so few Greek men defending Thermopylae . The answer was `` All other men are participating in the Olympic Games '' . And when asked `` What is the prize for the winner ? '' , `` An olive - wreath '' came the answer . Then Tigranes , one of his generals uttered a most noble saying : `` Good heavens ! Mardonius , what kind of men are these against whom you have brought us to fight ? Men who do not compete for possessions , but for honour . ''
