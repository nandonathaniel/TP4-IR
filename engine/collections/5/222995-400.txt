Red is one of the most common colors used on national flags . The use of red has similar connotations from country to country : the blood , sacrifice , and courage of those who defended their country ; the sun and the hope and warmth it brings ; and the sacrifice of Christ 's blood ( in some historically Christian nations ) are a few examples . Red is the color of the flags of several countries that once belonged to the British Empire . The British flag bears the colors red , white and blue ; it includes the cross of Saint George , patron saint of England , and the saltire of Saint Patrick , patron saint of Ireland , both of which are red on white . The flag of the United States bears the colors of Britain , the colors of the French tricolore include red as part of the old Paris coat of arms , and other countries ' flags , such as those of Australia , New Zealand , and Fiji , carry a small inset of the British flag in memory of their ties to that country . Many former colonies of Spain , such as Mexico , Colombia , Costa Rica , Cuba , Ecuador , Panama , Peru , Puerto Rico and Venezuela , also feature red - one of the colors of the Spanish flag - on their own banners . Red flags are also used to symbolize storms , bad water conditions , and many other dangers . Navy flags are often red and yellow . Red is prominently featured in the flag of the United States Marine Corps .
