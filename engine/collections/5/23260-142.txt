Atmospheric tides are negligible at ground level and aviation altitudes , masked by weather 's much more important effects . Atmospheric tides are both gravitational and thermal in origin and are the dominant dynamics from about 80 to 120 kilometres ( 50 to 75 mi ) , above which the molecular density becomes too low to support fluid behavior .
