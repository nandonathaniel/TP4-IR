In the 1980s , the children 's area of the festival ( which had been organised by Arabella Churchill and others ) became the starting point for a new children 's charity called Children 's World . 1981 was the first year that the festival made profits , and Eavis donated Â£ 20,000 of them to CND . In the following years , donations were made to a number of organisations , and since the end of the Cold War the main beneficiaries have been Oxfam , Greenpeace and WaterAid , who all contribute towards the festival by providing features and volunteers , who work at the festival in exchange for free entry .
