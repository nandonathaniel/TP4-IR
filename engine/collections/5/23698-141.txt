Visible remains of the historic line are still easily located -- hundreds of miles are still in service today , especially through the Sierra Nevada Mountains and canyons in Utah and Wyoming . While the original rail has long since been replaced because of age and wear , and the roadbed upgraded and repaired , the lines generally run on top of the original , handmade grade . Vista points on Interstate 80 through California 's Truckee Canyon provide a panoramic view of many miles of the original Central Pacific line and of the snow sheds which made winter train travel safe and practical .
