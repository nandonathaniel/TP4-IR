According to its own ruling , the Convention elected its President every fortnight , and the outgoing President was eligible for re-election after the lapse of a fortnight . Ordinarily the sessions were held in the morning , but evening sessions also occurred frequently , often extending late into the night . Sometimes in exceptional circumstances , the Convention declared itself in permanent session and sat for several days without interruption . For both legislative and administrative the Convention used committees , with powers more or less widely extended and regulated by successive laws . The most famous of these committees included the Committee of Public Safety and the Committee of General Security .
