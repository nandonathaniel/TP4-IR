Hiko Yoshida ( voiced by Sandra Oh ) -- Toshi and Akiko 's mother and one of the few recurring members of the Yoshida family . She asks Steve to take Akiko trick - or - treating in `` Best Little Horror House in Langley Falls '' , following an argument with Toshi over his refusal to wear the Samurai costume she bought him . Though she speaks perfect English , and in `` Spelling bee My Baby '' even admits to not knowing how to speak Japanese , Francine claims not to understand her in `` Weiner of Our Discontent '' due to a disagreement between the pair , Francine mockingly asking if anyone spoke `` sushi hostess '' . In the episode `` Spelling Bee My Baby '' , she 's presented as a tiger parent who forces her will on her children . This brings out Francine 's ultra-wicked side and the two engage in a bitter rivalry at the expense of Steve and Akiko .
