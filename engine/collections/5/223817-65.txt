Around that time , Fulani people , invading from the west , were able to make major inroads into Bornu . By the early 19th century , Kanem - Bornu was clearly an empire in decline , and in 1808 Fulani warriors conquered Ngazargamu . Usman dan Fodio led the Fulani thrust and proclaimed a holy war ( the Fulani War ) on the allegedly irreligious Muslims of the area . His campaign eventually affected Kanem - Bornu and inspired a trend toward Islamic orthodoxy , but a Muslim scholar - turned - statesman , Muhammad al - Amin al - Kanemi , contested the Fulani advance .
