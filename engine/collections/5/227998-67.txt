Lauren Weisberger , a former Wintour assistant who left Vogue for Departures along with Richard Story , wrote The Devil Wears Prada after a writing workshop he suggested she take . It was eagerly anticipated for its supposed insider portrait of Wintour prior to its publication . Wintour told The New York Times , `` I always enjoy a great piece of fiction . I have n't decided whether I am going to read it or not . '' While it has been suggested that the setting and Miranda Priestly were based on Vogue and Wintour , Weisberger claims she drew not only from her own experiences but those of her friends as well . Wintour herself makes a cameo appearance near the end of the book , where it is said she and Miranda dislike each other .
