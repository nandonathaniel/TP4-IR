Retribution -- Criminals ought to Be Punished in some way . This is the most widely seen goal . Criminals have taken improper advantage , or inflicted unfair detriment , upon others and consequently , the criminal law will put criminals at some unpleasant disadvantage to `` balance the scales . '' People submit to the law to receive the right not to be murdered and if people contravene these laws , they surrender the rights granted to them by the law . Thus , one who murders may be executed himself . A related theory includes the idea of `` righting the balance . '' Deterrence -- Individual deterrence is aimed toward the specific offender . The aim is to impose a sufficient penalty to discourage the offender from criminal behavior . General deterrence aims at society at large . By imposing a penalty on those who commit offenses , other individuals are discouraged from committing those offenses . Incapacitation -- Designed simply to keep criminals away from society so that the public is protected from their misconduct . This is often achieved through prison sentences today . The death penalty or banishment have served the same purpose . Rehabilitation -- Aims at transforming an offender into a valuable member of society . Its primary goal is to prevent further offense by convincing the offender that their conduct was wrong . Restoration -- This is a victim - oriented theory of punishment . The goal is to repair , through state authority , any injury inflicted upon the victim by the offender . For example , one who embezzles will be required to repay the amount improperly acquired . Restoration is commonly combined with other main goals of criminal justice and is closely related to concepts in the civil law , i.e. , returning the victim to his or her original position before the injury .
