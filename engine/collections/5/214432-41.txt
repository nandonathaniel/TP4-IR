Tom , who believes that Bethany possesses a great surfer 's instinct for sensing when the best waves will form , rigs a handle on her surfboard which she can use to prevent falling off while paddling out to the waves , which is not prohibited by the competition 's rules . Bethany trains for the competition while rekindling her friendship with Alana . She enters the national championship . During the competition , she performs respectably , though she is still chasing third place . Suddenly , with only minutes left on the clock , the waves die down and all the surfers can only loiter , waiting for the waves to start back up . Tom 's belief in his daughter 's instinct is proven when she is the only one to sense a big wave forming , and she alone paddles out . When it forms , the others can not get out in time and she catches it just as the horn sounds . If it is in time , she will win , but the judges rule that the time has expired . Malina is the winner , but she has finally gotten over her differences with Bethany , inviting her up on the platform to share first place .
