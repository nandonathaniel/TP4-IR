The series , and particularly the live - action Apes television show and the Return to the Planet of the Apes cartoon , generated numerous toy and merchandising tie - ins . During the 1970s , Fox licensed around 60 companies to produce about 300 different Apes products , including action figures and playsets , model building kits , coloring books , book - and - record sets , trading cards , toy weapons , costumes , apparel , branded tableware , and lunch boxes . This level of merchandising was unusual for the time , and the success of Apes merchandise may have inspired the campaigns that later became commonplace for films and television series . The action figures , sold by Mego beginning in 1973 , were the first such toys sold as film tie - ins ; they proved popular and inspired the rise of action figure series based on popular culture franchises . Eric Greene writes that Apes toys were popular enough to lead some contemporary children to engage in apes - vs. - humans role - playing make believe games that simulated the series ' conflicts in a manner similar to `` Cowboys and Indians '' . With the release of the 21st - century films , Fox licensed several companies to manufacture new Apes toys , including detailed action figures of new and `` classic '' characters sold as collectibles .
