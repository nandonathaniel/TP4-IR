An alternative theory , first suggested in 1882 by Ignatius L. Donnelly in Ragnarok : The Age of Fire and Gravel , is that the fire was caused by a meteor shower . At a 2004 conference of the Aerospace Corporation and the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics , engineer and physicist Robert Wood suggested that the fire began when Biela 's Comet broke up over the Midwest . That four large fires took place , all on the same day , all on the shores of Lake Michigan ( see Related Events ) , suggests a common root cause . Eyewitnesses reported sighting spontaneous ignitions , lack of smoke , `` balls of fire '' falling from the sky , and blue flames . According to Wood , these accounts suggest that the fires were caused by the methane that is commonly found in comets .
