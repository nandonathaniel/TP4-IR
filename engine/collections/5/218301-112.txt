King Alfred was driven to seek refuge from the Danes at Athelney before defeating them in 878 at the Battle of Ethandun , usually considered to be near Edington , Wiltshire , but possibly the village of Edington in Somerset . Alfred established a series of forts and lookout posts linked by a military road , or Herepath , to allow his army to cover Viking movements at sea . The Herepath has a characteristic form which is familiar on the Quantocks : a regulation 20 m wide track between avenues of trees growing from hedge laying embankments . A peace treaty with the Danes was signed at Wedmore and the Danish king Guthrum the Old was baptised at Aller . Burhs ( fortified places ) had been set up by 919 , such as Lyng . The Alfred Jewel , an object about 2.5 - inch ( 64 mm ) long , made of filigree gold , cloisonn√© - enamelled and with a rock crystal covering , was found in 1693 at Petherton Park , North Petherton . This is believed to have been owned by King Alfred . Monasteries and minster churches were set up all over Somerset , with daughter churches of the minsters in manors . There was a royal palace at Cheddar , which was used at times in the 10th century to host the Witenagemot .
