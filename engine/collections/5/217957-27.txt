The media baron Elliot Carver soon begins his plans to use a stolen encoder obtained at the bazaar by his henchman , cyberterrorist Henry Gupta , to provoke war between China and the United Kingdom ; he hopes to replace the Chinese government with one that will give him exclusive broadcasting rights . Meaconing the GPS signal using the encoder , Gupta sends the British frigate HMS Devonshire off - course into Chinese - held waters in the South China Sea , where Carver 's stealth ship , commanded by Mr. Stamper , sinks it and steals one of its missiles , while shooting down a Chinese J - 7 fighter jet and killing off the Devonshire 's survivors with Chinese weaponry . The British Minister of Defence orders Roebuck to deploy the British Fleet to recover the frigate , and possibly retaliate , while leaving M only 48 hours to investigate its sinking and avert a war .
