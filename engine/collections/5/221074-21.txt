The First Russian Antarctic expedition led by Bellingshausen and Mikhail Lazarev on the 985 - ton sloop - of - war Vostok ( `` East '' ) and the 530 - ton support vessel Mirny ( `` Peaceful '' ) reached a point within 32 km ( 20 mi ) from Queen Maud 's Land and recorded the sight of an ice shelf at 69 ° 21 ′ 28 '' S 2 ° 14 ′ 50 '' W ﻿ / ﻿ 69.35778 ° S 2.24722 ° W ﻿ / - 69.35778 ; - 2.24722 , which became known as the Fimbul ice shelf . This happened three days before Bransfield sighted land , and ten months before Palmer did so in November 1820 . The first documented landing on Antarctica was by the American sealer John Davis , apparently at Hughes Bay , near Cape Charles , in West Antarctica on 7 February 1821 , although some historians dispute this claim . The first recorded and confirmed landing was at Cape Adair in 1895 .
