Roarke signs 30 executive orders in 5 days and removes the Cache from the Internet , leading Owen to realize that the Collaborators are near their endgame . With Clay gone , Alex gets help from Will , Miranda , and Keyes to help understand what Roarke is planning . Will learns that the profit ENGIN made was from Avionics systems , which have since been added to a number of airplanes . The team finds that there is hidden code in the software that allows a plane to be remotely controlled with a smartphone if they have a popular Collaborator - owned app installed . They realize Roarke 's plan : six flights each have one person on Roarke 's Muslim Registry Act , each with the app on their phones ; when their phones connect to the plane 's wi - fi , the Collaborators will use the app to control and crash the planes . Alex goes to Alice to find the flights , while Shelby , with Raina 's sacrifice , finds Clay to learn the FAA 's code to request emergency landing . The team successfully saves the flights . However , Roarke uses the team 's win as an example : he announces that their off - book operation was sanctioned and uses it to request a new Constitutional Convention to rewrite the US Constitution .
