The basic specifications of the music single were set in the late 19th century , when the gramophone record began to supersede phonograph cylinders in commercially produced musical recordings . Gramophone discs were manufactured with a range of playback speeds ( from 16 rpm to 78 rpm ) and in several sizes ( including 12 - inch / 30 cm ) . By about 1910 , however , the 10 - inch ( 25 cm ) , 78 rpm shellac disc had become the most commonly used format .
