Rocinante ( Spanish pronunciation : ( roθiˈnante ) ) is Don Quixote 's horse in the novel Don Quixote by Miguel de Cervantes . In many ways , Rocinante is not only Don Quixote 's horse , but also his double : like Don Quixote , he is awkward , past his prime , and engaged in a task beyond his capacities .
