Disney 's Electrical Parade at Disney California Adventure ended its run on April 18 , 2010 , and was sent to Magic Kingdom as part of the Walt Disney World 2010 promotional package `` Summer Nightastic ! '' The parade was not modified from its Disney California Adventure run , with the drum still saying `` Disney 's Electrical Parade '' .
