In the final year of the war , the Allies prepared for what was anticipated to be a very costly invasion of the Japanese mainland . This was preceded by a U.S. conventional and firebombing campaign that destroyed 67 Japanese cities . The war in Europe had concluded when Nazi Germany signed its instrument of surrender on May 8 , 1945 . The Japanese , facing the same fate , refused to accept the Allies ' demands for unconditional surrender and the Pacific War continued . The Allies called for the unconditional surrender of the Imperial Japanese armed forces in the Potsdam Declaration on July 26 , 1945 -- the alternative being `` prompt and utter destruction '' . The Japanese response to this ultimatum was to ignore it .
