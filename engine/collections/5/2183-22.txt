Thomas `` Tom '' Robinson is an African - American who is put on trial for the rape of a white woman , Mayella Ewell . Atticus is assigned to defend him , and stands up to a lynch mob intent on exacting their own justice against him before the trial begins . Tom 's left arm is crippled and useless , the result of an accident with a cotton gin when he was a child . Atticus uses this fact as the cornerstone of his defense strategy , pointing out that the nature of Mayella 's facial injuries strongly suggest a left - handed assailant . Tom testifies that he had frequently helped Mayella with household chores because he felt sorry for her and the family 's difficult life - a statement that shocks the all - white , male jury . Despite Atticus ' skilled defense , the jury 's racial prejudices lead them to find Tom guilty . Atticus plans to appeal the verdict , but before he can do so , Tom is shot and killed while trying to escape the prison where he is being held . Tom Robinson is played by Brock Peters .
