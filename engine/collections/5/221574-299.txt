The model is commonly applied to wages in the market for labor . The typical roles of supplier and consumer are reversed . The suppliers are individuals , who try to sell ( supply ) their labor for the highest price . The consumers are businesses , which try to buy ( demand ) the type of labor they need at the lowest price . As more people offer their labor in that market , the equilibrium wage decreases and the equilibrium level of employment increases as the supply curve shifts to the right . The opposite happens if fewer people offer their wages in the market as the supply curve shifts to the left .
