Chris Tilly of IGN UK commented on the length of the film , saying `` while on occasion it drags , the 153 - minute run - time never feels too long , thanks in no small part to the astonishing visuals and ( largely ) marvellous performances , '' and goes on to say , `` This is by far the best - looking of the Potter films thus far , '' commending the `` beautiful '' Quidditch match and the `` stunning '' finale . However , Dave Golder of SFX magazine found some aspects of the film to be a disappointment , largely due to the large number of opportunities the director and screenwriter had sacrificed to devote `` huge swathes of the film to subplots of Harry and his chums ' teenage romances , '' but nevertheless found the film to be a large enjoyment , praising the performances of Jim Broadbent and Alan Rickman .
