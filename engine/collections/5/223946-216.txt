In recent decades , states modeled some of their assets and enterprises after business enterprises . In 2003 , for example , the People 's Republic of China modeled 80 % of its state - owned enterprises on a company - type management system . Many state institutions and enterprises in China and Russia have transformed into joint - stock companies , with part of their shares being listed on public stock markets .
