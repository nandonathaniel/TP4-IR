The drummers and the rhythms they played served as accompaniment for dance bands , which played ragtime and various dances , with jazz coming later . It was common in these bands to have two drummers , one playing snare drum , the other bass . Eventually , however , due to various factors ( not the least of which being the financial motivation ) , the number of drummers was reduced to one , and this created the need for a percussionist to play multiple instruments , hence the drum set . The first drum sets also began with military drums , though various other accessories were added later in order to create a larger range of sounds , and also for novelty appeal .
