Located within the thylakoid membrane and the inner mitochondrial membrane , ATP synthase consists of two regions F and F. F causes rotation of F and is made of c - ring and subunits a , b , d , F6. F is made of α , β , γ , δ ( \ displaystyle \ alpha , \ beta , \ gamma , \ delta ) subunits . F has a water soluble par that can hydrolyze ATP . F on the other hand has mainly hydrophobic regions . F F creates a pathway for protons movement across the membrane .
