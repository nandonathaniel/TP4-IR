A river begins at a source ( or more often several sources ) , follows a path called a course , and ends at a mouth or mouths . The water in a river is usually confined to a channel , made up of a stream bed between banks . In larger rivers there is often also a wider floodplain shaped by flood - waters over-topping the channel . Floodplains may be very wide in relation to the size of the river channel . This distinction between river channel and floodplain can be blurred , especially in urban areas where the floodplain of a river channel can become greatly developed by housing and industry .
