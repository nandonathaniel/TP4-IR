On 17 July 1936 , the Spanish Army launched a coup d'état , leading to a prolonged armed conflict between Spanish Republicans ( the elected leftist national government ) and the Nationalists ( conservative , anti-communist rebels who included most officers of the Spanish Army ) . Julio Álvarez del Vayo , the Spanish Minister of Foreign Affairs , appealed to the League in September 1936 for arms to defend Spain 's territorial integrity and political independence . The League members would not intervene in the Spanish Civil War nor prevent foreign intervention in the conflict . Adolf Hitler and Mussolini continued to aid General Francisco Franco 's Nationalists , while the Soviet Union helped the Spanish Republic . In February 1937 , the League did ban foreign volunteers , but this was in practice a symbolic move .
