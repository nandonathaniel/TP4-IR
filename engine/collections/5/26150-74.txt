In a 2012 podcast interview with Marc Maron , comedian Shelley Berman accused Newhart of plagiarizing his improvisational telephone routine style . However , in interviews both years before and after Berman 's comments , Newhart has never taken credit for originating the telephone concept , which he has noted was done earlier by Berman and -- predating Berman -- Nichols and May , George Jessel ( in his well - known sketch `` Hello Mama '' ) , and in the 1913 recording `` Cohen on the Telephone '' . The technique would later also be used by Lily Tomlin , Ellen DeGeneres , and many others .
