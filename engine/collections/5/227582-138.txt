When the election returns were tallied on November 7 , Bush had won 29 states , including Florida . The closeness of the Florida outcome led to a recount . The initial recount also went to Bush , but the outcome was tied up in lower courts for a month until eventually reaching the U.S. Supreme Court . On December 9 , in the controversial Bush v. Gore ruling , the Court reversed a Florida Supreme Court decision that had ordered a third count , and stopped an ordered statewide hand recount based on the argument that the use of different standards among Florida 's counties violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment . The machine recount showed that Bush had won the Florida vote by a margin of 537 votes out of six million cast . Although he had received 543,895 fewer individual nationwide votes than Gore , Bush won the election , receiving 271 electoral votes to Gore 's 266 ( Gore 's statewide victories had electoral votes tallying 267 ; however , one of Gore 's pledged electors abstained , rendering the official tally at 266 ) . Bush was the first person to win an American presidential election with fewer popular votes than another candidate since Benjamin Harrison in 1888 .
