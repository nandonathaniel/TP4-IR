In Canada , the right to silence is protected under section 7 and section 11 ( c ) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms . The accused may not be compelled as a witness against himself in criminal proceedings , and therefore only voluntary statements made to police are admissible as evidence . Prior to an accused being informed of their right to legal counsel , any statements they make to police are considered involuntarily compelled and are inadmissible as evidence . After being informed of the right to counsel , the accused may choose to voluntarily answer questions and those statements would be admissible .
