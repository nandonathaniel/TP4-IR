In April 1969 , Creedence Clearwater Revival became the first act to sign a contract for the event , agreeing to play for $10,000 . The promoters had experienced difficulty landing big - name groups prior to Creedence committing to play . Creedence drummer Doug Clifford later commented , `` Once Creedence signed , everyone else jumped in line and all the other big acts came on . '' Given their 3 a.m. start time and omission from the Woodstock film ( at Creedence frontman John Fogerty 's insistence ) , Creedence members have expressed bitterness over their experiences regarding the festival .
