Under home rule , New Jersey law grants individual municipalities substantial discretion in passing ordinances regulating the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages within their limits . The number of retail licenses available is determined by a municipality 's population , and may be further limited by the town 's governing body . As a result , the availability of alcohol and regulations governing it vary significantly from town to town . A small percentage of municipalities in the state are `` dry towns '' that do not allow alcoholic beverages to be sold , and do not issue retail licenses for bars or restaurants to serve alcohol to patrons . Other towns permit alcohol sales 24 hours a day . Retail licenses tend to be difficult to obtain , and when available are subject to exorbitant prices and fervent competition .
