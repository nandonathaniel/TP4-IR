The Tribhuvan International Airport serving Kathmandu was closed immediately after the quake , but was re-opened later in the day for relief operations and , later , for some commercial flights . It subsequently shut down operations sporadically due to aftershocks , and on 3 May was closed temporarily to the largest planes for fear of runway damage . During strong aftershocks , the airport opened all boarding - lounge exit doors onto the tarmac , allowing travelers who were waiting post security and immigration to flee to the open spaces of the runway tarmac . Many travelers remained outside as planes were delayed and the airport swelled to capacity . The airport facilities suffered damage and there was no running water or operating toilets for travelers waiting in the airport lounges . Few airport workers were at their posts ; most were killed in the earthquake or had to deal with its aftereffects .
