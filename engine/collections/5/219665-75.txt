This was part of the ongoing conflict between Pisa and Florence that Emperor Maximilian vowed to resolve in 1496 . Just as Ludovico Sforza had invited Charles VIII into Italy in 1494 , now in 1496 , he invited Maximilian I of the Holy Roman Empire into Italy to resolve the conflict between Pisa and Florence . In the conflict between the Florentines and the Pisans , Sforza had favored the Pisans . In the eyes of Maximilian I and the Holy Roman Empire , the Pisan War was causing distractions and divisions within the members of the League of Venice . This was weakening the anti-French League and Maximilian sought to strengthen the unity of League by settling this war . The worst thing that Maximilian feared was more French involvement in Italian affairs . However , Ludovico Sforza invited Maximilian I and the Holy Roman Empire into Italy in order to strengthen his own position . When the Florentines heard about Maximilian 's intention of coming to Italy to `` settle '' Florence 's war with Pisa , they were suspicious that the `` settlement '' would be heavily inclined toward Pisa . Thus , the Florentines rejected any attempted settlement of the war by the Emperor until Pisa was back under Florentine control .
