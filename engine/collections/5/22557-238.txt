The Alabama extremist William Lowndes Yancey 's demand for a federal slave code for the territories split the Democratic Party between North and South , which made the election of Lincoln possible . Yancey tried to make his demand for a slave code moderate enough to get Southern support and yet extreme enough to enrage Northerners and split the party . He demanded that the party support a slave code for the territories if later necessary , so that the demand would be conditional enough to win Southern support . His tactic worked , and lower South delegates left the Democratic Convention at Institute Hall in Charleston , South Carolina and walked over to Military Hall . The South Carolina extremist Robert Barnwell Rhett hoped that the lower South would completely break with the Northern Democrats and attend a separate convention at Richmond , Virginia , but lower South delegates gave the national Democrats one last chance at unification by going to the convention at Baltimore , Maryland before the split became permanent . The end result was that John C. Breckinridge became the candidate of the Southern Democrats , and Stephen Douglas became the candidate of the Northern Democrats .
