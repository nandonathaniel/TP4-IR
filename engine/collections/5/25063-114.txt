As for the Russian Orthodox Church , Soviet authorities sought to control it and , in times of national crisis , to exploit it for the regime 's own purposes ; but their ultimate goal was to eliminate it . During the first five years of Soviet power , the Bolsheviks executed 28 Russian Orthodox bishops and over 1,200 Russian Orthodox priests . Many others were imprisoned or exiled . Believers were harassed and persecuted . Most seminaries were closed , and the publication of most religious material was prohibited . By 1941 only 500 churches remained open out of about 54,000 in existence prior to World War I .
