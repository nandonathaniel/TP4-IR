London possessed advanced fire - fighting technology in the form of fire engines , which had been used in earlier large - scale fires . However , unlike the useful firehooks , these large pumps had rarely proved flexible or functional enough to make much difference . Only some of them had wheels ; others were mounted on wheelless sleds . They had to be brought a long way , tended to arrive too late , and had limited reach , with spouts but no delivery hoses .
