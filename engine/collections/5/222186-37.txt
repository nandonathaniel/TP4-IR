In that country be many griffins , more plenty than in any other country . Some men say that they have the body upward as an eagle and beneath as a lion ; and truly they say sooth , that they be of that shape . But one griffin hath the body more great and is more strong than eight lions , of such lions as be on this half , and more great and stronger than an hundred eagles such as we have amongst us . For one griffin there will bear , flying to his nest , a great horse , if he may find him at the point , or two oxen yoked together as they go at the plough . For he hath his talons so long and so large and great upon his feet , as though they were horns of great oxen or of bugles or of kine , so that men make cups of them to drink of . And of their ribs and of the pens of their wings , men make bows , full strong , to shoot with arrows and quarrels .
