When the ice of the last glacial epoch had retreated so far that its front border lay on a northward slope , belonging to the drainage area of the Great Lakes , bodies of water accumulated in front of the ice margin , forming glacio - marginal lakes . The lakes were small at first , and each had its own outlet at the lowest depression of land to the south . As the ice melted further back , neighboring lakes became confluent at the level of the lowest outlet of the group . The outflowing streams grew in the same proportion and eroded a broad channel across the height of land and far down stream , while the lake waters built sand reefs or carved shore cliffs along their margin , and laid down sheets of clay on their floors . All of these features are easily recognized in the prairie region . The present site of Chicago was determined by an Indian portage or carry across the low divide between Lake Michigan and the headwaters of the Illinois River . This divide lies on the floor of the former outlet channel of the glacial Lake Michigan . Corresponding outlets are known for Lake Erie , Lake Huron and Lake Superior . A very large sheet of water , named Lake Agassiz , once overspread a broad till plain in northern Minnesota and North Dakota . The outlet of this glacial lake , called river Warren , eroded a large channel in which the Minnesota River evident today . The Red River of the North flows northward through a plain formerly covered by Lake Agassiz .
