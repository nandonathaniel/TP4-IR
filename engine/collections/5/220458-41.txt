Paul W. Downs as Trey Pucker -- Abbi 's boss at Soulstice . He is a genuinely nice guy and a hardcore health and fitness enthusiast . When he was 18 , he made homemade masturbation videos under the name `` Kirk Steele '' . For the majority of the series , he was oblivious to Abbi 's desire to be a trainer and badgered her to clean things around the gym . Abbi and Trey began dating in Season 3 , although Abbi attempted to keep it a secret out of embarrassment and left him humiliated when he heard her describe him to Ilana as a `` joke '' and a `` guilty pleasure .
