Variety 's Justin Chang called the film an `` exercise in sensory overkill '' and said that Bay took on `` the weighty moral conundrums of human cloning , resolving them in a storm of bullets , car chases and more explosions than you can shake a syringe at . '' He noted McGregor and Buscemi as highlights of the film , along with Nigel Phelps ' production design . However , he felt the story lacked in surprises and blamed `` attention - deficit editing by Paul Rubell and Christian Wagner '' for action sequences that he thought lacked tension and were `` joltingly repetitive '' .
