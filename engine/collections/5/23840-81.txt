The number of graduates coming out of technical colleges increased to over 7 lakh in 2011 from 5.5 lakh in FY 2010 . However , according to one study , 75 % of technical graduates and more than 85 % of general graduates lack the skills needed in India 's most demanding and high - growth global industries such as Information Technology . These high - tech global information technologies companies directly or indirectly employ about 23 lakh people , less than 1 % of India 's labour pool . India offers one of the largest pool of technically skilled graduates in the world . Given the sheer numbers of students seeking education in engineering , science and mathematics , India faces daunting challenges in scaling up capacity while maintaining quality .
