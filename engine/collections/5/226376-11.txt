Nessus is known for his role in the story of the Tunic of Nessus . After carrying Deianeira , the wife of Heracles , across the river , he attempted to force himself upon her . Heracles saw this from across the river and shot a Hydra - poisoned arrow into Nessus 's breast . As he lay dying , as a final act of malice , Nessus told Deianeira that his blood would ensure that Heracles would be true to her forever , knowing the blood to be infected with the hydra 's poison .
