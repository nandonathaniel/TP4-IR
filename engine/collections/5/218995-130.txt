Automakers have said that small , fuel - efficient vehicles cost the auto industry billions of dollars . They cost almost as much to design and market but can not be sold for as much as larger vehicles such as SUVs , because consumers expect small cars to be inexpensive . In 1999 , USA Today reported small cars tend to depreciate faster than larger cars , so they are worth less in value to the consumer over time . However , 2007 Edmunds depreciation data show that some small cars , primarily premium models , are among the best in holding their value .
