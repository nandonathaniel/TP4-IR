Synthesis of RNA is usually catalyzed by an enzyme -- RNA polymerase -- using DNA as a template , a process known as transcription . Initiation of transcription begins with the binding of the enzyme to a promoter sequence in the DNA ( usually found `` upstream '' of a gene ) . The DNA double helix is unwound by the helicase activity of the enzyme . The enzyme then progresses along the template strand in the 3 ' to 5 ' direction , synthesizing a complementary RNA molecule with elongation occurring in the 5 ' to 3 ' direction . The DNA sequence also dictates where termination of RNA synthesis will occur .
