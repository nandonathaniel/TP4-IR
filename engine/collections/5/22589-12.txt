The hoplite army consisted of heavily armoured infantrymen . Their armour , also called panoply , was made of full bronze , weighing nearly 32 kilograms ( 70 lb ) . The average farmer - peasant hoplite typically wore no armour , carrying only a shield , a spear , and perhaps a helmet plus a secondary weapon. The linothorax was the most popular type armour worn by the hoplites , since it was cost - effective and provided decent protection . The richer upper - class hoplites typically had a bronze cuirass of either the bell or muscled variety , a bronze helmet with cheekplates , as well as greaves and other armour . The design of the helmets used varied through time . The Corinthian helmet was at first standardized and was a very successful design . Later variants included the Chalcidian helmet , a lightened version of the Corinthian helmet , and the very simple Pilos helmet worn by the later hoplites . Often the helmet was decorated with one , sometimes more horsehair crests , and / or bronze animal horns and ears . Helmets were often painted as well . The Thracian helmet had a large visor to further increase protection . In later periods , linen breastplates called linothorax were used , as they were tougher and cheaper to make . The linen was 0.5 - centimetre ( 0.20 in ) thick .
