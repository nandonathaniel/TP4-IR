The Belcher family runs a hamburger restaurant . Bob is the restaurant 's owner and husband to the fun - loving and happy - go - lucky Linda . Their three children are Tina , the oldest , Gene , the only boy , and Louise , the youngest . All three kids help out around the restaurant to some extent . Louise is somewhat of a precocious menace and an instigator of many of the debacles that face the Belcher family . Tina is awkward , but full of heart , and muddles her way through her pubescent experiences , such as leg waxing and strong fixations on neighborhood boys . Gene is the more light hearted goofball type and aspires to be a great musician . His musical numbers are often featured throughout the show , though Linda is very musical herself . One of her songs from Episode 5 Season 3 , `` An Indecent Thanksgiving Proposal , '' gained so much popularity that it was covered by the band The National . Of all the musical numbers throughout the first three seasons however , the show 's writers dub `` Electric Love '' as the best musical number so far . This song is written by Gene and featured in the episode `` Topsy '' from season 3 .
