These efficiencies are for the light - emitting diode only , held at low temperature in a lab . Since LEDs installed in real fixtures operate at higher temperature and with driver losses , real - world efficiencies are much lower . United States Department of Energy ( DOE ) testing of commercial LED lamps designed to replace incandescent lamps or CFLs showed that average efficacy was still about 46 lm / W in 2009 ( tested performance ranged from 17 lm / W to 79 lm / W ) .
