Classical Cepheids ( also known as Population I Cepheids , type I Cepheids , or Delta Cepheid variables ) undergo pulsations with very regular periods on the order of days to months . Classical Cepheids are Population I variable stars which are 4 -- 20 times more massive than the Sun , and up to 100,000 times more luminous . These Cepheids are yellow bright giants and supergiants of spectral class F6 -- K2 and their radii change by ( ~ 25 % for the longer - period I Carinae ) millions of kilometers during a pulsation cycle .
