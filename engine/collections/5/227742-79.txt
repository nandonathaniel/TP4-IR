The matrix is inserted into the bottom of a device called a hand mould . The mould is clamped shut and molten type metal alloy consisting mostly of lead and tin , with a small amount of antimony for hardening , is poured into a cavity from the top . Antimony has the rare property of expanding as it cools , giving the casting sharp edges . When the type metal has sufficiently cooled , the mould is unlocked and a rectangular block approximately 4 centimeters long , called a sort , is extracted . Excess casting on the end of the sort , called the tang , is later removed to make the sort the precise height required for printing , known as `` type height '' .
