This first organization proved largely ineffectual but does seem to have provided the inspiration for the first effective Alliance group , which was established on April 15 , 1880 , by newspaper editor Milton George in Chicago . George 's paper , Western Rural , gave the new organization public exposure and inspired the establishment of chartered local organizations , beginning in Filley , Nebraska and soon spreading throughout the American Midwest . Dues were not collected in the earliest phase of Northern Alliance 's existence , with editor George financing the group 's launch -- a fact which spurred growth . Within a month more than 200 locals had been chartered , with claims made that 1,000 local groups had been established by the end of the organization 's first year .
