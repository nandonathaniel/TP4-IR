Disposal : processes to dispose of waste be it landfilling , incineration , pyrolysis , gasification and other finalist solutions . Landfill is restricted in some EU - countries through Landfill Directives and there is a debate about Incineration For example , original plastic which contains a lot of energy is just recovered in energy instead of being recycled . According to the Waste Framework Directive , the European Waste Hierarchy is legally binding except in cases that may require specific waste streams to depart from the hierarchy . This should be justified on the basis of life - cycle thinking .
