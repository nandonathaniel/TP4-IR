The flag is flown at half - mast in New Zealand -- always at the discretion of the Minister for Arts , Culture and Heritage -- to indicate a period of mourning . Notable occasions on which the flag was half - masted include : the death of former prime minister David Lange , and the death and state funeral of mountaineer Sir Edmund Hillary . When the flag is flown at half - mast , it should be lowered to a position recognisably at half - mast to avoid the appearance of a flag which has accidentally fallen away from the top of the flagpole . The flag should be at least its own height from the top of the flagpole .
