Charlie Bucket is a title character and the protagonist of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory , its sequel Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator , and the film adaptations of these books . He is depicted as a kind - hearted , nice , selfless , sweet , brave , but poor boy that lives with his mother , father and four bedridden grandparents . Charlie was to have been a little black boy at the outset , but the detail was changed at the insistence of Dahl 's literary agent to better appeal to audiences . In 1971 , he has a newspaper route after school . He and his family follow the progress of the hunt for the Golden Tickets in newspapers , in films , and on television . Unlike the first four finalists , Charlie is honest and generous . In the 1971 film , Charlie was portrayed by Peter Ostrum , in his only film appearance . His nationality is never explicitly stated , but in the 1971 film , he speaks with an American accent , and in the 2005 film , he speaks with an English accent . The filmmakers have stated that it was their intention that Charlie 's hometown be kept ambiguous .
