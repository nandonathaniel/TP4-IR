Developed in the 1880s , the ukulele is based on several small guitar - like instruments of Portuguese origin , the machete , the cavaquinho , the timple and the rajão , introduced to the Hawaiian Islands by Portuguese immigrants from Madeira and Cape Verde . Three immigrants in particular , Madeiran cabinet makers Manuel Nunes , José do Espírito Santo , and Augusto Dias , are generally credited as the first ukulele makers . Two weeks after they disembarked from the SS Ravenscrag in late August 1879 , the Hawaiian Gazette reported that `` Madeira Islanders recently arrived here , have been delighting the people with nightly street concerts .
