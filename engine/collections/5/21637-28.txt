As they arrive at Rickover 's house with uniformed officers and the antidote , the group witness Monk forcing Rickover at gunpoint to dig at a spot before his front yard 's sundial , stating to the group that the remains of the missing midwife are there . As Disher continues digging , Monk reveals to the group that Rickover committed the murders , in order to ensure that nothing stopped him from securing the position of appellate judge that he had worked hard for . Twelve years ago , Wendy Stroud had found religion and told Rickover she intended to tell the press about his affair with Trudy and the child it caused , that she had helped to deliver , forcing him to kill her and bury her in his front yard ; his reason for not wanting to leave his home , even if it meant commuting to Sacramento , was because he did n't want to risk anyone digging up the remains . After killing the midwife , Rickover was forced to kill Trudy , as she was the only person who would be able to connect Stroud 's disappearance to him . Twelve years later , Dr. Nash came across references to the child when digitizing the birthing clinic 's patient records , and thus suspected what had happened to Stroud . Becoming greedy , he attempted to blackmail him , causing Rickover to panic and hire Kazarinski to kill him , before later having him poison Monk upon the detective becoming a serious issue ; he knew the handwipes had been poisoned , as when Monk dropped one when confronting him , Rickover had picked it up with his pen . Upon Disher finding the remains , Rickover steals Monk 's gun as he suffers a coughing fit , shouts `` You take care of her '' , and then commits suicide in order to avoid going to jail .
