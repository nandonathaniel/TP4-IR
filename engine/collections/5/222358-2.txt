Jet engines , particularly turbojets , are a type of gas turbine configured such that most of the work available results from the thrust of the hot exhaust gases . High bypass turbofans that are used in all modern commercial jetliners , and most modern military aircraft , get most of their thrust from the internal fan , which is powered by a gas turbine ; turboprop engines are similar , but use an external propeller rather than an internal fan . The hot exhaust gas from a turboprop engine can give a small amount of thrust , but the propeller is the main source of thrust .
