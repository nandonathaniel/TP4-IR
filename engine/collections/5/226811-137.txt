In July 1846 , three commissioners , R.R.W. Lingen , Jellynger C. Symons and H.R. Vaughan Johnson , were appointed to inquire into the state of education in Wales ; the Commissioners were all Anglicans and thus presumed unsympathetic to the nonconformist majority in Wales . The Commissioners presented their report to the Government on 1 July 1847 in three large blue - bound volumes . This report quickly became known as the Treachery of the Blue Books ( Brad y Llyfrau Gleision ) since , apart from documenting the state of education in Wales , the Commissioners were also free with their comments disparaging the language , nonconformity , and the morals of the Welsh people in general . An immediate effect of the report was that ordinary Welsh people began to believe that the only way to get on in the world was through the medium of English , and an inferiority complex developed about the Welsh language whose effects have not yet been completely eradicated . The historian Professor Kenneth O. Morgan referred to the significance of the report and its consequences as `` the Glencoe and the Amritsar of Welsh history '' .
