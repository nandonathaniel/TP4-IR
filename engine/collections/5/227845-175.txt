/ s / and / z / are normally lamino - alveolar , as in English . However , a number of dialects in northern Portugal pronounce / s / and / z / as apico - alveolar sibilants ( sounding somewhat like a soft ( ʃ ) or ( ʒ ) ) , as in the Romance languages of northern Iberia . A very few northeastern Portugal dialects still maintain the medieval distinction between apical and laminal sibilants ( written s / ss and c / ç / z , respectively ) .
