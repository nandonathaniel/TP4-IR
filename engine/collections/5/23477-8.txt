The design complexity of CPUs increased as various technologies facilitated building smaller and more reliable electronic devices . The first such improvement came with the advent of the transistor . Transistorized CPUs during the 1950s and 1960s no longer had to be built out of bulky , unreliable , and fragile switching elements like vacuum tubes and relays . With this improvement more complex and reliable CPUs were built onto one or several printed circuit boards containing discrete ( individual ) components .
