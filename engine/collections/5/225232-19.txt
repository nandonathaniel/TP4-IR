Archaeological terminology for this region has changed repeatedly . Before the 1970s , the single Pleistocene landmass was called Australasia , derived from the Latin australis , meaning `` southern '' , although this word is most often used for a wider region that includes lands like New Zealand that are not on the same continental shelf . In the early 1970s , the term Greater Australia was introduced for the Pleistocene continent . Then at a 1975 conference and consequent publication , the name Sahul was extended from its previous use for just the Sahul Shelf to cover the continent .
