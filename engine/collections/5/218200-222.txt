Level 4 ( process ) : when this innovation is inclusive , it has the case of excluded group that is involved in the innovation development . It is almost rare for the whole group to be involved , somehow the effect of this could immediately diminish into `` members of the excluded group '' . This level must be de-synthesized as stated by the sub-processes of innovation : invention , design , development , production , and distribution . These could construct a set of sub-steps within , e.g. , the speculation of lower value of inclusion downstream elements than the upstream elements . Furthermore , the scope of participation is being identified with the different levels of inclusion . Repeatedly , there could be sub-steps similar to those which are viewed when analysing involvement in the development , with greater sub-steps depicting extensive involvement . Borrowing additional ideas from Arnstein 's in his ladder of participation , the sub-steps can be included as follows : being informed , being consulted , collaborating , being empowered , and controlling .
