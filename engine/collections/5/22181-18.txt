Ice ages can be further divided by location and time ; for example , the names Riss ( 180,000 -- 130,000 years bp ) and WÃ¼rm ( 70,000 -- 10,000 years bp ) refer specifically to glaciation in the Alpine region . The maximum extent of the ice is not maintained for the full interval . The scouring action of each glaciation tends to remove most of the evidence of prior ice sheets almost completely , except in regions where the later sheet does not achieve full coverage .
