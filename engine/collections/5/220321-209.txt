The festival of Deepavali has begun to find acceptance in the broader British national consciousness as more non-Hindus appreciate and celebrate Hinduism on this occasion . Hindus celebrate all over the UK which also brings an understanding to different cultures for the rest of the community . Over the past decade national and civic leaders such as Prince Charles have attended Diwali celebrations at some of the UK 's prominent Hindu temples , such as the Swaminarayan Temple in Neasden , using the occasion to commend the Hindu community 's contributions to British life . In 2013 , Prime Minister David Cameron and his wife joined thousands of worshipers at the BAPS Swaminarayan Mandir in Neasden to celebrate Diwali and the Annakut festival marking the Hindu New Year . Since 2009 , Diwali has been celebrated every year at 10 Downing Street , the residence of the British Prime Minister . The yearly celebration , begun by Gordon Brown and continued by David Cameron , is one of the most anticipated events hosted by the British Prime Minister .
