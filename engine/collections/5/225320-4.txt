Finalizers are generally used to perform some form of cleanup , similar to destructors , but differ in that destructors are executed deterministically , while finalizers are executed at the discretion of the garbage collector , which is usually not deterministic . However , a finalizer can include arbitrary code ; a particularly complex use is to automatically return the object to an object pool .
