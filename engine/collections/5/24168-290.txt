Meanwhile , as the 1950s drew to a close the events in Hungary produced fractures within the Communist political parties of Western European countries . The Italian Communist Party ( PCI ) suffered a split . According to the official newspaper of the PCI , l'Unit√† , most ordinary members and the Party leadership , including Palmiro Togliatti and Giorgio Napolitano , supported the actions of the Soviet Union in suppressing the uprising . However Giuseppe Di Vittorio , chief of the Communist trade union CGIL , spoke out against the leadership 's position , as did prominent party members Antonio Giolitti , Loris Fortuna , and many others influential in the Communist party . Pietro Nenni of the Italian Socialist Party , a close ally of the PCI , opposed the Soviet intervention as well . Napolitano , elected in 2006 as President of the Italian Republic , wrote in his 2005 political autobiography that he regretted his justification of Soviet action in Hungary , stating at the time he believed Party unity and the leadership of Soviet communism was more important .
