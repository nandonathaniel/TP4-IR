Smith 's earliest TV roles were as a non-speaking extra in various ITV programmes . He had his first speaking role in the BBC 's Doctor Who serial The Dalek Invasion of Earth ( 1964 ) . Smith persuaded the serial 's director , Richard Martin , to expand the role so that his character , Wells , appeared in three of the serial 's six episodes instead of only one or two as originally scripted . This was followed by small roles in many other adventure series , such as The Saint , The Avengers , The Champions and Ace of Wands . In 1969 he made the cast list of one of televisions great period dramas , ' The First Churchills ' in which he played the historical figure of Titus Oates .
