Malia 's new enemy is Soraya Laurent , leader of the black werewolves , another breed of the werewolves species who rebelled against the Waya Council decades ago under Lyka Ortega 's guardianship in the Lobo series , a generation before Lia and Mateo 's LLU peace agreement was enforced . Certain that Jacintha defeated the cursed ink , the black werewolves plan to take over the predatory might to feed on humans , violating their decades - long vow to protect them . Soraya plots to kill Malia who would never allow this to happen .
