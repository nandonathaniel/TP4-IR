In Mesoamerica , wild teosinte was transformed through human selection into the ancestor of modern maize , more than 6,000 years ago . It gradually spread across North America and was the major crop of Native Americans at the time of European exploration . Other Mesoamerican crops include hundreds of varieties of locally domesticated squash and beans , while cocoa , also domesticated in the region , was a major crop . The turkey , one of the most important meat birds , was probably domesticated in Mexico or the U.S. Southwest .
