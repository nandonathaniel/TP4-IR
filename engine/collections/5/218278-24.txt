The Battle of Hastings was fought on 14 October 1066 less than three weeks after the Battle of Stamford Bridge but the tapestry does not provide this context . The English fight on foot behind a shield wall , whilst the Normans are on horses . Two fallen knights are named as Leofwine and Gyrth , Harold 's brothers , but both armies are shown fighting bravely . Bishop Odo brandishes his baton or mace and rallies the Norman troops in battle . To reassure his knights that he is still alive and well , William raises his helmet to show his face . The battle becomes very bloody with troops being slaughtered and dismembered corpses littering the ground . King Harold is killed . This scene can be interpreted in different ways , as the name `` Harold '' appears above a number of knights , making it difficult to identify which character is Harold . The final remaining scene shows unarmoured English troops fleeing the battlefield . The last part of the tapestry is missing but it is thought that story contained only one additional scene .
