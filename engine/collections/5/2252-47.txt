The House of Lords scrutinises bills that have been approved by the House of Commons . It regularly reviews and amends Bills from the Commons . While it is unable to prevent Bills passing into law , except in certain limited circumstances , it can delay Bills and force the Commons to reconsider their decisions . In this capacity , the House of Lords acts as a check on the House of Commons that is independent from the electoral process . Bills can be introduced into either the House of Lords or the House of Commons . While members of the Lords may also take on roles as government ministers , high - ranking officials such as cabinet ministers are usually drawn from the Commons . The House of Lords has its own support services , separate from the Commons , including the House of Lords Library .
