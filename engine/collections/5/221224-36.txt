The ancient Mesopotamians believed that a lunar eclipse was when the moon was being attacked by seven demons . This attack was more than just one on the moon , however , for the Mesopotamians linked what happened in the sky with what happened on the land , and because the king of Mesopotamia represented the land , the seven demons were thought to be also attacking the king . In order to prevent this attack on the king , the Mesopotamians made someone pretend to be the king so they would be attacked instead of the true king . After the lunar eclipse was over , the substitute king was made to disappear ( possibly by poisoning ) .
