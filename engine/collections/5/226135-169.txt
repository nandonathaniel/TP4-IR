1993 : Paul Tracy won his first career Indy car race , battling Nigel Mansell most of the afternoon . Tracy led 81 of the 105 laps , but his day was not without incident . While leading the race on lap 25 , he clipped wheels with Danny Sullivan , and was forced to pit with a flat tire . Later on lap 61 , he had to make an unscheduled pit stop for a blistered tire . Tracy re-assumed the lead on lap 74 after Mansell made his final pit stop , and when Mansell later lost second gear , Tracy cruised to the finish . Bobby Rahal , running 11th at the halfway point , finished 2nd in the RH chassis , owing much to the fact that Mansell , Scott Goodyear , Mario Andretti , Raul Boesel all suffered contact or mechanical problems late in the race .
