In 1999 , Who Moved My Cheese Inc was founded to handle the Who Moved My Cheese ? book order demands from businesses . For several years , the company worked 24 / 7 just to keep up with the demand for the book . In 2005 , the company was reorganized as Spencer Johnson Partners with the idea of bringing in partners and additional content from Dr. Spencer Johnson , the author . Spencer Johnson Partners focused on creating additional programs and services that would continue to help clients navigate change , including Gaining Change Skills . Then , in 2009 , the company was purchased and renamed Red Tree Leadership .
