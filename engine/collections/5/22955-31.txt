In the 10th century , Mataram , challenged the supremacy of Srivijaya , resulting in the destruction of the Mataram capital by Srivijaya early in the 11th century . Restored by King Airlangga ( c. 1020 -- 1050 ) , the kingdom split on his death ; and the new state of Kediri , in eastern Java , became the centre of Javanese culture for the next two centuries , spreading its influence to the eastern part of island South East Asia . The spice trade was now becoming of increasing importance , as the demand by European countries for spices grew . Before they learned to keep sheep and cattle alive in the winter , they had to eat salted meat , made palatable by the addition of spices . One of the main sources was the Maluku Islands ( or `` Spice Islands '' ) in Indonesia , and Kediri became a strong trading nation . In the 13th century , however , the Kediri dynasty was overthrown by a revolution , and Singhasari arose in east Java . The domains of this new state expanded under the rule of its warrior - king Kertanegara . He was killed by a prince of the previous Kediri dynasty , who then established the last great Hindu - Javanese kingdom , Majapahit . By the middle of the 14th century Majapahit controlled most of Java , Sumatra and the Malay peninsula , part of Borneo , the southern Celebes and the Moluccas . It also exerted considerable influence on the mainland .
