Rabbi Aron Mendes Chumaceiro has said that nearly all the elements of the prayer have counterparts in the Jewish Bible and Deuterocanonical books : the first part in Isaiah 63 : 15 -- 16 ( `` Look down from heaven and see , from your holy and beautiful habitation ... For you are our Father ... '' ) and Ezekiel 36 : 23 ( `` I will vindicate the holiness of my great name ... '' ) and Ezekiel 38 : 23 ( `` I will show my greatness and my holiness and make myself known in the eyes of many nations ... '' ) , the second part in Obadiah 1 : 21 ( `` Saviours shall go up to Mount Zion to rule Mount Esau , and the kingdom shall be the LORD 's '' ) and 1 Samuel 3 : 18 ( `` ... It is the LORD . Let him do what seems good to him '' ) , the third part in Proverbs 30 : 8 ( `` ... feed me with my apportioned bread '' ) , the fourth part in Sirach 28 : 2 ( `` Forgive your neighbour the wrong he has done , and then your sins will be pardoned when you pray '' ) . `` Deliver us from evil '' can be compared with Psalm 119 : 133 ( `` ... let no iniquity get dominion over me . '' ) . Chumaceiro says that , because the idea of God leading a human into temptation contradicts the righteousness and love of God , `` Lead us not into temptation '' has no counterpart in the Jewish Bible / Christian Old Testament .
