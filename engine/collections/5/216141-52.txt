According to reviewer Jim Esch , the opener `` Would n't It Be Nice '' inaugurates and suggests the album 's pervasive theme : `` fragile lovers buckling under the pressure of external forces they ca n't control , self - imposed romantic expectations and personal limitations , while simultaneously trying to maintain faith in one other . It is a theme that keeps reverberating sweetly , and hauntingly , throughout Pet Sounds . '' Carl said : `` The disappointment and the loss of innocence that everyone had to go through when they grow up and find everything 's not Hollywood are the recurrent themes on that album . '' Critics Richard Goldstein and Nik Cohn noted incongruity between the album 's music and lyrics , where the latter suggested the work to be `` sad songs about happiness '' while also celebrating loneliness and heartache . In the opinion of Perone , it is the next track , `` You Still Believe in Me '' , which features the first expression of introspective themes that pervade the rest of the album .
