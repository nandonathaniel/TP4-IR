Since the early 1990s , the Britannica has faced new challenges from digital information sources . The Internet , facilitated by the development of search engines , has grown into a common source of information for many people , and provides easy access to reliable original sources and expert opinions , thanks in part to initiatives such as Google Books , MIT 's release of its educational materials and the open PubMed Central library of the National Library of Medicine . In general , the Internet tends to provide more current coverage than print media , due to the ease with which material on the Internet can be updated . In rapidly changing fields such as science , technology , politics , culture and modern history , the Britannica has struggled to stay up - to - date , a problem first analysed systematically by its former editor Walter Yust . Eventually , the Britannica turned to focus more on its online edition .
