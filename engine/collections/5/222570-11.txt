Solid state detectors use semiconductors to detect x-rays . Direct digital detectors are so - called because they directly convert x-ray photons to electrical charge and thus a digital image . Indirect systems may have intervening steps for example first converting x-ray photons to visible light , and then an electronic signal . Both systems typically use thin film transistors to read out and convert the electronic signal to a digital image . Unlike film or CR no manual scanning or development step is required to obtain a digital image , and so in this sense both systems are `` direct '' . Both types of system have considerably higher quantum efficiency than CR .
