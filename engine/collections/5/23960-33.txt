As comedians , it would n't be a good thing if we went to pursue a hit in the States because they could potentially make something that became big , so we thought it would be more fun from a comedian perspective to come home to the talk show and say , ' Listen we had the chance , we could 've made it big , but the only idea we got for the song was this old idea about what the fox says so we 're sorry . We screwed up . ' That was the plan ... That would 've been funny to say on the talk show .
