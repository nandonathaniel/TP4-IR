The U.S. Congress laid the groundwork for the establishment of Texas A&M in 1862 with the adoption of the Morrill Act . The act auctioned land grants of public lands to establish endowments for colleges where the `` leading object shall be , without excluding other scientific and classical studies and including military tactics , to teach such branches of learning as are related to agriculture and mechanical arts ... to promote the liberal and practical education of the industrial classes in the several pursuits and professions in life '' . In 1871 , the Texas Legislature used these funds to establish the state 's first public institution of higher education , the Agricultural and Mechanical College of Texas , then known as Texas A.M.C. Brazos County donated 2,416 acres ( 10 km ) near Bryan , Texas , for the school 's campus .
