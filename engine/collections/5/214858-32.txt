After reaching a new distribution deal with Def Jam in 1997 , Jay - Z released his follow - up In My Lifetime , Vol. 1 . Produced by Sean `` Puff Daddy '' Combs , it sold better than his previous effort . Jay - Z later explained that the album was made during one of the worst periods of his life when he was reeling from the death of his close friend , The Notorious B.I.G. The album was a personal revelation for Jay - Z as he told the stories of his difficult upbringing . The album 's glossy production stood as a contrast to his first release , and some dedicated fans felt he had `` sold out . '' However , the album did feature some beats from producers who had worked with him on Reasonable Doubt , namely DJ Premier and Ski . Like its predecessor , In My Lifetime , Vol. 1 earned platinum status in the United States .
