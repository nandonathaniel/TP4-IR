During the union of Denmark - Norway from 1380 until 1814 , the Danish royal court in Copenhagen was counted as the Norwegian royal court , and thus there was not royal court present in Norway during this period . During the union between Norway and Sweden from 1814 to 1905 , there were Norwegian courtiers appointed who served during the Swedish royal family 's visits to Norway . The female courtiers were appointed according to the Swedish court model , that is to say the class of hovfröken ( Maid of honor ) ; kammarfröken ( Chief Maid of Honor ) and statsfru ( Lady of the Bedchamber ) , all supervised by the overhoffmesterinne ( Mistress of the Robes ) : these posts were first appointed in 1817 . When the union between Sweden and Norway was dissolved in 1905 , a permanent Norwegian royal court was established .
