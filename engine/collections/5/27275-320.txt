On 12 February 2013 , a 600 m ( 6,500 sq ft ) section of the roof of the turbine - building , adjacent to the sarcophagus , collapsed . At first it was assumed that the roof collapsed because of the weight of snow on it . However the amount of snow was not exceptional , and the report of a Ukrainian fact - finding panel concluded that the part collapse of the turbine - building was the result of sloppy repair work and aging of the structure . The report mentioned the possibility that the repaired part of the turbine - building added a larger strain on the total structure than expected , and the braces in the roof were damaged by corrosion and sloppy welding . Experts such as Valentin Kupny , former deputy director of the nuclear plant , did warn that the complex was on the verge of a collapse , leaving the building in an extremely dangerous condition . A proposed reinforcement in 2005 was cancelled by a superior official . After the 12 February incident , radioactivity levels were up to 19 becquerels per cubic meter of air : 12 times normal . The report assumed radioactive materials from inside the structure spread to the surroundings after the roof collapsed . All 225 workers employed by the Chernobyl complex and the French company that is building the new shelter were evacuated shortly after the collapse . According to the managers of the complex , radiation levels around the plant were at normal levels ( between 5 and 6 Î¼Sv / h ) and should not affect workers ' health . According to Kupny the situation was underestimated by the Chernobyl nuclear complex managers , and information was kept secret .
