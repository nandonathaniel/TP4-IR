Power came instead to his former finance and defence minister , VP Singh of Janata Dal . Singh had been moved from the Finance ministry to the Defence ministry after he unearthed some scandals which made the Congress leadership uncomfortable . Singh then unearthed the Bofors scandal , and was sacked from the party and office . Becoming a popular crusader for reform and clean government , Singh led the Janata Dal coalition to a majority . He was supported by BJP and the leftist parties from outside . Becoming Prime Minister , Singh made an important visit to the Golden Temple shrine , to heal the wounds of the past . He started to implement the controversial Mandal Commission report , to increase the quota in reservation for low - caste Hindus . The BJP protested these implementations and took its support back , following which he resigned . Chandra Shekhar split to form the Janata Dal ( Socialist ) , supported by Rajiv 's Congress . This new government also collapsed in a matter of months , when Congress withdrew its support .
