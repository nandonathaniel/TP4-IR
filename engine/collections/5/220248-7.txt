In the general public , there was little if any support for entering the war on the side of Germany . The great majority of German Americans , as well as Scandinavian Americans , wanted the United States to remain neutral ; however , at the outbreak of war , thousands of US citizens had tried to enlist in the German army . The Irish Catholic community , based in the large cities and often in control of the Democratic Party apparatus , was strongly hostile to helping Britain in any way , especially after the Easter uprising of 1916 in Ireland . Most of the Protestant church leaders in the United States , regardless of their theology , favoured pacifistic solutions whereby the United States would broker a peace . Most of the leaders of the women 's movement , typified by Jane Addams , likewise sought pacifistic solutions . The most prominent opponent of war was industrialist Henry Ford , who personally financed and led a peace ship to Europe to try to negotiate among the belligerents ; no negotiations resulted .
