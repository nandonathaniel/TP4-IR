Columbus named the island San Juan Bautista , in honor of Saint John the Baptist , while the capital city was named Ciudad de Puerto Rico ( `` Rich Port City '' ) . Eventually traders and other maritime visitors came to refer to the entire island as Puerto Rico , while San Juan became the name used for the main trading / shipping port and the capital city .
