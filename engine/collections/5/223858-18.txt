The narrative of the film is presented as evidence given at a hearing following Vlad 's alignment with the Roman Catholic King of Hungary . At the end of the film , Vlad is excommunicated by the Orthodox Church shortly before being assassinated by Radu and having a vision of Lidia calling his name . As a result of his condemnation by the priests , Vlad is found to have risen from the grave and gained eternal life , free to roam the earth ( as he has been denied entrance to both Heaven and Hell ) implying that he has now become the very vampire for which his name is famous .
