On 12 September , Hitler made a speech at a Nazi Party rally in Nuremberg on the Sudeten crisis in which he condemned the actions of the government of Czechoslovakia . Hitler denounced Czechoslovakia as being a fraudulent state that was in violation of international law 's emphasis of national self - determination , claiming it was a Czech hegemony where neither the Germans , the Slovaks , the Hungarians , the Ukrainians , nor the Poles of the country actually wanted to be in a union with the Czechs . Hitler accused Czechoslovakia 's President Edvard Beneš of seeking to gradually exterminate the Sudeten Germans , claiming that since Czechoslovakia 's creation over 600,000 Germans were intentionally forced out of their homes under the threat of starvation if they did not leave . He claimed that Beneš ' government was persecuting Germans along with Hungarians , Poles , and Slovaks , and accused Beneš of threatening these nationalities with being branded traitors if they were not loyal to the country . He claimed that he , as the head of state of Germany , would support the right of the self - determination of fellow Germans in the Sudetenland . He condemned Beneš for his government 's recent execution of several German protesters . He accused Beneš of being belligerent and threatening behaviour towards Germany which , if war broke out , would result in Beneš forcing Sudeten Germans to fight against their will against Germans from Germany . Hitler accused the government of Czechoslovakia of being a client regime of France , claiming that the French Minister of Aviation Pierre Cot had said `` We need this state as a base from which to drop bombs with greater ease to destroy Germany 's economy and its industry '' .
