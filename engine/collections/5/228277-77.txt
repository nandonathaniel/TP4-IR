The West , less urbanized with a spread - out populace , may have experienced an economic decline throughout the Late Empire in some provinces . Southern Italy , northern Gaul ( except for large towns and cities ) to some extent Spain and the Danubian areas may have suffered . The East was not so destitute , especially as Emperors like Constantine the Great and Constantius II had invested heavily in the eastern economy . As a result , the Eastern Empire could afford large numbers of professional soldiers and augment them with mercenaries , while the Western Roman Empire could not afford this to the same extent . Even in major defeats , the East could , certainly not without difficulties , buy off its enemies with a ransom .
