Comprehensively wrecked , the singer ( Morrison ) wound up lying on the floor mumbling the words to his Oedipal nightmare , ' Fuck the mother , kill the father . ' Then , suddenly animated , he rose and threw a TV at the control room window . Sent home by ( producer Paul A . ) Rothchild like a naughty schoolkid , he returned in the middle of the night , broke in , peeled off his clothes , yanked a fire extinguisher from the wall and drenched the studio . Alerted , Rothchild came back and persuaded the naked , foam - flecked Morrison to leave once more , advising the studio owner to charge the damage to Elektra .
