Private property existed in the form of royal estates , especially in the Sacred Valley near the Inca capital of Cuzco . Emperors customarily confiscated large quantities of land for their own use and exploitation and the estate was inherited by descendants after the emperor 's death . The famous archaeological site of Machu Picchu was a royal estate . The royal estates made use of local labor , but also were staffed by a servant class called yanakunas who were ruled directly by Inca nobles and were outside the ayllu kinship system . In some areas , such as the valley of Cochabamba in Bolivia , state farms were dedicated to the production of maize , the prestige crop of the Incas but one which could not be grown at the higher elevations of the Andes .
