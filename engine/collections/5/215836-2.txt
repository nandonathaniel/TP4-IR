In the New Testament , `` Son of God '' is applied to Jesus on many occasions . Jesus is declared to be the Son of God on two separate occasions by a voice speaking from Heaven . Jesus is also explicitly and implicitly described as the Son of God by himself and by various individuals who appear in the New Testament . As applied to Jesus , the term is a reference to his role as the Messiah , the King chosen by God . The contexts and ways in which Jesus ' title , Son of God , means something more than or other than Messiah remain the subject of ongoing scholarly study and discussion .
