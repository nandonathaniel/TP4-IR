The name `` Altima '' was originally applied to a top trim line of the Nissan Leopard for the Japanese market in 1986 , and then to the Nissan Laurel mid-size car sold in Central America and the Caribbean before 1992 . In 1992 , Nissan discontinued the Stanza which was a Nissan Bluebird clone , replacing it with the US - built Altima , while remaining a compact car . The first Altima was produced in June 1992 , as a 1993 model . All Altimas were built in Smyrna , Tennessee , until June 2004 , when Nissan 's Canton , Mississippi plant also began producing the model to meet high demand .
