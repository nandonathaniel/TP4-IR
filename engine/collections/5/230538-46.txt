`` The Spoils of War '' was directed by Matt Shakman . This was Shakman 's first episode of Game of Thrones , but he had previously served as a director for several other television series , including Fargo , The Good Wife , Mad Men and It 's Always Sunny in Philadelphia , among others . The battle sequence at the conclusion of the episode , which was nicknamed `` The Loot Train Attack '' by HBO , set an industry record for the most stuntmen set on fire , with real fire being used , rather than special effects , to simulate the dragon fire being emitted by Drogon . There were 73 `` fire burns , '' in addition to 20 people being set on fire for a single shot . Filming of the attack sequence took approximately 18 main - unit days , five second - unit days , and several weeks for the effects - unit . In an interview with The Hollywood Reporter , Shakman spoke about the first time he read the script of the battle , saying `` I was reading the script and this battle began and I kept turning pages and the battle kept going on page after page after page ! The excitement , the stress and the fear all built at the same time , mirroring probably what was happening on screen . It was a huge opportunity and a challenge . I spent the better part of six months working on that one sequence . '' The `` Loot Train Attack '' was filmed in CÃ¡ceres , Spain , and Emilia Clarke , who portrays Daenerys Targaryen , was filmed riding a motion base on a stage in Belfast in front of several green screens .
