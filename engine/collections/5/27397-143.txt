Today North Carolina calls itself home to 16 regional councils of government . Regional councils in North Carolina are committed to working together . In 2010 the seventeen regional councils existing at that time signed an inter-regional cooperative agreement that established a policy to enhance their value by sharing member resources and capacity to deliver services to the state of North Carolina . This agreement also endorses regional councils , to carry out activities in regions outside their boundaries with consent when those services are to benefit the region and the state . Regional boundaries correspond to county borders , with each council being made up of both county and municipal governments . Although the number of regional councils in North Carolina has decreased over the years , the number of citizens served by the councils continues to rise . As of 2007 , it is reported that the number of local governments served by regional councils in North Carolina has increased by 16 % since 1994 . Throughout this same time period the number of citizens served by regional councils has increased by 35 % or approximately 2.3 million . This equates to 92 % of local governments and 97 % of all North Carolina citizens being represented by regional councils as of July 1 , 2007 .
