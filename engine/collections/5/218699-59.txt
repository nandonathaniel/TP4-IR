Excluding gatherings solely for diplomats and academics , there are a few organizations which regularly hold events at the UN . The United Nations Association of the United States of America ( UNA - USA ) , a non-governmental organization , holds an annual `` member 's day '' event in one of the conference rooms . Model United Nations conferences sponsored by UNA - USA , the National Collegiate Conference Association ( NCCA / NMUN ) , and the International Model UN Association ( IMUNA / NHSMUN ) hold part of their sessions in the General Assembly chamber . Seton Hall University 's Whitehead School of Diplomacy hosts its UN summer study program at the headquarters as well .
