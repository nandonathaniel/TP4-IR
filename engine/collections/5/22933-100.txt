In preparation for dropping an atomic bomb on Hiroshima , the Oppenheimer - led Scientific Panel of the Interim Committee decided against a demonstration bomb , and against a special leaflet warning , in both cases because of the uncertainty of a successful detonation , and the wish to maximize shock in the leadership . No warning was given to Hiroshima that a new and much more destructive bomb was going to be dropped . Various sources give conflicting information about when the last leaflets were dropped on Hiroshima prior to the atomic bomb . Robert Jay Lifton writes that it was July 27 , and Theodore H. McNelly that it was July 3 . The USAAF history notes eleven cities were targeted with leaflets on July 27 , but Hiroshima was not one of them , and there were no leaflet sorties on July 30 . Leaflet sorties were undertaken on August 1 and August 4 . Hiroshima may have been leafleted in late July or early August , as survivor accounts talk about a delivery of leaflets a few days before the atomic bomb was dropped . Three versions were printed of a leaflet listing 11 or 12 cities targeted for firebombing ; a total of 33 cities listed . With the text of this leaflet reading in Japanese `` ... we can not promise that only these cities will be among those attacked ... '' Hiroshima is not listed .
