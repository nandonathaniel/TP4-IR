The French held on to the eastern part of the island , until dealt a serious blow by the Spanish inhabitants of the island at the Battle of Palo Hincado on November 7 , 1808 . With help from the British Navy , the Spanish laid siege to the city of Santo Domingo . The siege lasted almost nine months , during which the besieged suffered greatly from want of provisions , being reduced to eating horses , donkeys , cats , dogs , and rats . In the sixth and seven months of the siege the city was repeatedly bombarded from land and sea , but without result . The French in the besieged city finally capitulated on July 9 , 1809 , initiating a twelve - year period of Spanish rule , known in Dominican history as `` the Foolish Spain . ''
