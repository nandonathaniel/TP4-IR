The final consonant of an English word is sometimes doubled in both American and British spelling when adding a suffix beginning with a vowel , for example strip / stripped , which prevents confusion with stripe / striped and shows the difference in pronunciation ( see digraph ) . Generally , this happens only when the word 's final syllable is stressed and when it also ends with a lone vowel followed by a lone consonant . In British English , however , a final - l is often doubled even when the final syllable is unstressed . This exception is no longer usual in American English , seemingly because of Noah Webster . The - ll - spellings are nevertheless still deemed acceptable variants by both Merriam - Webster Collegiate and American Heritage dictionaries .
