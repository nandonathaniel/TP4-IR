The safest way to view the Sun 's disk is by indirect projection . This can be done by projecting an image of the disk onto a white piece of paper or card using a pair of binoculars ( with one of the lenses covered ) , a telescope , or another piece of cardboard with a small hole in it ( about 1 mm diameter ) , often called a pinhole camera . The projected image of the Sun can then be safely viewed ; this technique can be used to observe sunspots , as well as eclipses . Care must be taken , however , to ensure that no one looks through the projector ( telescope , pinhole , etc . ) directly . Viewing the Sun 's disk on a video display screen ( provided by a video camera or digital camera ) is safe , although the camera itself may be damaged by direct exposure to the Sun . The optical viewfinders provided with some video and digital cameras are not safe . Securely mounting # 14 welder 's glass in front of the lens and viewfinder protects the equipment and makes viewing possible . Professional workmanship is essential because of the dire consequences any gaps or detaching mountings will have . In the partial eclipse path , one will not be able to see the corona or nearly complete darkening of the sky . However , depending on how much of the Sun 's disk is obscured , some darkening may be noticeable . If three - quarters or more of the sun is obscured , then an effect can be observed by which the daylight appears to be dim , as if the sky were overcast , yet objects still cast sharp shadows .
