Once a case is decided , the same plaintiff can not sue the same defendant again on any claim arising out of the same facts . The law requires plaintiffs to put all issues on the table in a single case , not split the case . For example , in a case of an auto accident , the plaintiff can not sue first for property damage , and then personal injury in a separate case . This is called res judicata or claim preclusion ( `` ' Res judicata ' '' is the traditional name going back centuries ; the name shifted to `` claim preclusion '' in the United States over the late 20th century ) . Claim preclusion applies regardless of the plaintiff wins or loses the earlier case , even if the later case raises a different legal theory , even the second claim is unknown at the time of the first case . Exceptions are extremely limited , for example if the two claims for relief must necessarily be brought in different courts ( for example , one claim might be exclusively federal , and the other exclusively state ) .
