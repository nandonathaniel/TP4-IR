Thomas ( Blake Robbins ) and Peter Halpert ( Tug Coker ) are Jim 's obnoxious older brothers who , like him , possess a great love for practical jokes . They first appear in `` Employee Transfer '' , in which they have lunch with their brother and his fianc√©e . However , unbeknownst to Jim , Pam met with them before lunch to clue them in on a prank she would be playing on him , but Tom and Pete instead decided to make fun of her interest in art , as opposed to Pam 's idea of losing her engagement ring . During lunch , they make numerous insults towards her art career , causing Jim to come to her defense . After the argument escalates , Tom and Pete reveal it to be a prank , with Pam awkwardly confirming this . Afterward , Jim receives a text message from them welcoming Pam into the family , and Pam suggests they should `` prank '' Tom about being bald over Thanksgiving . They later reappear in `` Niagara '' , attending Jim and Pam 's wedding , for which they ( along with Michael and Dwight ) organize to have everyone dance down the aisle in the style of the viral video , JK Wedding Entrance Dance .
