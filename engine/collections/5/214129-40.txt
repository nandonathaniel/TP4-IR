Each of the slow loris species that had been identified prior to 2012 is listed as either `` Vulnerable '' or `` Endangered '' on the IUCN Red List . The three newest species are yet to be evaluated , but they arise from ( and further reduce the ranks of ) what was thought to be a single `` vulnerable '' species . All four of these are expected to be listed with at least the same , if not a higher - risk , conservation status . All slow lorises are threatened by the wildlife trade and habitat loss . Their habitat is rapidly disappearing and becoming fragmented , making it nearly impossible for slow lorises to disperse between forest fragments ; unsustainable demand from the exotic pet trade and from traditional medicine has been the greatest cause for their decline . Deep - rooted beliefs about the supernatural powers of slow lorises , such as their purported abilities to ward off evil spirits or to cure wounds , have popularized their use in traditional medicine . Despite local laws prohibiting trade in slow lorises and slow loris products , as well as protection from international commercial trade under Appendix I , slow lorises are openly sold in animal markets in Southeast Asia and smuggled to other countries , such as Japan . Due in part to the large eyes that are an adaptation to their nocturnal lifestyle , they have also been popularized as ' cute ' pets in viral videos on YouTube . Slow lorises have their teeth cut or pulled out for the pet trade . They make poor pets that are difficult to care for , and often die from infection , blood loss , improper caring and handling or inadequate nutrition .
