The Nile leaves Lake Nyanza ( Victoria ) at Ripon Falls near Jinja , Uganda , as the Victoria Nile . It flows north for some 130 kilometers ( 81 mi ) , to Lake Kyoga . The last part of the approximately 200 kilometers ( 120 mi ) river section starts from the western shores of the lake and flows at first to the west until just south of Masindi Port , where the river turns north , then makes a great half circle to the east and north until Karuma Falls . For the remaining part it flows merely westerly through the Murchison Falls until it reaches the very northern shores of Lake Albert where it forms a significant river delta . The lake itself is on the border of DR Congo , but the Nile is not a border river at this point . After leaving Lake Albert , the river continues north through Uganda and is known as the Albert Nile .
