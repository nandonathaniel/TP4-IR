Though John Keats shared Byron and Shelley 's radical politics , `` his best poetry is not political '' , but is especially noted for its sensuous music and imagery , along with a concern with material beauty and the transience of life . Among his most famous works are `` Ode to a Nightingale '' , `` Ode on a Grecian Urn '' , `` , `` To Autumn '' . Keats has always been regarded as a major Romantic , `` and his stature as a poet has grown steadily through all changes of fashion '' .
