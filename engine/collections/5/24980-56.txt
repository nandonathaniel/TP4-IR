UB40 recorded their rendition for their album of cover versions , Labour of Love . According to the band , they were only familiar with Tony Tribe 's version ( they apparently did n't realise that the writer , credited simply as `` Diamond '' , was in fact Neil Diamond ) , and their version featured a lighter , reggae - style flavor compared to Diamond 's somber , acoustic ballad . The UB40 version adds a toasted verse by UB40 member Astro , opening : `` Red Red Wine , you make me feel so fine / You keep me rocking all of the time '' , which was edited from the single that reached number one on the UK Singles Chart in August 1983 and number 34 in the United States in March 1984 but not from the version that reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100 a few months after being performed at the Nelson Mandela 70th Birthday Concert in 1988 . In September 2014 , the Official Charts Company announced that sales in the UK had reached one million .
