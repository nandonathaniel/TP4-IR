The Lemon test has been criticized by justices and legal scholars , but it remains the predominant means by which the Court enforces the Establishment Clause . In Agostini v. Felton ( 1997 ) , the entanglement prong of the Lemon test was demoted to simply being a factor in determining the effect of the challenged statute or practice . In Zelman v. Simmons - Harris ( 2002 ) , the opinion of the Court considered secular purpose and the absence of primary effect ; a concurring opinion saw both cases as having treated entanglement as part of the primary purpose test . Further tests , such as the endorsement test and coercion test , have been developed to determine whether a government action violated the Establishment Clause .
