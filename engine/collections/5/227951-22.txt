Medieval Christian art often depicted the Edenic Serpent as a woman ( often identified as Lilith ) , thus both emphasizing the Serpent 's seductiveness as well as its relationship to Eve . Several early Church Fathers , including Clement of Alexandria and Eusebius of Caesarea , interpreted the Hebrew `` Heva '' as not only the name of Eve , but in its aspirated form as `` female serpent .
