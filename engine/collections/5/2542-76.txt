The chorus of Nicki Minaj 's 2014 single `` Anaconda '' heavily samples the song , including the beat , the lyric `` My anaconda do n't want none unless you got buns hun '' as well as `` Oh my god , look at her butt '' in the beginning of the song . The song 's closing line , `` little in the middle but she got much back '' , is also sampled . Sir Mix - a-Lot stated his approval for Minaj 's song , saying that he had gained `` a whole new level of respect for her '' and that he had become a `` fan for life '' of Minaj .
