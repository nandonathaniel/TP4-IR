To compete in the Olympics , Derice and his best friend , Sanka Coffie , a champion push cart racer , seek out Irv Blitzer , an old friend of Derice 's father Ben who tried to recruit sprinters to the bobsled team years ago . Irving is an American bobsled two time Gold Medalist at the 1968 Winter Olympics who finished first in two events again during the 1972 Winter Olympics but was disqualified from the latter for cheating and retired in disgrace to Jamaica , where he leads an impoverished life as a bookie . Derice 's persistence eventually convinces Irving to be their coach and return to the life he left behind . They eventually recruit Junior and Yul , though Yul is still upset over Junior 's mistake at the Olympic Trial .
