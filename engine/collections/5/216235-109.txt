Two years into his presidency , Monroe faced an economic crisis known as the Panic of 1819 , the first major depression to hit the country since the ratification of the Constitution in 1788 . The panic stemmed from declining imports and exports , and sagging agricultural prices as global markets readjusted to peacetime production and commerce in the aftermath of the War of 1812 and the Napoleonic Wars . The severity of the economic downturn in the U.S. was compounded by excessive speculation in public lands , fueled by the unrestrained issue of paper money from banks and business concerns . Monroe lacked the power to intervene directly in the economy , as banks were largely regulated by the states , and he could do little to stem the economic crisis .
