The origins of the British national debt can be found during the reign of William III , who engaged a syndicate of City traders and merchants to offer for sale an issue of government debt . This syndicate soon evolved into the Bank of England , eventually financing the wars of the Duke of Marlborough and later Imperial conquests . The national debt increased dramatically during and after the Napoleonic Wars , rising to around 200 % of GDP . Over the course of the 19th century the national debt gradually fell , only to see large increases again during World War I and World War II . After the war , the national debt once again slowly fell as a proportion of GDP .
