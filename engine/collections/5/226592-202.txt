Great Britain provided the legal and cultural foundations that enabled entrepreneurs to pioneer the industrial revolution . Key factors fostering this environment were : ( 1 ) The period of peace and stability which followed the unification of England and Scotland ; ( 2 ) no trade barriers between England and Scotland ; ( 3 ) the rule of law ( enforcing property rights and respecting the sanctity of contracts ) ; ( 4 ) a straightforward legal system that allowed the formation of joint - stock companies ( corporations ) ; ( 5 ) absence of tolls , which had largely disappeared from Britain by the 15th century , but were an extreme burden on goods elsewhere in the world , and ( 6 ) a free market ( capitalism ) .
