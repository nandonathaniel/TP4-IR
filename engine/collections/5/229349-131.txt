In this jurisdiction , a number of statutory measures have re-interpreted the right to silence , such as the Criminal Justice Act 1984 , the Criminal Justice ( Drug Trafficking ) Act , 1998 and the Offences Against the State ( Amendment ) Act , 1998 . The general effect of some of these measures is to provide for adverse inferences to be drawn against a suspect who declines to answer questions while being questioned in Garda custody . The Criminal Justice Act 2006 also affects the right to silence , in that it permits inferences to be drawn from silence where no solicitor is present .
