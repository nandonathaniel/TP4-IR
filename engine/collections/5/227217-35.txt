The earliest macrofossils to bear water - transport tubes are Silurian plants placed in the genus Cooksonia . The early Devonian pretracheophytes Aglaophyton and Horneophyton have structures very similar to the hydroids of modern mosses . Plants continued to innovate new ways of reducing the resistance to flow within their cells , thereby increasing the efficiency of their water transport . Bands on the walls of tubes , in fact apparent from the early Silurian onwards , are an early improvisation to aid the easy flow of water . Banded tubes , as well as tubes with pitted ornamentation on their walls , were lignified and , when they form single celled conduits , are considered to be tracheids . These , the `` next generation '' of transport cell design , have a more rigid structure than hydroids , allowing them to cope with higher levels of water pressure . Tracheids may have a single evolutionary origin , possibly within the hornworts , uniting all tracheophytes ( but they may have evolved more than once ) .
