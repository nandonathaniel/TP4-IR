Following much pre-match speculation , Monaco captain Ludovic Giuly took up a central attacking position from the start , and four times in the opening three minutes his pace nearly caught Porto cold . On three occasions , the experience of his opposite number Jorge Costa was just enough to keep him at bay as he darted through , but once , from Lucas Bernardi 's searching pass , Vítor Baía had to race from his goalline to effect a risky last - ditch tackle . Giuly was now coming into his own with some deft touches on the edge of the Porto area , setting up Édouard Cissé , whose cross was tantalisingly out of reach of Bernardi 's outstretched leg , then providing Jérôme Rothen with a chance to cross from the other flank , but this time Fernando Morientes was just out of range .
