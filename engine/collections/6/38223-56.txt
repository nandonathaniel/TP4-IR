Camazotz -- A planet of extreme , enforced conformity , ruled by a disembodied brain called IT . Camazotz is similar to Earth , with familiar trees such as birches , pines , and maples , an ordinary hill on which the children arrive , and a town with smokestacks , which `` might have been one of any number of familiar towns '' . The horror of the place arises from its ordinary appearance , endlessly duplicated . Thus , the houses are `` all exactly alike , small square boxes painted gray '' ; this characterization has been compared with `` the burgeoning American suburbia '' such as the post-war housing developments of Levittown , Pennsylvania . The people who live in the houses are similarly described , with `` mother figures '' who `` all gave the appearance of being the same '' . Camazotz has also been compared with `` an early sixties American image of life in a Communist state '' , a characterization partially dismissed as too glib . The name Camazotz refers to a Mayan bat god , one of L'Engle's many mythological allusions in her nomenclature . It is also stated that Camazotz is a planet that has `` given in '' to the Black Thing , implying that it was not always the dystopian place that it is at present .
