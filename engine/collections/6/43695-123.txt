Pliny the Elder theorized that Julius Caesar 's name came from an ancestor who was born by caesarean section , but the truth of this is debated ( see the discussion of the etymology of Caesar ) . The Ancient Roman caesarean section was first performed to remove a baby from the womb of a mother who died during childbirth . Julius Caesar 's mother , Aurelia , lived through childbirth and successfully gave birth to her son , ruling out the possibility the Roman ruler and general was born by caesarean section . His first wife , however , died in childbirth , giving birth to a stillborn son who might have lived had a caesarean taken place .
