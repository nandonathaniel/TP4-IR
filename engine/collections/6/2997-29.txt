After England were appointed tournament hosts on 28 July 2009 , the proposed stadia for the tournament were revealed . The final venues were confirmed , along with the tournament 's schedule , on 2 May 2013 . Twelve of the stadia were located in England , while the Millennium Stadium located in Wales was also to be used . In 2011 , the IRB approved the use of the Millennium Stadium , despite being outside of the host country , due to its capacity and strategic location . Of the thirteen venues , two were dedicated rugby union grounds ( Kingsholm Stadium and Sandy Park ) , two were national rugby stadia ( Twickenham and the Millennium Stadium ) , two were multi-purpose stadia ( Wembley Stadium and Olympic Stadium ) , and the remainder were association football grounds .
