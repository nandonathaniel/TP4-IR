Operation Magistral , has been one of the final offensive operations undertaken by the Soviets ; a successful sweep operation that cleared the road between Gardez and Khost . This operation did not have any lasting effect on the outcome of the conflict nor the soiled political and military status of the Soviets in the eyes of the West , but was a symbolic gesture that marked the end of their widely condemned presence in the country with a victory .
