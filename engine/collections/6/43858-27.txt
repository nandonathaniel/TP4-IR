The current NHL team in the Bay Area , the San Jose Sharks , has a historical connection to the Seals . Years after the Barons - North Stars merger , the Gunds wanted to bring hockey back to the Bay Area . They asked the NHL for permission to move the North Stars there in the late 1980s , but the league was unwilling to abandon a traditional hockey market like the Twin Cities . Meanwhile , a group led by former Hartford Whalers owner Howard Baldwin was pushing the NHL to bring a team to San Jose , where an arena was being built . Eventually , a compromise was struck whereby the Gunds would sell their share of the North Stars to Baldwin 's group , with the Gunds receiving an expansion team in the Bay Area to begin play in the 1991 -- 92 season . In return , the Sharks would have the rights to players from the North Stars and then participate with the North Stars as an equal partner in an expansion draft with the new franchise . On May 5 , 1990 , the Gunds officially sold their share of the North Stars to Baldwin and were awarded a new team in the Bay Area that eventually became the Sharks . Ironically , in their first two seasons in the league , the Sharks played their home games at the Cow Palace in Daly City ( the same facility the NHL rejected as a home for the Seals in 1967 ) while their new permanent home arena in San Jose was being completed .
