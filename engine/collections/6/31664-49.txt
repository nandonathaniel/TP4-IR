The next election for the Bundestag was on 22 September 2002 . Gerhard Schröder led the coalition of SPD and Greens to an eleven - seat victory over the Christian Democrat challengers headed by Edmund Stoiber ( CSU ) . Three factors are generally cited that enabled Schröder to win the elections despite poor approval ratings a few months before and a weaker economy : good handling of the 100 - year flood , firm opposition to the US 2003 invasion of Iraq , and Stoiber 's unpopularity in the east , which cost the CDU crucial seats there .
