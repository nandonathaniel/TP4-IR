The International Space Station also uses solar arrays to power everything on the station . The 262,400 solar cells cover around 27,000 square feet ( 2,500 m ) of space . There are four sets of solar arrays that power the station and the fourth set of arrays were installed in March 2009 . 84 to 120 kilowatts of electricity can be generated from these solar arrays .
