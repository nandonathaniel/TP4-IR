Most of Addison 's past is presented in a non-linear fashion , primarily revealed in the second season of Grey 's Anatomy and the second and third season of Private Practice . Addison is the daughter of wealthy parents , and has a $25 million trust fund . Addison 's father is nicknamed `` The Captain '' and is a doctor who teaches medicine at a university where Addison would sit and watch as a child . Her father used spending time with his daughter as a pretense for his many affairs . Addison 's mother is Beatrice `` Bizzy '' Forbes Montgomery and her brother , Archer , is a world - class neurologist and successful author . Addison met her future husband , Derek Shepherd , in medical school . Although never actually stated in the series , this would mean that she attended Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons in New York City . She met future colleagues Sam and Naomi Bennett there as well . Addison and Derek each began their own practice in New York City , which placed a strain on their marriage . Their marriage was troubled in the years leading to Derek 's decision to leave New York as it is eventually revealed in both Grey 's Anatomy and Private Practice that Derek 's mother did not approve of her ( choosing to give her dead husband 's ring to Derek 's second wife , Meredith Grey ) and Addison 's brother Archer disliked Derek . Derek later admitted that he was at fault as he was an absent husband . Addison 's affair with Derek 's best friend Mark Sloan drove the wedge even further and Derek 's departure to Seattle . Addison briefly attempted to have a relationship with Mark , which resulted in her becoming pregnant . She had an abortion as she was still in love with Derek , and when Mark cheated on her , she moved to Seattle .
