The Austro - Hungarian authorities encouraged the subsequent anti-Serb riots in Sarajevo , in which Bosnian Croats and Bosniaks killed two Bosnian Serbs and damaged numerous Serb - owned buildings . Violent actions against ethnic Serbs were also organised outside Sarajevo , in other cities in Austro - Hungarian - controlled Bosnia and Herzegovina , Croatia and Slovenia . Austro - Hungarian authorities in Bosnia and Herzegovina imprisoned and extradited approximately 5,500 prominent Serbs , 700 to 2,200 of whom died in prison . A further 460 Serbs were sentenced to death . A predominantly Bosniak special militia known as the Schutzkorps was established and carried out the persecution of Serbs .
