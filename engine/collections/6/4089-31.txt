Perhaps the strongest inspiration for Hurston 's writing of Their Eyes Were Watching God was her former lover Percival Punter . Hurston writes in her autobiography that the romance between Janie and Tea Cake was inspired by a tumultuous love affair . She described falling in love with the man as `` a parachute jump '' . Like Janie in the novel , Hurston was significantly older than her lover . Like Tea Cake , Punter was sexually dominant and sometimes violent . Hurston wrote Their Eyes Were Watching God three weeks after the tumultuous conclusion of her relationship with Punter . She wrote in her autobiography that she had `` tried to embalm all the tenderness of ( her ) passion for him . '' With this emotional inspiration , Hurston went on to paint the picture of Their Eyes Were Watching God using her personal experience and research as a template .
