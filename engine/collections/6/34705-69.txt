The German Empire created several short - lived satellite buffer states within its sphere of influence after the Treaty of Brest - Litovsk : the `` United Baltic Duchy '' , `` Duchy of Courland and Semigallia '' , `` Kingdom of Lithuania '' , `` Kingdom of Poland '' , the `` Belarusian People 's Republic '' , and the `` Ukrainian State '' . Following the defeat of Germany in World War I in November 1918 , these states were abolished .
