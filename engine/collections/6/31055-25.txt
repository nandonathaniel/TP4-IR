Atoms of chemically pure elements may bond to each other chemically in more than one way , allowing the pure element to exist in multiple chemical structures ( spatial arrangements of atoms ) , known as allotropes , which differ in their properties . For example , carbon can be found as diamond , which has a tetrahedral structure around each carbon atom ; graphite , which has layers of carbon atoms with a hexagonal structure stacked on top of each other ; graphene , which is a single layer of graphite that is very strong ; fullerenes , which have nearly spherical shapes ; and carbon nanotubes , which are tubes with a hexagonal structure ( even these may differ from each other in electrical properties ) . The ability of an element to exist in one of many structural forms is known as ' allotropy ' .
