Physics is a branch of fundamental science , not practical science . Physics is also called `` the fundamental science '' because the subject of study of all branches of natural science like chemistry , astronomy , geology , and biology are constrained by laws of physics , similar to how chemistry is often called the central science because of its role in linking the physical sciences . For example , chemistry studies properties , structures , and reactions of matter ( chemistry 's focus on the atomic scale distinguishes it from physics ) . Structures are formed because particles exert electrical forces on each other , properties include physical characteristics of given substances , and reactions are bound by laws of physics , like conservation of energy , mass , and charge .
