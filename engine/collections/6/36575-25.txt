Tullece ( ターレス , Tāresu , `` Turles '' in the FUNimation dub ) is the featured supervillain in this film and the evil doppleganger of Goku . He is a low class Saiyan with somewhat grey skin and bears a striking resemblance to Goku , and can be considered an alternate version of Goku if he had never found peace on Earth , however , his in - universe story has varied from dub to dub . In some dubs their resemblance to each other is because when it came to identifying the lower class breed of saiyans many of them would look alike ( Not all , as Bardock 's team did not look the same , and Gohan does not have the same look as Goku , although his brother , Goten , does ) , yet , on other dubs , Tullece is simply the long lost twin brother of Goku sent on a mission like Goku was before the fall of the Saiyan planet by the hands of Freeza . In the German dub of Bardock -- The Father of Goku , Bardock mentions Tullece is his brother . Rather than Tullece being Goku 's brother , and he is his uncle instead .
