During the inaugural season of the Panthers , the team had an official fight song , which the team played before each home game . The song , `` Stand and Cheer '' , remains the team 's official fight song , but the team does not typically play it before home games . Due to negative fan reaction `` Stand and Cheer '' was pulled in 1999 . Since 2006 , the song has returned . The team plays Neil Diamond 's `` Sweet Caroline '' after home victories . A `` keep pounding '' chant was introduced during the 2015 season which starts before the opening kickoff of each home game . As prompted by the video boards , one side of the stadium shouts `` keep '' and the other side replies with `` pounding '' . The chant is similar to ones that take place at college football games .
