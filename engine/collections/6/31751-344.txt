Mainline American Protestant denominations , including the United Methodist Church , Presbyterian Church USA , The Episcopal Church , and Evangelical Lutheran Church in America , do not teach the doctrine of inerrancy as set forth in the Chicago Statement . All of these churches have more ancient doctrinal statements asserting the authority of scripture , but may interpret these statements in such a way as to allow for a very broad range of teaching -- from evangelicalism to skepticism . It is not an impediment to ordination in these denominations to teach that the scriptures contain errors , or that the authors follow a more or less unenlightened ethics that , however appropriate it may have seemed in the authors ' time , moderns would be very wrong to follow blindly .
