Any top - down effects that do occur will be limited in strength because soil food webs are donor controlled . Donor control means that consumers have little or no effect on the renewal or input of their resources . For example , aboveground herbivores can overgraze an area and decrease the grass population , but decomposers can not directly influence the rate of falling plant litter . They can only indirectly influence the rate of input into their system through nutrient recycling which , by helping plants to grow , eventually creates more litter and detritus to fall . If the entire soil food web were completely donor controlled , however , bacterivores and fungivores would never greatly affect the bacteria and fungi they consume .
