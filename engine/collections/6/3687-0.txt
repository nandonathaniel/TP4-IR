The Comma Johanneum , also called the Johannine Comma or the Heavenly Witnesses , is a comma ( a short clause ) found in Latin manuscripts of the First Epistle of John at 5 : 7 -- 8 . The comma first appeared in the Vulgate manuscripts of the 9th century . The first Greek manuscript that contains the comma dates from the 15th century . The comma is absent from the Ethiopic , Aramaic , Syriac , Slavic , Armenian , Georgian , and Arabic translations of the Greek New Testament . The scholarly consensus is that that passage is a Latin corruption that entered the Greek manuscript tradition in some subsequent copies . As the comma does not appear in the manuscript tradition of other languages , the debate is mainly limited to the English - speaking world due to the King James Only movement .
