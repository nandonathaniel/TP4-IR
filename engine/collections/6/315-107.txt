As a result of the Labor Party 's split over conscription , Billy Hughes and his supporters were expelled from the Labor Party in November 1916 . He subsequently continued on as prime minister at the head of the new National Labor Party , which had only 14 members out of a total of 75 in the House of Representatives . The Commonwealth Liberal Party -- despite still forming the Official Opposition -- provided confidence and supply until February 1917 , when the two parties agree to merge and form the Nationalist Party .
