She attended George Ellery Hale Middle School in Woodland Hills and graduated from El Camino Real High School , also in Woodland Hills , where she was the school mascot . Haddish said she could not read very well until high school , but improved when she received tutoring from a teacher . She also got in a lot of trouble at school , despite her award - winning participation in drama competition featuring Shakespearean monologues . In 1997 , after her social worker gave her an ultimatum to either attend psychiatric therapy or go to the Laugh Factory Comedy Camp , then 17 - year - old Haddish opted for comedy as outlet for her pain . She has said that the mentorship from many notable comedians -- including Richard Pryor , Dane Cook , Charles Fleischer , the Wayans brothers -- helped her discover her passion for comedy and it `` literally saved her life . '' She has said that she incorporates her past real life experiences in her sets , finding that doing so functions as a sort of `` safe space '' for her .
