Opposition was especially strong against the idea of women speaking to audiences of both men and women . Frances Wright , a Scottish woman , was subjected to sharp criticism for delivering public lectures in the U.S. in 1826 and 1827 . When the Grimké sisters , who had been born into a slave - holding family in South Carolina , spoke against slavery throughout the northeast in the mid-1830s , the ministers of the Congregational Church , a major force in that region , published a statement condemning their actions . Despite the disapproval , in 1838 Angelina Grimké spoke against slavery before the Massachusetts legislature , the first woman in the U.S. to speak before a legislative body .
