Psychoanalysis is a set of theories and therapeutic techniques related to the study of the unconscious mind , which together form a method of treatment for mental - health disorders . The discipline was established in the early 1890s by Austrian neurologist Sigmund Freud and stemmed partly from the clinical work of Josef Breuer and others .
