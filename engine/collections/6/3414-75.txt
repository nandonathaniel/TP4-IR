At a given temperature , the composition of a pure carbonic acid solution ( or of a pure CO solution ) is completely determined by the partial pressure p CO 2 ( \ displaystyle p_ ( ( \ text ( CO ) ) _ ( 2 ) ) ) of carbon dioxide above the solution . To calculate this composition , account must be taken of the above equilibria between the three different carbonate forms ( H CO , HCO and CO ) , as well as of the hydration equilibrium between dissolved CO and H CO with constant K h = ( H 2 CO 3 ) ( CO 2 ) ( \ displaystyle K_ ( h ) = ( \ tfrac ( ( ( \ text ( H ) ) _ ( 2 ) ( \ text ( CO ) ) _ ( 3 ) ) ) ( ( ( \ text ( CO ) ) _ ( 2 ) ) ) ) ) ( see above ) and of the following equilibrium between the dissolved CO and the gaseous CO above the solution :
