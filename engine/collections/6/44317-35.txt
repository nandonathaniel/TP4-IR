In Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows , Flitwick insists that Rowena Ravenclaw 's Diadem is lost , and he is described by Harry ( along with Dumbledore ) as having been a `` model student '' who supposedly never entered the Room of Hidden Things , and so it never occurred to him that the diadem could be hidden there . Before the Battle of Hogwarts , Flitwick helps to put protective charms around the castle to hinder Lord Voldemort and his oncoming Death Eaters , and later fights the intruders in the battle , battling Corban Yaxley and later defeating Dolohov .
