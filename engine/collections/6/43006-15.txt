On April 25 , 1886 , a circular letter was issued by Adolph Strasser of the Cigar Makers and P.J. McGuire of the Carpenters , addressed to all national trade unions and calling for their attendance of a conference in Philadelphia on May 18 . The call stated that an element of the Knights of Labor was doing `` malicious work '' and causing `` incalculable mischief by arousing antagonisms and dissensions in the labor movement . '' The call was signed by Strasser and McGuire , along with representatives of the Granite Cutters , the Iron Molders , and the secretary of the Federation of Trades of North America , a forerunner of the A.F. of L. founded in 1881 .
