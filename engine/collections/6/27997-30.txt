On March 30 , 1970 , at 12 : 10 a.m. at the Meadow Stud in Caroline County , Virginia , Somethingroyal foaled a bright - red chestnut colt with three white socks and a star with a narrow stripe . The foal stood when he was 45 minutes old and nursed 30 minutes later . Howard Gentry , the manager of Meadow Stud , was at the foaling and later said , `` He was a very well - made foal . He was as perfect a foal that I ever delivered .

He was a clown and was always cutting up , always into some devilment . '' Some time later , Chenery got her first look at the foal and made a one word entry in her notebook : `` Wow ! ''
