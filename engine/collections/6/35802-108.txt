Although modern fantasy may often embrace strangeness , A Song of Ice and Fire series is generally praised for what is perceived as a sort of medieval realism . Believing that magic should be used moderately in the epic fantasy genre , Martin set out to make the story feel more like historical fiction than contemporary fantasy , with less emphasis on magic and sorcery and more on battles , political intrigue , and the characters . Though the amount of magic has gradually increased throughout the story , the series is still to end with less overt magic than most contemporary fantasies . In Martin 's eyes , literary effective magic needs to represent strange and dangerous forces beyond human comprehension , not advanced alien technologies or formulaic spells . As such , the characters understand only the natural aspects of their world , but not the magical elements like the Others .
