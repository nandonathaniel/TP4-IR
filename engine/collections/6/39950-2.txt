On December 7 , 1941 , the Empire of Japan launched an attack on the US naval and army base on Pearl Harbor in Hawaii , beginning a war between Japan and the United States . Japan had not informed its ally , Germany , in advance of the attack , although the Japanese ambassador had informed the German Foreign Minister , Joachim von Ribbentrop , at the beginning of December that relations between the US and the Japanese Empire were at a breaking point , and that war was imminent . He was instructed to ask Germany for commitment to declare war under the terms of the Tripartite Pact should that occur . Hitler and Ribbentrop had been urging Japan to attack and take over Singapore from the British , on the theory that doing so would not only hurt the UK , but would also serve to help keep the US out of the war .
