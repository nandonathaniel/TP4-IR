DC Universe # 0 features an unnamed narrator who initially associates himself with `` everything '' . As the story progresses , he begins to recall his past and association with Justice League members , particularly Hal Jordan and Superman . The lettering in which he speaks to the reader is yellow on backgrounds that are initially black . As the story moves forward , the background slowly begins turning red . In the final pages , the narration boxes feature a yellow lightning bolt . Over time , as he recalls friendships and connections with other people , his mind begins to narrow , remarking `` I ... know him . I am no longer everything . I am a shaft of light split through a prism '' . Yet he is still the only one able to see `` the shadow falling over everything '' , in the form of Darkseid . On the final page , the moon appears in front of a red sky , as a yellow lightning bolt strikes diagonally in front of it creating the logo of the Flash , as he remarks `` and now I remember '' . The title of the story is revealed to be `` Let There Be Lightning '' .
