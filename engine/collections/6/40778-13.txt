While Prohibition was successful in reducing the amount of liquor consumed , it stimulated the proliferation of rampant underground , organized and widespread criminal activity . Many were astonished and disenchanted with the rise of spectacular gangland crimes ( such as Chicago 's Saint Valentine 's Day Massacre in 1929 ) , belying the claim that prohibition would reduce crime . Prohibition lost its advocates one by one , while the wet opposition talked of personal liberty , new tax revenues from legal beer and liquor , and the scourge of organized crime .
