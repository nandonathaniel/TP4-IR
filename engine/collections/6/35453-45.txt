Without their injured captain the Knicks lost Game 6 , setting up one of the most famous moments in NBA history . Reed limped onto the court before the seventh game , determined to play through the pain of his injury . He scored New York 's first two baskets before going scoreless for the remainder of the contest . Although he was not at full strength , Reed 's heroics inspired the Knicks , and they won the game by a score of 113 -- 99 , allowing New York to capture the title that had eluded them for so long . Reed , who had been named the All - Star MVP and the league 's MVP that season , was named MVP of the Finals , becoming the first player to attain all three awards in a single season .
