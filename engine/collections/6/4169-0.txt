The Oregon Country was a predominantly American term referring to a disputed region of the Pacific Northwest of North America . The region was occupied by British and French Canadian fur traders from before 1810 , and American settlers from the mid-1830s , with its coastal areas north from the Columbia River frequented by ships from all nations engaged in the maritime fur trade , most of these from the 1790s through 1810s being Boston - based . The Oregon Treaty of 1846 ended disputed joint occupancy pursuant to the Treaty of 1818 and established the British - American boundary at the 49th parallel ( except Vancouver Island ) .
