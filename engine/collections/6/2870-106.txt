After his awakening , the Buddha met Taphussa and Bhallika -- two merchant brothers from the city of Balkh in what is currently Afghanistan -- who became his first lay disciples . It is said that each was given hairs from his head , which are now claimed to be enshrined as relics in the Shwe Dagon Temple in Rangoon , Burma . The Buddha intended to visit Asita , and his former teachers , Alara Kalama and Udaka Ramaputta , to explain his findings , but they had already died .
