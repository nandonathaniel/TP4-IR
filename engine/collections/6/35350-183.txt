Claims that Jefferson fathered Sally Hemings ' children have been debated since 1802 . That year James T. Callender , after being denied a position as postmaster , alleged Jefferson had taken Hemings as a concubine and fathered several children with her . In 1998 , a panel of researchers conducted a Y - DNA study of living descendants of Jefferson 's uncle , Field , and of a descendant of Hemings ' son , Eston Hemings . The results , published in the journal Nature , showed a match with the male Jefferson line . According to the Thomas Jefferson Foundation , since the results of the DNA tests were made public , most historians believe Jefferson had a relationship with Hemings . In 2000 , the Thomas Jefferson Foundation ( TJF ) assembled a team of historians whose report concluded that `` the DNA study ... indicates a high probability that Thomas Jefferson fathered Eston Hemings '' . Other scholars maintain the evidence is insufficient to prove Jefferson 's paternity conclusively . They note the possibility that additional Jefferson males , including his brother Randolph Jefferson and Randolph 's five sons , could have fathered Eston Hemings or Sally Hemings ' other children . After Thomas Jefferson 's death , although not formally manumitted , Sally Hemings was allowed by Jefferson 's daughter Martha to live in Charlottesville as a free woman until her death in 1835 .
