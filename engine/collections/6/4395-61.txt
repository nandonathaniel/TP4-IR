Battle Abbey was founded by William at the site of the battle . According to 12th - century sources , William made a vow to found the abbey , and the high altar of the church was placed at the site where Harold had died . More likely , the foundation was imposed on William by papal legates in 1070 . The topography of the battlefield has been altered by subsequent construction work for the abbey , and the slope defended by the English is now much less steep than it was at the time of the battle ; the top of the ridge has also been built up and levelled . After the Dissolution of the Monasteries , the abbey 's lands passed to secular landowners , who used it as a residence or country house . In 1976 the estate was put up for sale and purchased by the government with the aid of some American donors who wished to honour the 200th anniversary of American independence . The battlefield and abbey grounds are currently owned and administered by English Heritage and are open to the public . The Bayeux Tapestry is an embroidered narrative of the events leading up to Hastings probably commissioned by Odo of Bayeux soon after the battle , perhaps to hang at the bishop 's palace at Bayeux . In modern times annual reenactments of the Battle of Hastings have drawn thousands of participants and spectators to the site of the original battle .
