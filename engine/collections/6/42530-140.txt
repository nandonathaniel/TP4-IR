Following the surrender at Yorktown , the Whig party came to power in Britain and began opening negotiations for a cessation of hostilities . While peace negotiations were being undertaken , British troops in America were restricted from launching further offensives . Prime Minister the Earl of Shelburne was reluctant to accept American independence as a prerequisite for peace , as the British were aware that the French economy was nearly bankrupt , and reinforcements sent to the West Indies could potentially reverse the situation there . He preferred that the colonies accept Dominion status within the Empire , though a similar offer had been rejected by the Americans in 1778 . Negotiations soon began in Paris .
