Neoclassicism in music is a 20th - century movement ; in this case it is the Classical and Baroque musical styles of the 17th and 18th centuries , with their fondness for Greek and Roman themes , that were being revived , not the music of the ancient world itself . ( The early 20th century had not yet distinguished the Baroque period in music , on which Neoclassical composers mainly drew , from what we now call the Classical period . ) The movement was a reaction in the first part of the 20th century to the disintegrating chromaticism of late - Romanticism and Impressionism , emerging in parallel with musical Modernism , which sought to abandon key tonality altogether . It manifested a desire for cleanness and simplicity of style , which allowed for quite dissonant paraphrasing of classical procedures , but sought to blow away the cobwebs of Romanticism and the twilit glimmerings of Impressionism in favour of bold rhythms , assertive harmony and clean - cut sectional forms , coinciding with the vogue for reconstructed `` classical '' dancing and costume in ballet and physical education .
