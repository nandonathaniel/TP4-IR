Offshore drilling is a mechanical process where a wellbore is drilled below the seabed . It is typically carried out in order to explore for and subsequently extract petroleum which lies in rock formations beneath the seabed . Most commonly , the term is used to describe drilling activities on the continental shelf , though the term can also be applied to drilling in lakes , inshore waters and inland seas .
