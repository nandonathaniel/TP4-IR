Research also suggests that diversity has a net positive effect on productivity and economic prosperity . A study by Nathan Nunn , Nancy Qian and Sandra Sequeira found that the Age of Mass Migration ( 1850 -- 1920 ) has had substantially beneficial long - term effects on U.S. economic prosperity : `` locations with more historical immigration today have higher incomes , less poverty , less unemployment , higher rates of urbanization , and greater educational attainment . The long - run effects appear to arise from the persistence of sizeable short - run benefits , including earlier and more intensive industrialization , increased agricultural productivity , and more innovation . '' The authors also find that the immigration had short - term benefits : `` that there is no evidence that these long - run benefits come at short - run costs . In fact , immigration immediately led to economic benefits that took the form of higher incomes , higher productivity , more innovation , and more industrialization . ''
