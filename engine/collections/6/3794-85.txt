Postmillennialism theology dominated American Protestantism in the first half of the 19th century . Postmillennialists believed that Christ will return to earth after the `` millennium '' , which could entail either a literal 1,000 years or a figurative `` long period '' of peace and happiness . Christians thus had a duty to purify society in preparation for that return . This duty extended beyond American borders to include Christian Restorationism . George Fredrickson argues that Postmillennial theology `` was an impetus to the promotion of Progressive reforms , as historians have frequently pointed out . '' During the Second Great Awakening of the 1830s , some diviners expected the millennium to arrive in a few years . By the 1840s , however , the great day had receded to the distant future , and postmillennialism became a more passive religious dimension of the wider middle - class pursuit of reform and progress .
