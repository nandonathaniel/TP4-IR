The guys interact with shoppers while wearing jingle vests , and play another game of `` Do n't I Know You ? '' Punishment : Because of the musical Q went through in `` Stage Fright '' , he makes Joe , Sal , and Murr go through the Fire Academy 's training course in the fourth triple punishment , and the second time with Joe , Sal and Murr as the losers for his revenge from the last punishment . Joe had to take an axe through 1 of 2 roof windows that were either pictures of his wife and dogs or his baby daughter . Murr had to scale down a building on a rappel while being confronted by Sloppy Joe ( as revenge for Q 's punishment in `` Car Sick '' ) , Fat Crow , and the doctor who gave him the prostate exam ( from `` Dark Side of the Moon '' ) along the way . For Sal , he had to climb a ladder to rescue a cat from a tree , but he froze at the start . In the end , Q hosed down all 3 losing jokers until they respected him .
