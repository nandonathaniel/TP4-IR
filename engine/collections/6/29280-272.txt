Three weeks into the invasion , U.S. - led Coalition forces moved into Baghdad . Units of the Iraqi Special Republican Guard led the defence of the city . The rest of the defenders were a mixture of Republican Guard units , regular army units , Fedayeen Saddam , and non-Iraqi Arab volunteers . Initial plans were for Coalition units to surround the city and gradually move in , forcing Iraqi armor and ground units to cluster into a central pocket in the city , and then attack with air and artillery forces .
