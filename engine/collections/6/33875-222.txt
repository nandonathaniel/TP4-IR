Most city dwellers appear to have been traders or artisans , who lived with others pursuing the same occupation in well - defined neighbourhoods . Materials from distant regions were used in the cities for constructing seals , beads and other objects . Among the artefacts discovered were beautiful glazed fa√Øence beads . Steatite seals have images of animals , people ( perhaps gods ) , and other types of inscriptions , including the yet un-deciphered writing system of the Indus Valley Civilisation . Some of the seals were used to stamp clay on trade goods and most probably had other uses as well .
