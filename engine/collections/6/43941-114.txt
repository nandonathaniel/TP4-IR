The move by retailers to begin holiday sales during Thanksgiving Day ( as opposed to the traditional day after ) has been criticized as forcing ( under threat of being fired ) low - end retail workers , who compose an increasing share of the nation 's workforce , to work odd hours and to handle atypical , unruly crowds on a day reserved for rest . In response to this controversy , Macy 's and Best Buy ( both of which planned to open on Thanksgiving , even earlier than they had the year before ) stated in 2014 that most of their Thanksgiving Day shifts were filled voluntarily by employees who would rather have the day after Thanksgiving off instead of Thanksgiving itself . Blue laws in several Northeastern states prevent retailers in those states from opening on Thanksgiving . Such retailers typically open at midnight on the day after Thanksgiving to circumvent the laws as much as legally possible .
