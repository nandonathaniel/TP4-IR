The Philippines has been the most vocal against Chinese incursions in the dispute , even bringing its case against China to a United Nations international tribunal in the Hague , the first case filed by a nation against China . Vietnam , Japan , and other Western countries , especially the United States , have strongly supported the Philippines . Vietnam , bordered both by land and sea with China , has also claims all the Spratly Islands . This dispute focuses on the Paracel Islands , which China has occupied following the Battle of the Paracel Islands , in 1974 . Brunei , claiming only one reef , has been silent on the issue ever since it began , mostly because of its trade with China . Malaysia , a nation with deep economic ties to China , and a nation with billions in Chinese investment , has remained neutral and ' China - friendly ' over the conflict . This despite China claiming various reefs and islands in the Spratlys as well as most of its territorial waters and exclusive economic zones in Borneo .
