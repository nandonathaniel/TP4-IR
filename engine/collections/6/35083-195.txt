This defeat led to the dissolution of the League of Evangelical Union and the loss of Frederick V 's holdings despite the tenacious defence of Trebon , Bohemia ( under Colonel Seton ) until 1622 and Frankenthal ( under Colonel Vere ) the following year . Frederick was outlawed from the Holy Roman Empire , and his territories , the Rhenish Palatinate , were given to Catholic nobles . His title of elector of the Palatinate was given to his distant cousin , Duke Maximilian of Bavaria . Frederick , now landless , made himself a prominent exile abroad and tried to curry support for his cause in Sweden , the Netherlands , and Denmark - Norway .
