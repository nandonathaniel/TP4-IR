The Iron Curtain took physical shape in the form of border defenses between the countries of western and eastern Europe . These were some of the most heavily militarised areas in the world , particularly the so - called `` inner German border '' -- commonly known as die Grenze in German -- between East and West Germany . The inner German border was marked in rural areas by double fences made of steel mesh ( expanded metal ) with sharp edges , while near urban areas a high concrete barrier similar to the Berlin Wall was built . The installation of the Wall in 1961 brought an end to a decade during which the divided capital of divided Germany was one of the easiest places to move west across the Iron Curtain .
