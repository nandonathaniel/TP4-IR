Aram was invited to ride on the horse with Mourad . The idea of Mourad stealing the horse drained away from Aram 's mind as when he felt that it would n't become stealing unless they offer to sell the horse . They enjoyed rides on the horse for a few hours . Mourad 's crazy behavior was considered to be of natural descent from their uncle Khosrov , even though his father , Zorab , was a practical man . Uncle Khosrove was an enormous man who was always furious , impatient , and irritable . He would roar for everyone to stop talking and say It is no harm , pay no attention to it . In fact , one day , when his son came and told them that their house was on fire , Khosrov silenced him by roaring `` Enough . It is no harm '' . After a short time of riding , Mourad wanted to ride alone on the horse . Aram had the same longing , but when he sat on the horse and kicked its muscles it reared and snorted and raced forward , eventually dropping Aram off its back . After half an hour they found the horse and hid it in the barn of a deserted vineyard of a farmer named Fetvajian which had once been his pride .
