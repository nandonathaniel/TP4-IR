In 1396 , at Acamapichtli 's death , his son Huitzilihhuitl ( Nahuatl : `` Hummingbird feather '' ) became ruler , married to Tezozomoc 's daughter the relation with Azcapotzalco remained close . Chimalpopoca ( Nahuatl : `` She smokes like a shield '' ) , son of Huitzilihhuitl , became ruler of Tenochtitlan in 1417 . In 1418 , Azcapotzalco initiated a war against the Acolhua of Texcoco , and killed their ruler Ixtlilxochitl . Even though Ixtlilxochitl was married to Chimalpopoca 's daughter , the Mexica ruler continued to support Tezozomoc . Tezozomoc died in 1426 , and his sons began a struggle for rulership of Azcapotzalco . During this struggle for power Chimalpopoca died , probably killed by Tezozomoc 's son Maxtla who saw him as a competitor .
