Arnold also realized such a flanking maneuver was likely , and petitioned Gates for permission to move his forces from the heights to meet potential movements , where the American skill at woodlands combat would be at an advantage . Gates , whose preferred strategy was to sit and wait for the expected frontal assault , grudgingly permitted a reconnaissance in force consisting of Daniel Morgan 's men and Henry Dearborn 's light infantry . When Morgan 's men reached an open field northwest of Bemis Heights belonging to Loyalist John Freeman , they spotted British advance troops in the field . Fraser 's column was slightly delayed and had not yet reached the field , while Hamilton 's column had also made its way across a ravine and was approaching the field from the east through dense forest and difficult terrain . Riedesel 's force , while it was on the road , was delayed by obstacles thrown down by the Americans . The sound of gunfire to the west prompted Riedesel to send some of his artillery down a track in that direction . The troops Morgan 's men saw were an advance company from Hamilton 's column .
