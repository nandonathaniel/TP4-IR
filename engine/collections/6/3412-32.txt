Some of the failure to shift to more productive agricultural products may be related to ignorance about the benefits of changing land use . A second explanation is a lack of availability of credit , caused by the high rate of failure of banks in the Plains states . Because banks failed in the Dust Bowl region at a higher rate than elsewhere , farmers could not get the credit they needed to buy capital to shift crop production . In addition , profit margins in either animals or hay were still minimal , and farmers had little incentive in the beginning to change their crops .
