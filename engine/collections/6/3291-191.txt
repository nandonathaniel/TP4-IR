Note that the induced EMF method is dependent on the assumption of a sinusoidal current distribution , delivering an accuracy better than about 10 % as long as the wavelength to element diameter ratio is greater than about 60 . However , for yet larger conductors numerical solutions are required which solve for the conductor 's current distribution ( rather than assuming a sinusoidal pattern ) . This can be based on approximating solutions for either Pocklington 's integrodifferential equation or the Hall√©n integral equation . These approaches also have greater generality , not being limited to linear conductors .
