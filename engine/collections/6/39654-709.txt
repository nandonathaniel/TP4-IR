Due to the U2 360 Â° Tour concert scheduled June 29 at Sun Life Stadium and the needed time to set up the stage , the Marlins were forced to move their scheduled home games for June 24 -- 26 against the Seattle Mariners to the Mariners ' park at Safeco Field . As the Marlins were the home team , NL rules ( no designated hitter ) were applied . Mariners and Marlins would not meet again in Miami until 2014 .
