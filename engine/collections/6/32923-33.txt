During the fifth round , Frazier 's timing and the rhythm of his bobbing and weaving improved . He was able to avoid the oncoming fists of the champion and , for the first time in the fight , land solid left hooks to Ali 's head . Ali spent much of the round along the ropes . According to his trainer , Angelo Dundee , this `` was the worst thing he could do because he 's making Joe pick up momentum where he could drive those shots to the body . '' Ali 's method of self - defense also worsened noticeably in the fifth . Boxing journalist Jerry Izenberg , who was ringside , said , `` Somewhere about the 4th or 5th round Joe hit him with a right hand -- I did n't think Joe could tie his shoes with his right hand -- and Ali pulls back and says ' You do n't have no right hand , you ca n't do that . ' and bing ! he hits him with another right hand . Suddenly Ali had to think ' Well there are two hands in this fight on the other side ' -- that was very important . '' His guard also visibly lowered in this round as a result of the vicious body attack he was absorbing . The net effect was that Ali became much more exposed to Frazier 's most lethal punch -- the left hook .
