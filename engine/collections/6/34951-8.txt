A set of K parameters , each specifying the parameter of the corresponding mixture component . In many cases , each `` parameter '' is actually a set of parameters . For example , observations distributed according to a mixture of one - dimensional Gaussian distributions will have a mean and variance for each component . Observations distributed according to a mixture of V - dimensional categorical distributions ( e.g. , when each observation is a word from a vocabulary of size V ) will have a vector of V probabilities , collectively summing to 1 .
