In December 1787 and January 1788 , five states -- Delaware , Pennsylvania , New Jersey , Georgia , and Connecticut -- ratified the Constitution with relative ease , though the bitter minority report of the Pennsylvania opposition was widely circulated . In contrast to its predecessors , the Massachusetts convention was angry and contentious , at one point erupting into a fistfight between Federalist delegate Francis Dana and Anti-Federalist Elbridge Gerry when the latter was not allowed to speak . The impasse was resolved only when revolutionary heroes and leading Anti-Federalists Samuel Adams and John Hancock agreed to ratification on the condition that the convention also propose amendments . The convention 's proposed amendments included a requirement for grand jury indictment in capital cases , which would form part of the Fifth Amendment , and an amendment reserving powers to the states not expressly given to the federal government , which would later form the basis for the Tenth Amendment .
