Unlike the similar command su , users must , by default , supply their own password for authentication , rather than the password of the target user . After authentication , and if the configuration file , which is typically located at / etc / sudoers , permits the user access , the system invokes the requested command . The configuration file offers detailed access permissions , including enabling commands only from the invoking terminal ; requiring a password per user or group ; requiring re-entry of a password every time or never requiring a password at all for a particular command line . It can also be configured to permit passing arguments or multiple commands .
