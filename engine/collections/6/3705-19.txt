Substrates Products Enzyme Reaction type 0 / 10 Oxaloacetate + Acetyl CoA + H O Citrate + CoA - SH Citrate synthase Aldol condensation irreversible , extends the 4C oxaloacetate to a 6C molecule Citrate cis - Aconitate + H O Aconitase Dehydration reversible isomerisation cis - Aconitate + H O Isocitrate Hydration Isocitrate + NAD Oxalosuccinate + NADH + H Isocitrate dehydrogenase Oxidation generates NADH ( equivalent of 2.5 ATP ) Oxalosuccinate α - Ketoglutarate + CO Decarboxylation rate - limiting , irreversible stage , generates a 5C molecule 5 α - Ketoglutarate + NAD + CoA - SH Succinyl - CoA + NADH + H + CO α - Ketoglutarate dehydrogenase Oxidative decarboxylation irreversible stage , generates NADH ( equivalent of 2.5 ATP ) , regenerates the 4C chain ( CoA excluded ) 6 Succinyl - CoA + GDP + P Succinate + CoA - SH + GTP Succinyl - CoA synthetase substrate - level phosphorylation or ADP → ATP instead of GDP → GTP , generates 1 ATP or equivalent Condensation reaction of GDP + P and hydrolysis of Succinyl - CoA involve the H O needed for balanced equation . 7 Succinate + ubiquinone ( Q ) Fumarate + ubiquinol ( QH ) Succinate dehydrogenase Oxidation uses FAD as a prosthetic group ( FAD → FADH in the first step of the reaction ) in the enzyme , generates the equivalent of 1.5 ATP 8 Fumarate + H O L - Malate Fumarase Hydration Hydration of C-C double bond 9 L - Malate + NAD Oxaloacetate + NADH + H Malate dehydrogenase Oxidation reversible ( in fact , equilibrium favors malate ) , generates NADH ( equivalent of 2.5 ATP ) 10 / 0 Oxaloacetate + Acetyl CoA + H O Citrate + CoA - SH Citrate synthase Aldol condensation This is the same as step 0 and restarts the cycle . The reaction is irreversible and extends the 4C oxaloacetate to a 6C molecule
