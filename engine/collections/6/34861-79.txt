There has been an intermediate sprints classification , which from 1984 awarded a red jersey for points awarded to the first three to pass intermediate points during the stage . These sprints also scored points towards the points classification and bonuses towards the general classification . The intermediate sprints classification with its red jersey was abolished in 1989 , but the intermediate sprints have remained , offering points for the points classification and , until 2007 , time bonuses for the general classification .
