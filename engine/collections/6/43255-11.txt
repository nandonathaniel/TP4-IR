Women of the company also performed vital tasks along the way . While much time was spent on traditional activities such as cooking , sewing , and tending children , several women served as scribes and diary keepers . Harriet Page Young , wife of Lorenzo Young , was the first woman selected for the company . She was in ill health and Lorenzo Young feared to leave her and their young children behind . The other original women of the company , Ellen Sanders Kimball , wife of Heber C. Kimball , and Clarissa Decker Young , wife of Brigham Young , were asked to accompany the group to look after Harriet Young and keep her company . The three women were joined by a larger group of women church members from Mississippi who merged with the main party at Laramie , Wyoming .
