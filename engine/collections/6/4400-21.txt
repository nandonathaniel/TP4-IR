Occasionally , when Blue Bell enters a market the company marks the occasion with the introduction of a regional flavor within that market . For example , when it entered Colorado on March 14 , 2011 , Blue Bell introduced a new flavor exclusive to Colorado , Rocky Mountain Road , made with more premium ingredients ( including chocolate - covered nuts and a marshmallow swirl ) compared to its year - round Rocky Road . While the test market was in the Denver metropolitan area , there was speculation that the rest of the state would soon see Blue Bell on store shelves . Eventually , this flavor would be distributed to Blue Bell 's entire sales territory .
