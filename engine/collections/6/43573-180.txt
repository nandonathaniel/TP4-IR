Fewer than a third of those aboard Titanic survived the disaster . Some survivors died shortly afterwards ; injuries and the effects of exposure caused the deaths of several of those brought aboard Carpathia . The figures show stark differences in the survival rates of the different classes aboard Titanic . Although only 3 % of first - class women were lost , 54 % of those in third class died . Similarly , five of six first - class and all second - class children survived , but 52 of the 79 in third class perished . The differences by gender were even bigger : nearly all female crew members , first and second class passengers were saved . Men from the First Class died at a higher rate than women from the Third Class . In total , 50 % of the children survived , 20 % of the men and 75 % of the women .
