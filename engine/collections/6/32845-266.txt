Argentine theatre traces its origins to Viceroy Juan José de Vértiz y Salcedo 's creation of the colony 's first theatre , La Ranchería , in 1783 . In this stage , in 1786 , a tragedy entitled Siripo had its premiere . Siripo is now a lost work ( only the second act is conserved ) , and can be considered the first Argentine stage play , because it was written by Buenos Aires poet Manuel José de Lavardén , it was premiered in Buenos Aires , and its plot was inspired by an historical episode of the early colonization of the Río de la Plata Basin : the destruction of Sancti Spiritu colony by aboriginals in 1529 . La Ranchería theatre operated until its destruction in a fire in 1792 . The second theatre stage in Buenos Aires was Teatro Coliseo , opened in 1804 during the term of Viceroy Rafael de Sobremonte . It was the nation 's longest - continuously operating stage . The musical creator of the Argentine National Anthem , Blas Parera , earned fame as a theatre score writer during the early 19th century . The genre suffered during the regime of Juan Manuel de Rosas , though it flourished alongside the economy later in the century . The national government gave Argentine theatre its initial impulse with the establishment of the Colón Theatre , in 1857 , which hosted classical and operatic , as well as stage performances . Antonio Petalardo 's successful 1871 gambit on the opening of the Teatro Opera , inspired others to fund the growing art in Argentina .
