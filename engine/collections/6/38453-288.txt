In 77 BC , the senate sent one of Sulla 's former lieutenants , Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus ( `` Pompey the Great '' ) , to put down an uprising in Hispania . By 71 BC , Pompey returned to Rome after having completed his mission . Around the same time , another of Sulla 's former lieutenants , Marcus Licinius Crassus , had just put down the Spartacus - led gladiator / slave revolt in Italy . Upon their return , Pompey and Crassus found the populares party fiercely attacking Sulla 's constitution . They attempted to forge an agreement with the populares party . If both Pompey and Crassus were elected consul in 70 BC , they would dismantle the more obnoxious components of Sulla 's constitution . The two were soon elected , and quickly dismantled most of Sulla 's constitution .
