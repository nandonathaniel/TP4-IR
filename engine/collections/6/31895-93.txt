Although Constantinople was retaken by Michael VIII Palaiologos , the Empire had lost many of its key economic resources , and struggled to survive . The palace of Blachernae in the north - west of the city became the main Imperial residence , with the old Great Palace on the shores of the Bosporus going into decline . When Michael VIII captured the city , its population was 35,000 people , but , by the end of his reign , he had succeeded in increasing the population to about 70,000 people . The Emperor achieved this by summoning former residents who had fled the city when the crusaders captured it , and by relocating Greeks from the recently reconquered Peloponnese to the capital . In 1347 , the Black Death spread to Constantinople . In 1453 , when the Ottoman Turks captured the city , it contained approximately 50,000 people .
