At the time , Detroit 's `` Big Three '' automakers ( Ford , Chrysler , GM ) were marketing downsized full - sized automobiles like the Chevrolet Caprice , the Ford LTD Crown Victoria and the Dodge St. Regis which met the CAFE fuel economy mandates passed in 1978 . Detroit 's response to the growing popularity of imported compacts like the Toyota Corolla and the Volkswagen Rabbit were the Chevrolet Citation , and the Ford Fairmont ; Ford replaced the Ford Pinto with the Ford Escort and Chrysler , on the verge of bankruptcy , introduced the Dodge Aries K. GM was having unfavorable market reactions to the Citation , and introduced the Chevrolet Corsica and Chevrolet Beretta in 1987 which did sell better . GM also replaced the Chevrolet Monza , introducing the 1982 Chevrolet Cavalier which was better received . Ford experienced a similar market rejection of the Fairmont , and introduced the front wheel drive Ford Tempo in 1984 .
