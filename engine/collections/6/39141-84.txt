South Australia 's credit rating was upgraded to AAA by Standard & Poor 's Rating Agency in September 2004 and to AAA by Moody 's Rating Agency November 2004 , the highest credit ratings achievable by any company or sovereign . The State had previously lost these ratings in the State Bank collapse . However , in 2012 Standard & Poor 's downgraded the state 's credit rating to AA+ due to declining revenues , new spending initiatives and a weaker than expected budgetary outlook .
