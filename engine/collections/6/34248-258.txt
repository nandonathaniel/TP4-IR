In 1924 , Fédération Internationale des Échecs ( FIDE ) was formed and in 1929 it took up the task of standardizing the rules . At first FIDE tried to establish a universal set of rules , but translations to various languages differed slightly . Although FIDE rules were used for international competition under their control , some countries continued to use their own rules internally ( Hooper & Whyld 1992 : 220 -- 21 ) . In 1952 FIDE created the Permanent Commission for the Rules of Chess ( also known as the Rules Commission ) and published a new edition of the rules . The third official edition of the laws was published in 1966 . The first three editions of the rules were published in French , with that as the official version . In 1974 FIDE published the English version of the rules ( which was based on an authorized 1955 translation ) . With that edition , English became the official language of the rules . Another edition was published in 1979 . Throughout this time , ambiguities in the laws were handed by frequent interpretations that the Rules Commission published as supplements and amendments . In 1982 the Rules Commission rewrote the laws to incorporate the interpretations and amendments ( FIDE 1989 : 7 -- 8 ) . In 1984 FIDE abandoned the idea of a universal set of laws , although FIDE rules are the standard for high - level play ( Hooper & Whyld 1992 : 220 -- 21 ) . With the 1984 edition , FIDE implemented a four - year moratorium between changes to the rules . Other editions were issued in 1988 and 1992 ( FIDE 1989 : 5 ) , ( Just 2014 ) .
