The first classic work about the Tang is the Old Book of Tang by Liu Xu ( 887 -- 946 ) et al. of the Later Jin , who redacted it during the last years of his life . This was edited into another history ( labelled the New Book of Tang ) in order to distinguish it , which was a work by the Song historians Ouyang Xiu ( 1007 -- 1072 ) , Song Qi ( 998 -- 1061 ) , et al. of the Song dynasty ( between the years 1044 and 1060 ) . Both of them were based upon earlier annals , yet those are now lost . Both of them also rank among the Twenty - Four Histories of China . One of the surviving sources of the Old Book of Tang , primarily covering up to 756 , is the Tongdian , which Du You presented to the emperor in 801 . The Tang period was again placed into the enormous universal history text of the Zizhi Tongjian , edited , compiled , and completed in 1084 by a team of scholars under the Song dynasty Chancellor Sima Guang ( 1019 -- 1086 ) . This historical text , written with 3 million Chinese characters in 294 volumes , covered the history of China from the beginning of the Warring States ( 403 BC ) until the beginning of the Song dynasty ( 960 ) .
