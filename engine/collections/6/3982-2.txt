In ecology , common limiting factor resources are environmental conditions that limit the growth , abundance , or distribution of an organism or a population of organisms in an ecosystem . The concept of limiting factors is based on Liebig 's Law of the Minimum , which states that growth is controlled not by the total amount of resources available , but by the scarcest resource . In other words , a factor is limiting if a change in the factor produces increased growth , abundance , or distribution of an organism , when other factors necessary to the organisms life do not . Limiting factors may be physical or biological .
