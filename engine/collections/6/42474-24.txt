One case in New South Wales , Australia ended in the man suing his former fianc√©e because she threw the ring away , after he told her she could keep it even though the marriage plans had fallen through . The Supreme Court of New South Wales held that , despite what the man said , the ring remained a conditional gift ( partly because his saying that she could keep it reflected his desire to salvage the relationship ) and she was ordered to pay him its A $15,250 cost .
