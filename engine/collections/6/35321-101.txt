Computer - generated imagery is `` the application of the field of 3D computer graphics to special effects '' . This technology is used for visual effects because they are high in quality , controllable , and can create effects that would not be feasible using any other technology either because of cost , resources or safety . Computer - generated graphics can be seen in many live action movies today , especially those of the action genre . Further , computer generated imagery has almost completely supplanted hand - drawn animation in children 's movies which are increasingly computer - generated only . Examples of movies that use computer - generated imagery include Finding Nemo , 300 and Iron Man .
