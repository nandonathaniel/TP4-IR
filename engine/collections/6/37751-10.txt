Phase one is depolarization . During depolarization , voltage - gated sodium ion channels open , increasing the neuron 's membrane conductance for sodium ions and depolarizing the cell 's membrane potential ( from typically - 70 mV toward a positive potential ) . In other words , the membrane is made less negative . After the potential reaches the activation threshold ( - 55 mV ) , the depolarization is actively driven by the neuron and overshoots the equilibrium potential of an activated membrane ( + 30 mV ) .
