Organizations have urged a boycott of Starbucks , accusing Starbucks of serving as an ally of Israeli militarists . Starbucks was forced to close a store in Beirut , Lebanon due to demonstrators shouting anti-Israel slogans and causing customers to flee . Demonstrators hung several banners on the shop 's window and used white tape to paste a Star of David over the green - and - white Starbucks sign . They also distributed a letter saying , Schultz `` ... is one of the pillars of the American Jewish lobby and the owner of the Starbucks , '' which they said donates money to the Israeli military .
