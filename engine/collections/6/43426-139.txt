Their white jerseys have provided three basic color combinations , two of which have been previously alluded to in this article . The last combination consists of both white jerseys and pants . That particular combination surfaced in the first game of the 2003 season , when the team was coached by Steve Spurrier , during a nationally televised game against the New York Jets , which led many sports fans and Redskins faithful alike to point out that they had never seen that particular combination before . That year the Redskins wore it two more times . That look did n't appear again until midway through the 2005 season when the Redskins wore it in a road game against the St. Louis Rams . The Redskins won six straight games , including one in the playoffs against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers , wearing that combination and the local media jokingly pointed out that the reason the Redskins were winning was their use of the white over white combination . In the NFC Divisional Playoff game against the eventual 2005 NFC Champion Seattle Seahawks , the Redskins wore the all - white uniforms , in hopes that they could keep their streak going ; however , they lost 20 -- 10 . The Redskins continued to wear the white jerseys and white pants into the 2006 preseason . In the 2006 season , the Redskins started wearing black cleats , something that had n't been done for quite a while . It was a surprise because they wore white cleats during the preseason . They would have to wear that color for the rest of the season , because the NFL usually asks teams to choose either black or white cleats to be worn throughout the season .
