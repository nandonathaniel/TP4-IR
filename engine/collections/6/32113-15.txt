After the President signs a bill into law ( or Congress enacts it over his veto ) , it is delivered to the Office of the Federal Register ( OFR ) of the National Archives and Records Administration ( NARA ) where it is assigned a law number , and prepared for publication as a slip law . Public laws , but not private laws , are also given legal statutory citation by the OFR . At the end of each session of Congress , the slip laws are compiled into bound volumes called the United States Statutes at Large , and they are known as session laws . The Statutes at Large present a chronological arrangement of the laws in the exact order that they have been enacted .
