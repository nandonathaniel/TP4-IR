The initial public offering ( IPO ) market in India has been small compared to NYSE and NASDAQ , raising US $300 million in 2013 and US $1.4 billion in 2012 . Ernst & Young stated that the low IPO activity reflects market conditions , slow government approval processes and complex regulations . Before 2013 , Indian companies were not allowed to list their securities internationally without first completing an IPO in India . In 2013 , these security laws were reformed and Indian companies can now choose where they want to list first : overseas , domestically , or both concurrently . Further , security laws have been revised to ease overseas listings of already - listed companies , to increase liquidity for private equity and international investors in Indian companies .
