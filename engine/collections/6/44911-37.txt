`` Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences , fellow members of the motion picture industry and honored guests : This is one of the happiest moments of my life , and I want to thank each one of you who had a part in selecting me for one of their awards , for your kindness . It has made me feel very , very humble ; and I shall always hold it as a beacon for anything that I may be able to do in the future . I sincerely hope I shall always be a credit to my race and to the motion picture industry . My heart is too full to tell you just how I feel , and may I say thank you and God bless you . ''
