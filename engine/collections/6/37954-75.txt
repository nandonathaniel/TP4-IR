Gwen Ihnat of The A.V. Club gave the film a `` C '' grade , favoring the improved animation over the television series , but adding `` you have to wonder to what use it 's being put '' . Elizabeth Weitzman of TheWrap wrote positively of the film , saying , `` Like its television predecessor , is all dressed up in bubbles and cupcakes and rainbows . But it 's so jam - packed with rousing girl power , it passes the Bechdel Test with ( literally ) flying colors . '' Amy Nicholson of Variety called the film `` at once clich√©d and exceptional '' , praising its female characters and calling the story `` emotionally wise '' .
