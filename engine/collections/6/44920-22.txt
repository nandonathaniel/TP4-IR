The Moscow mule is almost always served in a copper mug . The popularity of this drinking vessel is attributable to Martin , who went around the country to sell Smirnoff vodka and popularize the Moscow mule . Martin asked bartenders to pose with a specialty copper mug and a bottle of Smirnoff vodka , and photographed a Polaroid picture of them . He took two photos , leaving one with the bartender for display . The other photo would be put into a collection and used as proof to the next bar Martin visited of the popularity of the Moscow mule . The copper mug remains , to this day , a popular serving vessel for the Moscow mule .
