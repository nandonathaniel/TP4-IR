A transfer case is a part of the drivetrain of four - wheel - drive , all - wheel - drive , and other multiple powered axle vehicles . The transfer case transfers power from the transmission to the front and rear axles by means of drive shafts . It also synchronizes the difference between the rotation of the front and rear wheels , and may contain one or more sets of low range gears for off - road use .
