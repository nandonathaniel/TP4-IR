At around 5 : 30 p.m. ( EDT ) on April 7 , 2018 , a 4 - alarm fire broke out in a condominium in the tower 's 50th floor , killing a resident and injuring six firefighters ; the apartment was almost entirely engulfed in flames by the time the New York City Fire Department ( FDNY ) arrived . In a Twitter post , Trump attributed the fire 's limited damage to the building 's design . The sole fatality was 67 - year - old Todd Brassner , an art dealer known for his association with Andy Warhol , who had endured debilitating medical problems for several years . Brassner 's apartment , as well as the rest of the residential units in Trump Tower , did not contain sprinklers because the structure had been built before 1999 , when the city passed a law requiring sprinklers in residential units ; Trump had lobbied against the proposal . The FDNY later announced that the fire had been accidentally caused by power wires that had overheated . The April 2018 fire followed a minor electrical fire at the tower earlier that year , which had injured three people .
