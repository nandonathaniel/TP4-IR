Before the release of the film , Bill Condon refilmed one certain sequence in the `` Days of the Sun '' number , due to confusion among test audiences caused by actress Harriet Jones , who looked similar to Hattie Morahan , who portrayed Agathe . In the original version of the scene , it was Jones 's character , the Prince 's mother , who sings the first verse of the song , with Rudi Goodman playing the young Prince and Henry Garrett playing his father ; but in the reshot version of the scene , the singing part is given to the Prince ( now played by Adam Mitchell ) . The King was also recast to Tom Turner , although Harriet Jones was still the Queen , albeit with dark hair . Both Goodman and Garrett 's names were mistakenly featured in the original theatrical release 's credits , but was later corrected in home releases .
