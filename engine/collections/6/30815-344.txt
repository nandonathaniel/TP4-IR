In systems that do not require for their descriptions the general theory of relativity , bodies always have positive heat capacity , meaning that the temperature rises with energy . Therefore , when energy flows from a high - temperature object to a low - temperature object , the source temperature is decreased while the sink temperature is increased ; hence temperature differences tend to diminish over time . This is not always the case for systems in which the gravitational force is important and the general theory of relativity is required . Such systems can spontaneously change towards uneven spread of mass and energy . This applies to the universe in large scale , and consequently it may be difficult or impossible to apply the second law to it . Beyond this , the thermodynamics of systems described by the general theory of relativity is beyond the scope of the present article .
