It is revealed in `` Exiled '' that Sage is from the warlike kingdom of the Mountain Lemurs - he left because he disagrees with their conquering , oppressing ways and chose spiritual peace . Unfortunately , in his absence , his evil brother Koto took over the kingdom and conquered King Julien 's lemurs and all neighboring kingdoms . Sage goes on a quest with Clover to get help , asking for assistance from his mentor , an enigmatic but seemingly crazy mudskipper named Jarsh - Jarsh . In the end , Sage and Clover bond as they realize after a body - swapped experience that they are the perfect weapon , able to balance each other out . Sage defeats Koto in combat , but at Clover 's request spares his life ( though he is squashed under his own statue anyway when he tries to backstab Sage ) .
