The mountain is also of sacred importance to the Cowlitz and Yakama tribes that also historically lived in the area . They find the area above its tree line to be of exceptional spiritual significance , and the mountain ( which they call `` Lawetlat'la '' , roughly translated as `` the smoker '' ) features prominently in their creation myth , and in some of their songs and rituals . In recognition of this cultural significance , over 12,000 acres ( 4,900 ha ) of the mountain ( roughly bounded by the Loowit Trail ) have been listed on the National Register of Historic Places .
