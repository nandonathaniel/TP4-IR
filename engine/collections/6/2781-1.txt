A mantle plume is posited to exist where hot rock nucleates at the core - mantle boundary and rises through the Earth 's mantle becoming a diapir in the Earth 's crust . The currently active volcanic centers are known as hotspots . In particular , the concept that mantle plumes are fixed relative to one another , and anchored at the core - mantle boundary , would provide a natural explanation for the time - progressive chains of older volcanoes seen extending out from some such hot spots , such as the Hawaiian -- Emperor seamount chain .
