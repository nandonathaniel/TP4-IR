Polar bears are believed to travel rarely beyond about 82 ° North owing to the scarcity of food , though tracks have been seen in the vicinity of the North Pole , and a 2006 expedition reported sighting a polar bear just 1 mi ( 1.6 km ) from the Pole . The ringed seal has also been seen at the Pole , and Arctic foxes have been observed less than 60 km ( 37 mi ) away at 89 ° 40 ′ N .
