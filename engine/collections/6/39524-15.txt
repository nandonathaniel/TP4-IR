MacFarlane conceived the idea for Family Guy in 1995 , while studying animation at the Rhode Island School of Design ( RISD ) . There , he created his thesis film The Life of Larry , which his professor at RISD later submitted to Hanna - Barbera ; this led to MacFarlane being hired by the company . Executives at Fox saw the Larry shorts and contracted MacFarlane to create a series based on the characters entitled Family Guy . While working on the series , Larry and his dog Steve slowly evolved into Peter and Brian ; the rest of the series characters were added later .
