Massive stars emit copious quantities of radiation which pushes against infalling material . In the past , it was thought that this radiation pressure might be substantial enough to halt accretion onto the massive protostar and prevent the formation of stars with masses more than a few tens of solar masses . Recent theoretical work has shown that the production of a jet and outflow clears a cavity through which much of the radiation from a massive protostar can escape without hindering accretion through the disk and onto the protostar . Present thinking is that massive stars may therefore be able to form by a mechanism similar to that by which low mass stars form .
