Animals living in contaminated areas in and around Chernobyl have suffered from a variety of side effects caused by radiation . Oxidative stress and low levels of antioxidants have had severe consequences on the development of the nervous system , including reduced brain size and impaired cognitive abilities . It has been found that birds living in areas with high levels of radiation have statistically significantly smaller brains , which has shown to be a deficit to viability in the wild . Barn swallows ( Hirundo rustica ) that live in or around Chernobyl have displayed an increased rate of physical abnormalities compared to swallows from uncontaminated areas . Abnormalities included partially albinistic plumage , deformed toes , tumors , deformed tail feathers , deformed beaks , and deformed air sacks . Birds with these abnormalities have a reduced viability in the wild and a decrease in fitness . Moeller et al. claimed in 2007 that these effects were likely due to radiation exposure and elevated teratogenic effects of radioactive isotopes in the environment although these conclusions have been challenged . Various birds in the area appear to have adapted to lower levels of radiation by producing more antioxidants , such as glutathione , to help mitigate the oxidative stress .
