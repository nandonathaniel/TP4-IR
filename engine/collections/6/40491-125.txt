Talking is the next milestone of which parents are typically aware . A toddler 's first word most often occurs around 12 months , but again this is only an average . The child will then continue to steadily add to his or her vocabulary until around the age of 18 months when language increases rapidly . He or she may learn as many as 7 -- 9 new words a day . Around this time , toddlers generally know about 50 words . At 21 months is when toddlers begin to incorporate two word phrases into their vocabulary , such as `` I go '' , `` mama give '' , and `` baby play '' . Before going to sleep they often engage in a monologue called crib talk in which they practice conversational skills . At this age , children are becoming very proficient at conveying their wants and needs to their parents in a verbal fashion .
