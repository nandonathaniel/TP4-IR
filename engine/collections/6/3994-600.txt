Almudena ( from the Virgin of Almudena , patroness of Madrid , Spain ) and Fátima ( derived from Our Lady of Fátima ) are common Spanish names rooted in the country  ́ s Roman Catholic tradition , but both of which share Arabic etymologies originating in place names of religious significance . Guadalupe , a name present throughout the Spanish - speaking world , but particularly in Mexico , also shares this feature .
