The academic term for senior high school ( grades 11 and 12 ) operates on a semestral basis . Semestral , Christmas , and summer breaks are scheduled at about the same time as primary and junior high school . Grade 12 pupils have a shorter second semester than grade 11 in order for the school to prepare for graduation .
