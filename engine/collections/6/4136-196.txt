In 1906 , the Liberal party , led by Sir Henry Campbell - Bannerman , won an overwhelming victory on a platform that promised social reforms for the working class . With 379 seats compared to the Conservatives ' 132 , the Liberals could confidently expect to pass their legislative programme through the Commons . At the same time , however , the Conservative Party had a huge majority in the Lords ; it could easily veto any legislation passed by the Commons that was against their interests .
