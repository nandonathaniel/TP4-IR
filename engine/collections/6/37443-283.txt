During the preparation stages of the ENP , Russia insisted on the creation of the four EU - Russia Common Spaces instead of ENP participation , as it saw the ENP as `` unequal '' arrangement with a dominant role of the EU . In the framework of the EU - Russia Common Spaces in May 2005 , a roadmap was adopted with similar content to the ENP Action Plans . Both the ENP and the EU - Russia Common Spaces are implemented by the EU through the European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument .
