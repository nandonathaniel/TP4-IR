Single - payer healthcare is a healthcare system financed by taxes that covers the costs of essential healthcare for all residents , with costs covered by a single public system ( hence ' single - payer ' ) . Alternatively , a multi-payer system is one in which private individuals or their employers obtain health coverage from multiple private or public sources .
