Monkeys Able and Baker became the first monkeys to survive spaceflight after their 1959 flight . On 28 May 1959 , aboard Jupiter IRBM AM - 18 , were a 7 - pound ( 3.18 kg ) American - born rhesus monkey , Able , from Independence , Kansas , and an 11 - ounce ( 310 - gram ) squirrel monkey from Peru , Baker . The monkeys rode in the nose cone of the missile to an altitude of 360 miles ( 579 km ) and a distance of 1,700 miles ( 2,735 km ) down the Atlantic Missile Range from Cape Canaveral , Florida . They withstood forces 38 times the normal pull of gravity and were weightless for about 9 minutes . A top speed of 10,000 mph ( 16,000 km / h ) was reached during their 16 - minute flight . The monkeys survived the flight in good condition . Able died four days after the flight from a reaction to anesthesia , while undergoing surgery to remove an infected medical electrode . Baker was the center of media attention for the next several months as she was watched closely for any ill - effects from her space flight . She was even mated in an attempt to test her reproductive system . Baker lived until 29 November 1984 , at the US Space and Rocket Center in Huntsville , Alabama .
