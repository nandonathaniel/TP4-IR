It has been suggested that many viral capsid proteins have evolved on multiple occasions from functionally diverse cellular proteins . The recruitment of cellular proteins appears to have occurred at different stages of evolution , so that some cellular proteins were captured and refunctionalized prior to the divergence of cellular organisms into the three contemporary domains of life , whereas others were hijacked relatively recently . As a result , some capsid proteins are widespread in viruses infecting distantly related organisms ( e.g. , capsid proteins with the jelly - roll fold ) , whereas others are restricted to a particular group of viruses ( e.g. , capsid proteins of alphaviruses ) .
