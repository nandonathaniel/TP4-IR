On December 8 , 2009 , sponsored by nonprofit CityArchRiver2015 , the international design competition `` Framing a Modern Masterpiece : The City + The Arch + The River 2015 '' commenced . It aimed to `` design a plan to improve the riverfront park landscape , ease access for pedestrians across Memorial Drive and expand onto the East St. Louis riverfront , '' as well as to lure visitors . The contest consisted of three stages -- portfolio assessment ( narrowed down to 8 -- 10 teams ) , team interviews ( narrowed down to 4 -- 5 teams ) , and review of design proposals . The competition received 49 applicants , which were narrowed down to five in the first two stages . On August 17 , 2010 , the designs of the five finalists were revealed to the public and exhibited at the theater below the arch . On August 26 , the finalists made their cases to an eight - member jury , and on September 21 , the winner was revealed -- Michael Van Valkenburgh Associates . The initiative 's plans include updating Kiener Plaza and the Old Courthouse , connecting the city to the Arch grounds with a park over Interstate 70 , a re-imagined museum and improved accessibility . The budget for the project is $380 million and is set to be completed in 2018 .
