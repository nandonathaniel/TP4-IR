William assembled a large invasion fleet and an army gathered from Normandy and the rest of France , including large contingents from Brittany and Flanders . He spent almost nine months on his preparations , as he had to construct a fleet from nothing . According to some Norman chronicles , he also secured diplomatic support , although the accuracy of the reports has been a matter of historical debate . The most famous claim is that Pope Alexander II gave a papal banner as a token of support , which only appears in William of Poitiers 's account , and not in more contemporary narratives . In April 1066 Halley 's Comet appeared in the sky , and was widely reported throughout Europe . Contemporary accounts connected the comet 's appearance with the succession crisis in England .
