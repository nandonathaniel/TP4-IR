Merv Griffin conceived Wheel of Fortune just as the original version of Jeopardy ! , another show he had created , was ending its 11 - year run on NBC with Art Fleming as its host . Griffin decided to create a Hangman - style game after recalling long car trips as a child , on which he and his sister played Hangman . After he discussed the idea with Merv Griffin Enterprises ' staff , they thought that the idea would work as a game show if it had a `` hook '' . He decided to add a roulette - style wheel because he was always `` drawn to '' such wheels when he saw them in casinos . He and MGE 's then - president Murray Schwartz consulted an executive of Caesars Palace to find out how to build such a wheel .
