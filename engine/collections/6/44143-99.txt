When launched the car proposed several problems . The first of the problems with the coupe is engine access which because the car is a mid rear arrangement proposed several problems and made the car hard to work on , it is reported that the subframe had to be removed in order to work on the engine . The second problem is the KV6 powerplant which had to have a bespoke smaller fuel tank to fit in the engine bay as the standard fuel tank would n't fit . Although disputed as to whether the car received the KV6 powerplant in the first place it now seems likely however , as ex-MG engineer Chris Flanagan produced his own 2.5 KV6 MGF in 2004 and has subsequently produced further KV6 engined TFs at Retro Sports Cars Ltd in Yorkshire .
