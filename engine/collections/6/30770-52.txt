Strikes organized by labor unions became routine events by the 1880s . There were 37,000 strikes , 1881 to 1905 . By far the largest number were in the building trades , followed far behind by coal miners . The main goal was control of working conditions , setting uniform wage scales , protesting the firing of a member , and settling which rival union was in control . Most strikes were of very short duration . In times of depression strikes were more violent but less successful , because the company was losing money anyway . They were successful in times of prosperity when the company was losing profits and wanted to settle quickly .
