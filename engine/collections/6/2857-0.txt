In countries influenced by the British political system , a whip is an official of a political party whose task is to ensure party discipline in a legislature . Whips are the party 's `` enforcers '' ; they invite their fellow legislators to attend voting sessions and to vote according to the official party policy . The term is taken from the `` whipper - in '' during a hunt , who tries to prevent the hounds from wandering away from the pack .
