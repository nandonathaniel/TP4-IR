The British conquered New France by 1760 with the fall of Quebec . France formally ceded New France to the British in the Treaty of Paris of 1763 . The same year , King George III issued the Royal Proclamation of 1763 , which established the western and northern boundary of the Province of New York at the limits of the Hudson , Mohawk and Delaware River watersheds . The area between that boundary and the Great Lakes and Saint Lawrence River , including west of the Appalachian Mountains , was to be the `` Indian Reserve . ''
