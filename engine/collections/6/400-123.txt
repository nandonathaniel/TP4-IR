The Imperial anthem of Germany , Heil dir im Siegerkranz ( originally the royal anthem of Prussia since 1795 ) , used the melody of `` God Save the King '' . In addition , several German states used the tune , including Bavaria ( Heil unserm KÃ¶nig , Heil ! - Hail to our King , Hail ! ) , Saxony ( Gott segne Sachsenland - God bless Saxony ) and Liechtenstein , which did not join the German Empire ( see below ) . During the reign of Otto of Greece , the Bavarian royal anthem also served as the Greek anthem .
