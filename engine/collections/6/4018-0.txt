In the United States , a 401 ( k ) plan is the tax - qualified , defined - contribution pension account defined in subsection 401 ( k ) of the Internal Revenue Code . Under the plan , retirement savings contributions are provided ( and sometimes proportionately matched ) by an employer , deducted from the employee 's paycheck before taxation ( therefore tax - deferred until withdrawn after retirement or as otherwise permitted by applicable law ) , and limited to a maximum pre-tax annual contribution of $18,500 ( as of 2018 ) .
