Anatomy ( Greek anatomÄ“ , `` dissection '' ) is the branch of biology concerned with the study of the structure of organisms and their parts . Anatomy is a branch of natural science dealing with the structural organization of living things . It is an old science , having its beginnings in prehistoric times . Anatomy is inherently tied to embryology , comparative anatomy , evolutionary biology , and phylogeny , as these are the processes by which anatomy is generated over immediate ( embryology ) and long ( evolution ) timescales . Human anatomy is one of the basic essential sciences of medicine . Anatomy and physiology , which study ( respectively ) the structure and function of organisms and their parts , make a natural pair of related disciplines , and they are often studied together .
