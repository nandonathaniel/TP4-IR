Historically , computer language syntax was restricted to the ASCII character set ; in the absence of the Ã— character , U + 002A * Asterisk became the de facto standard notation of the multiplication operator in computing . This selection is still reflected in the standard numeric keypad , where the arithmetic operations of addition , subtraction , multiplication , and division are represented by the + , - , * , and / keys , respectively .
