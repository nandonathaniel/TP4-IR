In 2010 , the Federal Bureau of Investigation encouraged agents to use a broad interpretation of public safety - related questions in terrorism cases , stating that the `` magnitude and complexity '' of terrorist threats justified `` a significantly more extensive public safety interrogation without Miranda warnings than would be permissible in an ordinary criminal case '' , continuing to list such examples as : `` questions about possible impending or coordinated terrorist attacks ; the location , nature and threat posed by weapons that might pose an imminent danger to the public ; and the identities , locations , and activities or intentions of accomplices who may be plotting additional imminent attacks '' . A Department of Justice spokesman described this position as not altering the constitutional right , but as clarifying existing flexibility in the rule .
