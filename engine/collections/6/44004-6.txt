The middle rowers of a crew ( numbers 2 and 3 in a four , and 3 , 4 , 5 and 6 in an eight ) are normally the most powerful and heaviest rowers , colloquially known as the Fuel Tank , Engine Room , Power House or Meat Wagon . The boat pitches and yaws less in the middle , and the rowers there have less effect on these movements , being closer to the centre of mass and centre of buoyancy . Therefore , the rowers in the middle of the boat do not have to be as technically sound or reactive to the movements of the boat , and can focus more on pulling as hard as they can . It is common practice among crews to put the most technically proficient rowers at the bow and stern and the physically strongest and heaviest rowers in the centre .
