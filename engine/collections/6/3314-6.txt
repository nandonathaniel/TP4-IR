Although the official Christmas tree tradition at Rockefeller Center began in 1933 ( the year 30 Rockefeller Plaza opened ) , an unofficial tradition began during the Depression - era construction of the Center , when workers decorated a smaller 20 foot ( 6.1 m ) balsam fir with `` strings of cranberries , garlands of paper , and even a few tin cans '' on Christmas Eve ( December 24 , 1931 ) , as recounted by Daniel Okrent in his history of Rockefeller Center . According to Rockefeller Center , workers pooled their money for that unlit tree , with the garlands made by workers ' families .
