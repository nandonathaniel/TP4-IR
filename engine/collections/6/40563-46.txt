From the academic world , positive reviews came from Michael Campbell , author of Popular Music in America : And the Beat Goes On , who felt that the soothing melody of the track resembles British singer Steve Winwood 's 1986 single `` Higher Love '' . The author noted the song for merging disparate and contradictory musical features in it . He found that the simple melody of `` Like a Prayer '' offered an easy listen , but the contrasts in sound , rhythm and texture appealed to different target audiences . Australian rock music journalist Toby Creswell wrote in his book 1001 Songs that `` ' Like a Prayer ' is a beautifully crafted devotional song in the guise of perfect pop . God is the drum machine here . '' Scholar Georges Claude Guilbert , author of Madonna as Postmodern Myth : How One Star 's Self - Construction Rewrites Sex , Gender , Hollywood and the American Dream , noted that there is a polysemy in `` Like a Prayer '' since the singer addresses either God or her lover , and in doing so `` Madonna achieves the gold - card of attaining her own divinity . Whenever someone calls her name , it alludes to the song '' . Theologian Andrew Greeley compared `` Like a Prayer '' with the biblical Song of Songs . Greeley , although focusing more on the video , acknowledged the fact that sexual passion may be revelatory , and complimented Madonna for glorifying ideologies of female subjectivity and womanhood in the song .
