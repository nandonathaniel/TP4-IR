Archeological evidence for early dance includes 9,000 - year - old paintings in India at the Rock Shelters of Bhimbetka , and Egyptian tomb paintings depicting dancing figures , dated c. 3300 BC . It has been proposed that before the invention of written languages , dance was an important part of the oral and performance methods of passing stories down from generation to generation . The use of dance in ecstatic trance states and healing rituals ( as observed today in many contemporary `` primitive '' cultures , from the Brazilian rainforest to the Kalahari Desert ) is thought to have been another early factor in the social development of dance .
