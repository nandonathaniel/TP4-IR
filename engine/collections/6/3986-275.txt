One of the early guided summiters , Richard Bass ( of Seven Summits fame ) responded in an interview about Everest climbers and what it took to survive there , `` Climbers should have high altitude experience before they attempt the really big mountains . People do n't realise the difference between a 20,000 - foot mountain and 29,000 feet . It 's not just arithmetic . The reduction of oxygen in the air is proportionate to the altitude alright , but the effect on the human body is disproportionate -- an exponential curve . People climb Denali ( 20,320 feet ) or Aconcagua ( 22,834 feet ) and think , ' Heck , I feel great up here , I 'm going to try Everest . ' But it 's not like that . ''
