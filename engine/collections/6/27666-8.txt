Although they did not fix their schedules to the clock in the modern sense , ancient civilizations adjusted daily schedules to the sun more flexibly than DST does , often dividing daylight into twelve hours regardless of daytime , so that each daylight hour was longer during summer . For example , the Romans kept time with water clocks that had different scales for different months of the year : at Rome 's latitude the third hour from sunrise , hora tertia , started by modern standards at 09 : 02 solar time and lasted 44 minutes at the winter solstice , but at the summer solstice it started at 06 : 58 and lasted 75 minutes . After ancient times , equal - length civil hours eventually supplanted unequal , so civil time no longer varies by season . Unequal hours are still used in a few traditional settings , such as some monasteries of Mount Athos and all Jewish ceremonies .
