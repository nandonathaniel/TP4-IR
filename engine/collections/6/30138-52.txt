Mohammad Reza 's marriage to Fawzia produced one child , a daughter , Princess Shahnaz Pahlavi ( born 27 October 1940 ) . Their marriage was not a happy one as the Crown Prince was openly unfaithful , often being seen driving around Tehran in one of his expensive cars with one of his girlfriends . Mohammad Reza 's dominating and extremely possessive mother saw her daughter - in - law as a rival to her son 's love , and took to humiliating Princess Fawzia , whose husband sided with his mother . A quiet , shy woman , Fawzia described her marriage as miserable , feeling very much unwanted and unloved by the Pahlavi family and longing to go back to Egypt . In his 1961 book Mission For My Country , Mohammad Reza wrote the `` only happy light moment '' of his entire marriage to Fawzia was the birth of his daughter .
