During sporadic excavations at Boğazköy ( Hattusa ) that began in 1906 , the archaeologist Hugo Winckler found a royal archive with 10,000 tablets , inscribed in cuneiform Akkadian and the same unknown language as the Egyptian letters from Kheta -- thus confirming the identity of the two names . He also proved that the ruins at Boğazköy were the remains of the capital of an empire that , at one point , controlled northern Syria .
