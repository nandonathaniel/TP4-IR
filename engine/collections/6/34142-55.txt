The new scale takes into account quality of construction and standardizes different kinds of structures . The wind speeds on the original scale were deemed by meteorologists and engineers as being too high , and engineering studies indicated that slower winds than initially estimated cause the respective degrees of damage . The old scale lists an F5 tornado as wind speeds of 261 -- 318 mph ( 420 -- 512 km / h ) , while the new scale lists an EF5 as a tornado with winds above 200 mph ( 322 km / h ) , found to be sufficient to cause the damage previously ascribed to the F5 range of wind speeds . None of the tornadoes recorded on or before January 31 , 2007 , will be re-categorized .
