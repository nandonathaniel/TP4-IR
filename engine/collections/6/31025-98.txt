Historically , one of the first tie - breaking procedures was contained in the Sheffield Rules between 1862 and 1871 , with the concept of the rouge , scorable when the ball went narrowly wide off the goal . Rule 14 stated `` A goal outweighs any number of rouges . Should no goals or an equal number be obtained , the match is decided by rouges '' . Similarly , the try in rugby football was used from 1875 as a tie - breaker if teams were level on goals .
