According to Hanford Dixon , then a cornerback with the Browns , Dixon himself gave his defensive teammates the name `` Dawgs '' to inspire them before the 1985 season . The Dawg Pound started during the 1985 training camp at Lakeland Community College in Kirtland , Ohio . Dixon and fellow cornerback Frank Minnifield started the idea of the pound by using the dog - versus - cat relationship between the quarterback and the defense . `` We had the idea of the quarterback being the cat , and the defensive line being the dog , '' Dixon said . `` Whenever the defense would get a regular sack or a coverage sack the defensive linemen and linebackers would bark . '' This attitude carried into the stands at the training camp , where fans started barking along with the players . Dixon and Minnifield then put up the first `` Dawg Pound '' banner in front of the bleachers before the first preseason game at old Cleveland Stadium . The bleacher section had the cheapest seats in the stadium , and its fans were already known as the most vocal . They adopted their new identity whole - heartedly , wearing dog noses , dog masks , bone - shaped hats and other outlandish costumes .
