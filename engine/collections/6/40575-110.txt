A report by the secretariat of the UN Economic Commission for Africa ( ECA ) quotes : `` one of the strongest appeals of polygyny to men in Africa is precisely its economic aspect , for a man with several wives commands more land , can produce more food for his household and can achieve a high status due to the wealth which he can command . '' . According to Esther Boserup , over much of the continent of Africa , tribal rules of land tenure are still in force . This implies that members of a tribe , which commands a certain territory , have a native right to take land under cultivation for food production and in many cases also for the cultivation of cash crops . Under this tenure system , an additional wife is an economic asset that helps the family to expand its production .
