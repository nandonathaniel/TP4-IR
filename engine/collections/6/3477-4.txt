Canadian law requires that all persons entering Canada must carry proof of both citizenship and identity . A valid U.S. passport or passport card is preferred , although a birth certificate , naturalization certificate , citizenship certificate , or another document proving U.S. nationality , together with a government - issued photo ID ( such as a driver 's license ) are acceptable to establish identity and nationality . However , the documents required to return to the United States can be more restrictive ( for example , a birth certificate and photo ID are insufficient ) -- see the section below on Return entry into the U.S.
