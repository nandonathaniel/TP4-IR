Worried only about getting his $500 check , Conor shows up at the baseball field to a rag tag bunch of trash - talking , street-wise , inner city kids who live in the projects , where people have to sit on the floor in their apartments to avoid stray bullets . Conor 's efforts are hindered from the onset by the fact that he does not have nine kids to make up the team -- one kid , having altered his birth certificate to be younger and another , `` G - Baby '' ( DeWayne Warren ) , who is far too young to play . The kids tell Conor it is because their teacher , Elizabeth `` Sister '' Wilkes ( Diane Lane ) , is making several boys finish a book report . Conor visits the teacher , but his life is threatened repeatedly by his bookies for not paying his gambling debts . He is visited by the mother of three boys that are allowed to play in exchange for his tutoring them .
