Chlamydia can be spread during vaginal , anal , or oral sex , and can be passed from an infected mother to her baby during childbirth . The eye infections may also be spread by personal contact , flies , and contaminated towels in areas with poor sanitation . Chlamydia trachomatis only occurs in humans . Diagnosis is often by screening which is recommended yearly in sexually active women under the age of twenty five , others at higher risk , and at the first prenatal visit . Testing can be done on the urine or a swab of the cervix , vagina , or urethra . Rectal or mouth swabs are required to diagnose infections in those areas .
