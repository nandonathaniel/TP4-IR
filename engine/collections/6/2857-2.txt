The expression whip in its parliamentary context has its origins in hunting terminology . The Oxford English Dictionary defines the term whipper - in as , `` a huntsman 's assistant who keeps the hounds from straying by driving them back with the whip into the main body of the pack '' . According to that dictionary , the first recorded use of the term whipper - in in the parliamentary sense occurs in 1772 . However , P.D.G. Thomas in House of Commons in the Eighteenth Century cites two examples of the use of the term that pre-date 1772 .
