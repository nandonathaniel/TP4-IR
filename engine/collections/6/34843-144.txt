Japan was the leader of the Axis powers in the Pacific Theatre . Some people consider that World War II actually began with the invasion of China by Japan in 1937 . The war ended with the capitulation of Japan after the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki by the US . Although the US saw most action in the Pacific Theatre , the United Kingdom also had a role in Japan 's defeat , particularly in the Burma campaign . The USSR did not declare war on Japan until 9 August 1945 when it invaded Manchuria .
