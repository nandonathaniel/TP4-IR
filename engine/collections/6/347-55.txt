All the directors have been supportive of each other . Chris Columbus praised the character development in the films , while Alfonso Cuar√≥n admired the `` quiet poetry '' of David Yates ' films . Mike Newell noted that each director had a different heroism , and David Yates views the first four films `` respectfully and enjoy ( s ) them . '' Daniel Radcliffe said Yates `` took the charm of the films that Chris made and the visual flair of everything that Alfonso did and the thoroughly British , bombastic nature of the film directed by Mike Newell '' and added `` his own sense '' of realism .
