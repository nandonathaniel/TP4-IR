Chopper drive circuits are referred to as constant current drives because they generate a somewhat constant current in each winding rather than applying a constant voltage . On each new step , a very high voltage is applied to the winding initially . This causes the current in the winding to rise quickly since dI / dt = V / L where V is very large . The current in each winding is monitored by the controller , usually by measuring the voltage across a small sense resistor in series with each winding . When the current exceeds a specified current limit , the voltage is turned off or `` chopped '' , typically using power transistors . When the winding current drops below the specified limit , the voltage is turned on again . In this way , the current is held relatively constant for a particular step position . This requires additional electronics to sense winding currents , and control the switching , but it allows stepper motors to be driven with higher torque at higher speeds than L / R drives . Integrated electronics for this purpose are widely available .
