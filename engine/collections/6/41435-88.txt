Costume designer Lindy Hemming explained that Bane uses a mask to inhale an analgesic gas , which , in director Christopher Nolan 's words , `` keeps his pain just below the threshold so he can function . '' In designing Bane 's costume , Hemming needed it to look `` like an amalgam of all sorts of bits and pieces he cobbled together , as he passed through some very remote places . We made parts of his vest , for example , from fragments of an old military tent . His clothes are militaristic , but are not in any way a uniform . '' Hemming also designed Bane 's mask to look `` animalistic '' . Costume effects supervisor Graham Churchyard created a three - dimensional model of actor Tom Hardy 's face and skull to design the mask , allowing the mask to perfectly conform to the contours of Hardy 's face . Hemming personally designed Bane 's coat , which she admitted took two years to complete . Taking inspiration from a Swedish army jacket and a frock coat from the French Revolution , it was designed to make Bane look equal parts dictatorial and revolutionary . The design was difficult as Hemming struggled to find a tailor in Los Angeles who could work with shearling .
