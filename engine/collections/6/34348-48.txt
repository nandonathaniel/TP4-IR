The first of the Diadochi wars broke out when Perdiccas planned to marry Alexander 's sister Cleopatra and began to question Antigonus I Monophthalmus ' leadership in Asia Minor . Antigonus fled for Greece , and then , together with Antipater and Craterus ( the satrap of Cilicia who had been in Greece fighting the Lamian war ) invaded Anatolia . The rebels were supported by Lysimachus , the satrap of Thrace and Ptolemy , the satrap of Egypt . Although Eumenes , satrap of Cappadocia , defeated the rebels in Asia Minor , Perdiccas himself was murdered by his own generals Peithon , Seleucus , and Antigenes ( possibly with Ptolemy 's aid ) during his invasion of Egypt ( c. 21 May to 19 June , 320 BC ) . Ptolemy came to terms with Perdiccas 's murderers , making Peithon and Arrhidaeus regents in his place , but soon these came to a new agreement with Antipater at the Treaty of Triparadisus . Antipater was made regent of the Empire , and the two kings were moved to Macedon . Antigonus remained in charge of Asia Minor , Ptolemy retained Egypt , Lysimachus retained Thrace and Seleucus I controlled Babylon .
