In times where there is a majority government , the House of Commons ' scrutiny of the government is weak . Since elections use the first - past - the - post electoral system , the governing party tends to enjoy a large majority in the Commons ; there is often limited need to compromise with other parties . ( Minority governments , however , are not uncommon . ) Modern Canadian political parties are so tightly organized that they leave relatively little room for free action by their MPs . In many cases , MPs may be expelled from their parties for voting against the instructions of party leaders . As well , the major parties require candidates ' nominations to be signed by party leaders , thus giving the leaders the power to , effectively , end a politician 's career . Thus , defeats of majority governments on issues of confidence are very rare . Paul Martin 's Liberal minority government lost a vote of no confidence in 2005 ; the last time this had occurred was in 1979 , when Joe Clark 's Progressive Conservative minority government was defeated after a term of just six months .
