In 2007 and 2008 , Dormer played Anne Boleyn in the first two seasons of The Tudors , for which she received highly positive reviews . Robert Abele of LA Weekly wrote : `` Natalie Dormer presents a painterly exquisiteness and complexity in her portrayal of Anne Boleyn ... her enigmatic , time - halting loveliness is a boon for The Tudors , and damn near worth losing your head over '' . After her character 's death at the end of the second season , The Boston Herald noted : `` Dormer gave Anne Boleyn life , making her not just a beautiful schemer but a rebellious , defiantly independent tragic hero in the tradition of Rebel Without a Cause and Cool Hand Luke ... her departure from The Tudors leaves a tremendous void .
