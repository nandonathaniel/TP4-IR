The history of the United States began with the settlement of Indigenous people before 10,000 BC . Numerous cultures formed . The arrival of Christopher Columbus in 1492 started the European colonization of the Americas . Most colonies formed after 1600 . The Spanish built small settlements in Florida and the Southwest , and the French along the Mississippi River and the Gulf Coast . By the 1770s , thirteen British colonies contained 2.5 million people along the Atlantic coast east of the Appalachian Mountains . After the end of the French and Indian Wars in the 1760s , the British government imposed a series of new taxes , rejecting the colonists ' argument that new taxes needed their approval ( see Stamp Act 1765 ) . Tax resistance , especially the Boston Tea Party ( 1773 ) , led to punitive laws by Parliament designed to end self - government in Massachusetts .
