For one - dimensional arrays , this facility may be provided as an operation `` append ( A , x ) '' that increases the size of the array A by one and then sets the value of the last element to x . Other array types ( such as Pascal strings ) provide a concatenation operator , which can be used together with slicing to achieve that effect and more . In some languages , assigning a value to an element of an array automatically extends the array , if necessary , to include that element . In other array types , a slice can be replaced by an array of different size '' with subsequent elements being renumbered accordingly -- as in Python 's list assignment `` A ( 5 : 5 ) = ( 10 , 20 , 30 ) '' , that inserts three new elements ( 10 , 20 , and 30 ) before element `` A ( 5 ) '' . Resizable arrays are conceptually similar to lists , and the two concepts are synonymous in some languages .
