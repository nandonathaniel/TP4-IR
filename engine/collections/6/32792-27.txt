Some of the first human complex societies originated in river valleys , such as that of the Nile , Tigris - Euphrates , Indus , Ganges , Yangtze , Yellow River , Mississippi , and arguably Amazon . In prehistory , the rivers were used as a source of fresh water and food ( fish and game ) , as well as a place to wash and a sewer . The proximity of water moderated temperature extremes and provided a source for irrigation , stimulating the development of agriculture . Most of the first civilizations developed from these river valley communities .
