Dodger Stadium offered several innovative design features . One of these was a covered and screened section of dugout - level seats behind home plate . Dodger owner Walter O'Malley was inspired to incorporate this feature into the Dodger Stadium design after having seen it at Tokyo 's Korakuen Stadium during the Brooklyn Dodgers ' postseason goodwill tour of Japan in 1956 . The original dugout seating area was replaced by more conventional box seating in a 1999 renovation , but this feature has been replicated at Progressive Field in Cleveland and Angel Stadium of Anaheim .
