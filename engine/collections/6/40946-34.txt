Before February 1954 , no endeavor to get the pledge officially amended had succeeded . The final successful push came from George MacPherson Docherty . Some American presidents honored Lincoln 's birthday by attending services at the church Lincoln attended , New York Avenue Presbyterian Church by sitting in Lincoln 's pew on the Sunday nearest February 12 . On February 7 , 1954 , with President Eisenhower sitting in Lincoln 's pew , the church 's pastor , George MacPherson Docherty , delivered a sermon based on the Gettysburg Address entitled `` A New Birth of Freedom . '' He argued that the nation 's might lay not in arms but rather in its spirit and higher purpose . He noted that the Pledge 's sentiments could be those of any nation : `` There was something missing in the pledge , and that which was missing was the characteristic and definitive factor in the American way of life . '' He cited Lincoln 's words `` under God '' as defining words that set the US apart from other nations .
