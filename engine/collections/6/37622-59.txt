Paul finally became sheriff in April 1881 , but it was too late to reappoint Wyatt Earp as deputy sheriff because on January 1 , 1881 , the eastern portion of Pima County containing Tombstone had been split off into the new Cochise County , which would need its own sheriff , based in the county 's largest city , Tombstone . This position was filled by a political appointment from the governor , and Wyatt and Behan both wanted the job . The Cochise County sheriff 's position was worth more than $40,000 a year ( about $1,014,345 today ) because the office holder was also county assessor and tax collector , and the board of supervisors allowed him to keep ten percent of the amounts paid .
