The National Football League Draft , also called the Player Selection Meeting , is an annual event in which it serves as the league 's most common source of player recruitment . The basic design of the draft is that each team is given a position in the drafting order in reverse order relative to its record in the previous year , which means that the last place team is positioned first . From this position , the team can either select a player or trade their position to another team for other draft positions , a player or players , or any combination thereof . The round is complete when each team has either selected a player or traded its draft position . Certain aspects of the draft , including team positioning and the number of rounds in the draft , have seen revisions since its first creation in 1936 , but the fundamental methodology has remained the same . Currently the draft consists of seven rounds . The original rationale in creating the draft was to increase the competitive parity between the teams as the worst team would , ideally , have chosen the best player available .
