Since 2002 , Detroit 's Ford Field had played host to the Motor City Bowl -- later known as the Little Caesars Pizza Bowl for sponsorship reasons ; a bowl game between the 8th placed team in the Big Ten Conference and the champion of the Mid-American Conference ( MAC ) which was first played in 1997 at the Pontiac Silverdome . In May 2013 , ESPN reported that the Detroit Lions were planning to organize a new Big Ten bowl game at Ford Field against an Atlantic Coast Conference ( ACC ) opponent -- Big Ten commissioner Jim Delany had expressed a desire to revamp the conference 's lineup of bowl games for the 2014 season to keep them `` fresh '' . In August 2013 , the Lions officially confirmed the new , then - unnamed game , tentatively scheduled for December 30 , 2014 . The team had reached six - year deals with the Big Ten and ACC to provide tie - ins for the game ; the teams playing in the bowl are to be picked by representatives from each participating conference .
