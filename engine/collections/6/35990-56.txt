The term `` Donuts '' was already trademarked by one of the largest Spanish bakery firms , Panrico , so the company was born as a joint venture between Dunkin ' Donuts ' then - parent Allied Domecq and Panrico ( only Spanish shareholders , representing 50 % ) in order to use the brand name `` Dunkin ' Donuts '' . In 2007 , after Dunkin ' Donuts bought out Panrico 's 50 % share , the stores were rebranded to `` Dunkin ' Coffee '' . As of 2017 , there are 59 Dunkin ' Coffee locations in Spain , the majority of which are in Barcelona , Madrid , and MÃ¡laga . Their slogan , `` Juntos es mejor '' , translates to `` Together is better '' .
