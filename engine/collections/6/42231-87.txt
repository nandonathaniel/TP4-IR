The bulk of the German territories in the left ( West ) bank was awarded to Prussia despite the distance from the Prussian centre and the difference in cultures . A new state was created : the Grand - Duchy of Luxembourg , of which the citadel served as an outpost of the Prussian army . France lost several strongholds covering her frontiers : Bouillon ( Ardennes NE of Sedan ) , Saarlouis ( Saarland NW of Saarbr√ºcken ) , Landau ( Rhineland NW of Karlsruhe ) and so on .
