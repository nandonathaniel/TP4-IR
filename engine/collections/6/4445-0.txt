A piñata ( / pɪnˈjɑːtə / , US pronunciation / pɪnˈjɑːdɑː / , Spanish pronunciation : ( piˈɲata ) ( listen ) ) is a container often made of papier - mâché , pottery , or cloth ; it is decorated , and filled with small toys or candy , or both , and then broken as part of a ceremony or celebration . Piñatas are commonly associated with Mexico . The idea of breaking a container filled with treats came to Europe in the 14th century , where the name , from the Italian pignatta , was introduced . The Spanish brought the European tradition to Mexico , although there were similar traditions in Mesoamerica , such as the Aztecs ' honoring the birthday of the god Huitzilopochtli in mid December . According to local records , the Mexican piñata tradition began in the town of Acolman , just north of Mexico City , where piñatas were introduced for catechism purposes as well as to co-opt the Huitzilopochtli ceremony . Today , the piñata is still part of Mexican culture , the cultures of other countries in Latin America , as well as the United States , but it has mostly lost its religious character .
