Tournaments are oriented graphs obtained by choosing a direction for each edge in undirected complete graphs . Directed acyclic graphs ( DAGs ) are directed graphs with no directed cycles . Multitrees are DAGs in which no two directed paths from a single starting vertex meet back at the same ending vertex . Oriented trees or polytrees are DAGs formed by orienting the edges of undirected acyclic graphs . Rooted trees are oriented trees in which all edges of the underlying undirected tree are directed either away from or towards the root .
