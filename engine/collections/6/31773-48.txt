Stan Lee appears as an informant to the Watchers , discussing previous adventures that include Lee 's cameos in other MCU films ; he specifically mentions his time as a FedEx delivery man , referring to Lee 's cameo in Captain America : Civil War . This acknowledged the fan theory that Lee may be portraying the same character in all his cameos , with Gunn noting that `` people thought Stan Lee is ( Uatu the Watcher ) and that all of these cameos are part of him being a Watcher . So , Stan Lee as a guy who is working for the Watchers was something that I thought was fun for the MCU . '' Feige added that Lee `` clearly exists , you know , above and apart from the reality of all the films . So the notion that he could be sitting there on a cosmic pit stop during the jump gate sequence in Guardians ... really says , so wait a minute , he 's this same character who 's popped up in all these films ? '' Lee filmed several different versions of the scene , including an alternative where he references his role in Deadpool , which would have been the first acknowledgment of the X-Men film series by an MCU film . Gunn later admitted that the Civil War reference is a continuity error , given Vol. 2 is set before the events of Civil War , saying , `` I screwed up ; I was n't thinking . But I 'm going to say that probably Stan Lee used the guise of a Fed Ex guy more than one time . ''
