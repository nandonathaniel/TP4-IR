Tribes in pre-Roman Italy ( including the Etruscans , Umbrians , Ligurians , Sabines , Latins , Campanians , Apulians , Saliscans , and Sabellians ) apparently lived in temporary locations . They cultivated small patches of land , kept sheep and cattle , traded with foreign merchants , and occasionally fought . These Italic groups developed identities as settlers and warriors around 900 BC . They built forts in the mountains which are studied today , as are the ruins of a large Samnite temple and theater at Pietrabbondante .
