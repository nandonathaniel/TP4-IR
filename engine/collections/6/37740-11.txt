Whereas the cantos one to three began with `` O wild West Wind '' and `` Thou '' ( 15 , 29 ) and were clearly directed to the wind , there is a change in the fourth canto . The focus is no more on the `` wind '' , but on the speaker who says `` If I ... '' ( 43 -- 44 ) . Until this part , the poem has appeared very anonymous and was only concentrated on the wind and its forces so that the author of the poem was more or less forgotten . Pirie calls this `` the suppression of personality '' which finally vanishes at that part of the poem . It becomes more and more clear that what the author talks about now is himself . That this must be true , shows the frequency of the author 's use of the first - person pronouns `` I '' ( 43 -- 44 , 48 , 51 , 54 ) , `` my '' ( 48 , 52 ) , and `` me '' ( 53 ) . These pronouns appear nine times in the fourth canto . Certainly the author wants to dramatise the atmosphere so that the reader recalls the situation of canto one to three . He achieves this by using the same pictures of the previous cantos in this one . Whereas these pictures , such as `` leaf '' , `` cloud '' , and `` wave have existed only together with the wind , they are now existing with the author . The author thinks about being one of them and says `` If I were a ... '' ( 43 ff . ) . Shelley here identifies himself with the wind , although he knows that he can not do that , because it is impossible for someone to put all the things he has learned from life aside and enter a `` world of innocence '' . That Shelley is deeply aware of his closedness in life and his identity shows his command in line 53 . There he says `` Oh , lift me up as a wave , a leaf , a cloud '' ( 53 ) . He knows that this is something impossible to achieve , but he does not stop praying for it . The only chance Shelley sees to make his prayer and wish for a new identity with the Wind come true is by pain or death , as death leads to rebirth . So , he wants to `` fall upon the thorns of life '' and `` bleed '' ( 54 ) .
