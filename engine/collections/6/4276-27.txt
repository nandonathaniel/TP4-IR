Pepsin is the main gastric enzyme . It is produced by the stomach cells called `` chief cells '' in its inactive form pepsinogen , which is a zymogen . Pepsinogen is then activated by the stomach acid into its active form , pepsin . Pepsin breaks down the protein in the food into smaller particles , such as peptide fragments and amino acids . Protein digestion , therefore , first starts in the stomach , unlike carbohydrate and lipids , which start their digestion in the mouth .
