The next Himalayan Indian state , Himachal Pradesh , lacks very high mountains , but is noted for its hill stations , particularly Shimla , the summer capital of the British Raj , and Dharmasala , the centre of the Tibetan community in exile in India . This area marks the start of the Punjab Himalaya and the Sutlej river , the most easterly of the five tributaries of the Indus , cuts through the range here . Further west , the Himalayas form most of the southern portion of the disputed Indian State of Jammu & Kashmir . The twin peaks of Nun Kun are the only mountains over 7000 m in this part of the Himalayas . Beyond lies the renown Kashmir Valley and the town and lakes of Srinagar . Finally , the Himalayas cross the Line of Control into Pakistan and reach their western end in the dramatic 8000 m peak of Nanga Parbat , which rises over 7000 m above the Indus valley and is the most westerly of the 8000 m summits .
