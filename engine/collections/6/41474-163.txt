Political opposition to colonial rule often assumed religious dimensions . Independent Christian churches had emerged at the end of the nineteenth century . European interpretations of Christian orthodoxy in some cases refused to allow the incorporation of local customs and practices , although the various mission denominations interpreted Christianity in different ways . Most Europeans tended to overlook their own differences and were surprised and shocked that Nigerians wanted to develop new denominations independent of European control . Protestant sects had flourished in Christianity since the Reformation ; the emergence of independent Christian churches in Nigeria ( as of black denominations in the United States ) was another phase of this history . The pulpits of the independent congregations became avenues for the free expression of critics of colonial rule .
