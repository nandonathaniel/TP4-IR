If the basis of popular government in peacetime is virtue , the basis of popular government during a revolution is both virtue and terror ; virtue , without which terror is baneful ; terror , without which virtue is powerless . Terror is nothing more than speedy , severe and inflexible justice ; it is thus an emanation of virtue ; it is less a principle in itself , than a consequence of the general principle of democracy , applied to the most pressing needs of the patrie ( homeland , fatherland ) .
