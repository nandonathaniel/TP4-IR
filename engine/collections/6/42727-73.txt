The `` Maltese Falcon '' itself is said to have been based on the `` Kniphausen Hawk '' , a ceremonial pouring vessel made in 1697 for George William von Kniphausen , Count of the Holy Roman Empire . It is modeled after a hawk perched on a rock and is encrusted with red garnets , amethysts , emeralds and blue sapphires . The vessel is currently owned by the Cavendish family and is part of the collection at Chatsworth House .
