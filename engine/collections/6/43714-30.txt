In the postwar period , Japan 's golf courses came under the control of the occupying forces . It was not until 1952 that courses started to be returned to Japanese control . By 1956 there were 72 courses and in 1957 Torakichi Nakamura and Koichi Ono won the Canada Cup ( now World Cup ) in Japan , an event that is often cited as igniting the post-war golf boom . Between 1960 and 1964 the number of golf courses in Japan increased from 195 to 424 . By the early 1970s there were over 1,000 courses . The 1987 Resort Law that reduced protection on agricultural land and forest preserves created a further boom in course construction and by 2009 there were over 2,400 courses . The popularity of golf in Japan also caused many golf resorts to be created across the Pacific Rim . The environmental effect of these recent golf booms is seen as a cause for concern by many .
