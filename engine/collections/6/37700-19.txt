RNA polymerase , assisted by one or more general transcription factors , then unwinds approximately 14 base pairs of DNA to form an RNA polymerase - promoter `` open complex '' . In the `` open complex '' the promoter DNA is partly unwound and single - stranded . The exposed , single - stranded DNA is referred to as the `` transcription bubble . ''
