The specific causes of non-homologous crossover events are unknown , but several influential factors are known to increase the likelihood of an unequal crossover . One common vector leading to unbalanced recombination is the repair of double - strand breaks ( DSBs ) . DSBs are often repaired using non-homologous end joining , a process which involves invasion of a template strand by the DSB strand ( see figure below ) . Nearby homologous regions of the template strand are often used for repair , which can give rise to either insertions or deletions in the genome if a non-homologous but complementary part of the template strand is used . Sequence similarity is a major player in crossover -- crossover events are more likely to occur in long regions of close identity on a gene . This means that any section of the genome with long sections of repetitive DNA is prone to crossover events .
