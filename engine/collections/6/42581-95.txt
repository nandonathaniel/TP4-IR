In the 200th episode and series finale , it is December 31 , 1979 , the final day of the 1970s . In a bit of a clip show , all the characters reminisce about the decade . Hyde helps a hesitant Kitty and Red decide about moving . Fez searches for the perfect time and place for his first kiss with Jackie while Kelso returns to spend the last night of the 1970s with his friends . Kelso also falls off the water tower ( again ) , after being tricked by Fez and Hyde . Red and Kitty announce to their guests that they decided not to move to Florida . As Donna leaves the room for some air , Eric returns just in time for New Year 's Eve . He apologizes to Donna , who says things `` are a lot different now '' , and they kiss and reconcile . Eric then joins the guys in the final `` circle '' of the decade when Donna and Jackie tell them to get upstairs . But before they do , Eric states the last person upstairs has to call Red a dumbass . Everyone races upstairs , leaving Kelso behind after Hyde pushes him . Kelso is the final character to be seen as he grabs `` the stupid helmet '' and prepares to call Red a dumbass . As the 1970s end , the episode ends in a final shot of the Formans ' basement with the kids and adults upstairs counting down to one ( with the episode ending abruptly just as they reach `` one '' , and the ' 70s officially end ) . Then shows the car license plate one last time reading `` That ' 70s Show '' along with the year saying 80 . The credits show the gang from season 1 singing Hello it 's Me by Todd Rundgren .
