Veronica is a female given name , the Latin transliteration of the Greek name Berenice , Βερενίκη . This was the Macedonian form of the Athenian Φερενίκη , Phereníkē , or Φερονίκη , Pheroníkē , from φέρειν , phérein , to bring , and νίκη , níkê , `` victory '' , i.e. `` she who brings victory '' . The Ancient Macedonian form of the name was popularized because of its extensive use as a royal feminine name by the reigning dynasties of the states of the Diadochi of Alexander the Great throughout the Eastern Mediterranean during the Hellenistic age , most notably by the Ptolemies of Egypt and by the Seleucids of Asia . In medieval etymology , Veronica was sometimes wrongly supposed to derive from Latin vera ( true ) and Greek eikon ( image ) . Its popularity in medieval and modern times is based mainly on the importance in Christianity of Saint Veronica and her Veil of Veronica . Pet forms of Veronica include Ronnie and Roni and the German Frony . In Russian , the pet form is Nika ( Ника ) . `` Veronica '' is a popular name in many countries in the Mediterranean , Eastern Europe , and Latin America , as well as southern Ireland , France , and French - speaking Canada .
