While the Browns ' on - field play in 1956 was uninspiring , off - the - field drama developed after a Cleveland - based inventor named George Sarles let Brown test a helmet with a radio transmitter inside . After trying it out in training camp , Brown used the helmet to call in plays during a September 15 preseason game against the Lions with Ratterman behind center . The device allowed the coach to direct his quarterback on the fly , giving him an advantage over franchises which had to use messenger players to relay instructions . The Browns used the device off and on into the regular season , and other teams began to experiment with their own radio helmets . The NFL 's commissioner at the time , Bert Bell , banned the device in October 1956 . Today , however , all NFL teams use in - helmet radios to communicate with players .
