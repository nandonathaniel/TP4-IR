Principal photography began on October 6 , 1975 in Lake Powell . A rift between Eastwood and Kaufman developed during the filming . Kaufman insisted on filming with a meticulous attention to detail , which caused disagreements with Eastwood , not to mention the attraction the two shared towards Locke and apparent jealousy on Kaufman 's part in regards to their emerging relationship . One evening , Kaufman insisted on finding a beer can as a prop to be used in a scene , but while he was absent , Eastwood ordered Surtees to quickly shoot the scene as light was fading and then drove away , leaving before Kaufman had returned . Soon after , filming moved to Kanab , Utah . On October 24 , 1975 , Kaufman was fired at Eastwood 's command by producer Bob Daley . The sacking caused an outrage amongst the Directors Guild of America and other important Hollywood executives , since the director had already worked hard on the film , including completing all of the pre-production . Pressure mounted on Warner Bros. and Eastwood to back down , but their refusal to do so resulted in a fine , reported to be around $60,000 for the violation . This resulted in the Director 's Guild passing new legislation , known as ' the Eastwood Rule ' , which prohibits an actor or producer from firing the director and then becoming the director himself . From then on , the film was directed by Eastwood himself with Daley second - in - command , but with Kaufman 's planning already in place , the team were able to finish making the film efficiently .
