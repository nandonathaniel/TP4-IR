Similar to the Cork accent but without the same intonation , Kerry puts even heavier emphasis on the brrr sound to the letter R. For example : the word Forty . Throughout the south this word is pronounced whereby the r exhibits the typified Irish brrr . In Kerry however ( especially in rural areas ) the roll on the r is enforced with vibrations from the tongue ( not unlike Scottish here ) . `` Are you ? '' becomes a co-joined `` A-rrou ? '' single tongue flutter ( esp. in rural areas ) . This extra emphasis on R is also seen in varying measures through parts of West Limerick and West Cork in closer proximity to Kerry .
