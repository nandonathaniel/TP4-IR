After the outbreak of German - Soviet hostilities , Soviet forces were quickly driven out by German forces . Initially , the German forces were almost universally hailed as liberators , but Nazi occupation policies gradually changed that . Riga was retaken by Soviet forces on 13 October 1944 , and a major part of the German Army Group North ( Heersgruppe Nord ) was cut off in Kurzeme , the peninsula that forms the northwestern part of Latvia . There they locally raised Latvian units and formed the `` Kurland Fortress '' , which successfully held out until the end of the war .
