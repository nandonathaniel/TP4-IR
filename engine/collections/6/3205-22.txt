This map appears in a copy of a classical work on geography , the Latin version by Priscian of the Periegesis , that was among the manuscripts in the Cotton library ( MS . Tiberius B.V. , fol . 56v ) , now in the British Library . It is not intended purely as an illustration to that work , for it contains much material gathered from other sources , including some which would have been the most up - to - date available , although it is based on a distant Roman original ( similar to the source of another 11th - century world map , illustrating an edition of Isidore of Seville ) -- on which the network of lines appears to indicate the boundaries of imperial provinces . The date of drawing was formerly estimated at about CE 992 -- 994 , based on suggested links to the journey of Archbishop Sigeric of Canterbury from Rome but more recent analysis indicates that , although the information was revised about that time , the map was probably drawn between 1025 and 1050 .
