On March 28 , 2013 , FX president John Landgraf announced their upcoming launch of a new channel , FXX , described as `` slightly more comedy focused '' and aimed at younger audiences 18 - 34 compared with FX 's programming and viewers aged 25 -- 54 , respectively . The channel was launched alongside the new tagline , `` Fearless '' , that was implemented during 2013 across the channels of FX Networks . These announcements were part of FX Networks ' plans to further distinguish itself from `` the sameness of broadcast TV and its endless basic cable imitators . ''
