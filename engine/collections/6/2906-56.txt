David Ng of the Los Angeles Times describes architecture as a star of the film . Tom is seen reading Alain de Botton 's The Architecture of Happiness . The film was originally set in San Francisco but was later moved to Los Angeles and the script rewritten to make better use of the location . Buildings used include the Los Angeles Music Center ( which includes the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion ) and the towers of California Plaza . The older Fine Arts Building is featured in the film , in a scene where Tom shows it to Summer and mentions its designers , Walker and Eisen , two of his favorite architects , although he incorrectly gives the partners ' names as `` Walker and Eisner .
