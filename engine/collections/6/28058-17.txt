Modern space research in India is most visibly traced to the 1920s , when the scientist S.K. Mitra conducted a series of experiments leading to the sounding of the ionosphere by application of ground based radio methods in Calcutta . Later , Indian scientists like C.V. Raman and Meghnad Saha contributed to scientific principles applicable in space sciences . However , it was the period after 1945 that saw important developments being made in coordinated space research in India . Organised space research in India was spearheaded by two scientists : Vikram Sarabhai -- founder of the Physical Research Laboratory at Ahmedabad -- and Homi Bhabha , who established the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research in 1945 . Initial experiments in space sciences included the study of cosmic radiation , high altitude and airborne testing of instruments , deep underground experimentation at the Kolar mines -- one of the deepest mining sites in the world -- and studies of the upper atmosphere . Studies were carried out at research laboratories , universities , and independent locations .
