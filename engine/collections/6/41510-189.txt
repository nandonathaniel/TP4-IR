Sikh support for the British resulted from grievances surrounding sepoys ' perceived conduct during and after the Anglo - Sikh Wars . Firstly , many Sikhs resented that Hindustanis / Purbiyas in service of the Sikh state had been foremost in urging the wars , which lost them their independence . Sikh soldiers also recalled that the bloodiest battles of the war , Chillianwala and Ferozeshah , were won by British troops , and they believed that the Hindustani sepoys had refused to meet them in battle . These feelings were compounded when Hindustani sepoys were assigned a very visible role as garrison troops in Punjab and awarded profit - making civil posts in Punjab .
