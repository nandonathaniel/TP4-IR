Indigenous healing practices are extremely diverse throughout Asia but often follow certain patterns and are still prevalent today . Many traditional healing practices include shamanism and herbal medicines , and may have been passed down orally in small groups or even institutionalized and professionalized . In many developing countries the only health care available until a few decades ago were those based on traditional medicine and spiritual healing . Now governments must be careful to create health policies that strike a balance between modernity and tradition . Organizations , like the World Health Organization , try to create policies that respect tradition without trying to replace it with modern science , instead regulating it to ensure safety but keeping it accessible . India in particular tries to make traditional medicines safe but still available to as many people as possible , adapting tradition to match modernization while still considering the economic positions and culture of its citizens .
