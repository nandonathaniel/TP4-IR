Norte Chico is unusual in that it completely lacked ceramics and apparently had almost no visual art . Nevertheless , the civilization exhibited impressive architectural feats , including large earthwork platform mounds and sunken circular plazas , and an advanced textile industry . The platform mounds , as well as large stone warehouses , provide evidence for a stratified society and a centralized authority necessary to distribute resources such as cotton . However , there is no evidence of warfare or defensive structures during this period . Originally , it was theorized that , unlike other early civilizations , Norte Chico developed by relying on maritime food sources in place of a staple cereal . This hypothesis , the Maritime Foundation of Andean Civilization , is still hotly debated ; however , most researches now agree that agriculture played a central role in the civilization 's development while still acknowledging a strong supplemental reliance on maritime proteins .
