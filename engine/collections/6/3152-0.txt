Relative atomic mass ( symbol : A ) or atomic weight is a dimensionless physical quantity defined as the ratio of the average mass of atoms of a chemical element in a given sample to one unified atomic mass unit . The unified atomic mass unit ( symbol : u or Da ) is defined as being ​ ⁄ of the atomic mass of a carbon - 12 atom . Since both values in the ratio are expressed in the same unit ( u ) , the resulting value is dimensionless ; hence the value is said to be relative .
