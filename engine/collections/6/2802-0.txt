A deep - cycle battery is a lead - acid battery designed to be regularly deeply discharged using most of its capacity . In contrast , starter batteries ( e.g. most automotive batteries ) are designed to deliver short , high - current bursts for cranking the engine , thus frequently discharging only a small part of their capacity . While a deep - cycle battery can be used as a starting battery , the lower `` cranking current '' implies that an oversized battery may be required .
