In 1839 , the New Zealand Company announced its plans to establish colonies in New Zealand . This and the increased commercial interests of merchants in Sydney and London spurred the British to take stronger action . Captain William Hobson was sent to New Zealand to persuade MƒÅori to cede their sovereignty to the British Crown . In reaction to the New Zealand Company 's moves , on 15 June 1839 a new Letters patent was issued to expand the territory of New South Wales to include all of New Zealand . Governor of New South Wales George Gipps was appointed Governor over New Zealand . This was the first clear expression of British intent to annexe New Zealand .
