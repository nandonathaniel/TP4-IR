Common mechanisms of injury : Cubital tunnel syndrome , fracture of the medial epicondyle ( causing cubitus valgus with tardy ulnar nerve palsy ) Motor deficit : Weakness in flexion of the hand at the wrist , loss of flexion of ulnar half of digits , or the 4th and 5th digits , loss of ability to cross the digits of the hand . ( Note : Motor deficit is absent or very minor in cubital tunnel syndrome as the ulnar nerve is compressed in the cubital tunnel , rather than transected . ) Presence of a claw hand deformity when the hand is at rest , due to hyperextension of the 4th and 5th digits at the metacarpophalangeal joints , and flexion at the interphalangeal joints . Weakness of adduction of the thumb , which may be assessed by the presence of Froment 's sign . Sensory deficit : Loss of sensation or paresthesiae in ulnar half of the palm and dorsum of hand , and the medial 11‚ÅÑ2 digits on both palmar and dorsal aspects of the hand
