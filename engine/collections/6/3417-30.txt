The position was abolished with the annexation of Texas , largely due to President Anson Jones , who received the nickname `` The architect of Annexation '' and served only one year and three months . The amount of power wielded by occupants of the office varied tremendously during the nine years of Texas ' independence . Particularly in the beginning , there was a larger military need than in the 1840s , and the president therefore had considerably more power and influence than during years of relative peace . However , there is no record of any president violating or changing the Texas Constitution .
