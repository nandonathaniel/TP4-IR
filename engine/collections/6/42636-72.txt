When there are two or more cross-walls , the classification depends on spore shape . If the septae are transversal , like the rungs of a ladder , it is a phragmospore , and if they possess a net - like structure it is a dictyospore . In staurospores ray - like arms radiate from a central body ; in others ( helicospores ) the entire spore is wound up in a spiral like a spring . Very long worm - like spores with a length - to - diameter ratio of more than 15 : 1 , are called scolecospores .
