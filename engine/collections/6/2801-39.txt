Not all eukaryotic cells have each of the organelles listed below . Exceptional organisms have cells that do not include some organelles that might otherwise be considered universal to eukaryotes ( such as mitochondria ) . There are also occasional exceptions to the number of membranes surrounding organelles , listed in the tables below ( e.g. , some that are listed as double - membrane are sometimes found with single or triple membranes ) . In addition , the number of individual organelles of each type found in a given cell varies depending upon the function of that cell .
