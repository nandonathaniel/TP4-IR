The main focus of the video is an imposing man with sunglasses and a trench coat , akin to a Reaper . Bone are among the few who can see the man , and watch him as he gathers souls of various individuals who are marked for death , such as a young man who leaves his distraught mother behind ( presumably have died after entering life as a gang member ) , Bone 's friend Mike G , Wish Bone 's uncle Charles , Eazy - E , and a newborn baby ( possibly to have died from a childbirth complication ) . The Reaper then leads the souls , with the baby in his arms , up a mountain where he reveals himself to be an angel , then takes the dead to Heaven .
