The eyes of some pigeons contain yellow fluorescing pigments known as pteridines . The bright yellow eyes of the great horned owl are thought to be due to the presence of the pteridine pigment xanthopterin within certain chromatophores ( called xanthophores ) located in the iris stroma . In humans , yellowish specks or patches are thought to be due to the pigment lipofuscin , also known as lipochrome . Many animals such as canines , domestic cats , owls , eagles , pigeons and fish have amber eyes as a common color , whereas in humans this color occurs less frequently .
