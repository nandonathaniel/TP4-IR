Galadriel 's theme , in a martial setting , is used for Elrond 's Riders assaulting the Warg riders . More so than scoring the moment , the music seems to connect it to the arrival of the Host of the Eldar in The Lord of the Lords , or perhaps to prefigure the encounter with Galadriel in the White Council .
