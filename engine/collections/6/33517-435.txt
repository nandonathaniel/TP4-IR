Citations may be accompanied by metadata , though it is not mandatory . Most citation templates on Wikipedia use the COinS standard . Metadata such as this allow browser plugins and other automated software to make citation data accessible to the user , for instance by providing links to their library 's online copies of the cited works . In articles that format citations manually , metadata may be added manually in a span , according to the COinS specification .
