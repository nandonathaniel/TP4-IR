On October 24 , 1929 , the stock market crashed , plunging the entire nation into the Great Depression . If Prohibition had been unpopular in Cleveland in its early days , it was even more unpopular during the Depression . Tired of gang wars in Cleveland and Chicago , Fred G. Clark founded an anti-gang , anti-Prohibition group called the Crusaders . The group formed `` battalions '' of `` militant young men '' into chapters nationwide . Cleveland became their national headquarters , and by 1932 the Crusaders claimed one million members . The Women 's Organization for National Prohibition Reform was another group formed in Cleveland that also rose to prominence .
