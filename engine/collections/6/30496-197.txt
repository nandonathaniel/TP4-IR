In November 1797 , working with the new decimal - based Republican Calendar , the week of which has ten days , the Directory replaced Sundays and religious holidays with republican celebrations . The tenth day of the week , called decadi , was designated to replace Sunday . The churches still functioning with Constitutional priests were instructed to have mass on decadi , rather than on the day that would have been Sunday in the previous calendar , and decadi became the official non-working day : government employees were off , and schools , shops and markets were closed . To replace saints ' and religious days , a whole series of secular holidays was created , in addition to the patriotic celebrations already in place , such as 14 of July and important dates of the French Revolution . There were also special days , such as , `` the day of the sovereignty of the people '' ; `` the day of youth '' ; `` the day of spouses '' ; `` the day of agriculture '' and `` the day of the elderly '' . Certain churches were given new names : the cathedral Notre Dame de Paris was renamed `` Temple of the Supreme Being '' , Saint - Ã‰tienne - du - Mont became the `` Temple of Filial piety '' . On decadi , the constitutional priests who performed services were required to share the space with other republican religions and associations who wanted to use the buildings . Large churches were divided into sections for use by various religions .
