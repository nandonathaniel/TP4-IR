Females of the freshwater shrimp Caridina ensifera are capable of storing sperm from multiple partners , and thus can produce progeny with different paternities . Reproductive success of sires was found to correlate inversely with their genetic relatedness to the mother . This finding suggests that sperm competition and / or pre - and post-copulatory female choice occurs . Female choice may increase the fitness of progeny by reducing inbreeding depression that ordinarily results from the expression of homozygous deleterious recessive mutations .
