The Islamic calendar , however , is based on a different set of conventions being used for the determination of the month - start - dates . Each month still has either 29 or 30 days , but due to the variable method of observations employed , there is usually in no discernible order in the sequencing of either 29 or 30 day month lengths . Traditionally , the first day of each month is the day ( beginning at sunset ) of the first sighting of the hilal ( crescent moon ) shortly after sunset . If the hilal is not observed immediately after the 29th day of a month ( either because clouds block its view or because the western sky is still too bright when the moon sets ) , then the day that begins at that sunset is the 30th . Such a sighting has to be made by one or more trustworthy men testifying before a committee of Muslim leaders . Determining the most likely day that the hilal could be observed was a motivation for Muslim interest in astronomy , which put Islam in the forefront of that science for many centuries . Still , due to the fact that both lunar reckoning systems are ultimately based on the lunar cycle itself , both systems still do roughly correspond to one another , never being more than three days out of synch with one another .
