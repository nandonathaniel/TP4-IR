If a person is convicted of both impaired operation / care or control and operation / care or control with a BAC in excess of 0.08 percent , the defendant can only be sentenced for one of the offences ( the prosecutor chooses which one ) . The same does not apply if a person is also convicted of a refuse to comply offence .
