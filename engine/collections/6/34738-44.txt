In some markets where leasing arrangements for vehicles are available , the only requirement for driving for Uber , other than appropriate age , health , car age and type , and ability to drive , is passing a background check . Both a smartphone or tablet , and a vehicle may be leased . In many cities , vehicles used by Uber drivers must pass annual safety inspections and must have an Uber emblem posted in the passenger window .
