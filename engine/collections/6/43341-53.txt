Kaya Scodelario as Carina Barbossa ( n√©e Smyth ) : A headstrong , altruistic astronomer . Scodelario explained the character 's motivation and role saying , `` she is an academic , she 's fighting for the right to study at university because women could n't at that time . So she 's on her own journey -- looking for the trident of Poseidon -- and she has a diary with clues . '' She discussed the difference between Carina and Elizabeth Swann , believing that she was not just a carbon copy of that character . For the directors , it was important to `` modernise it with Henry and Carina , Kaya , especially brought that with her . She 's a modern woman . '' Scodelario worked with Nathanson to ensure the character was unique to the series and prevent her from being a `` Mary Sue archetype '' , saying that `` she 's got her flaws ... that 's such an important thing to include when building a character , especially female characters , who often fall into two camps ; they are either pretty and perfectly put together or completely insane . Carina has definitely got a little bit of both . ''
