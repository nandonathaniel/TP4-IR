When creating a new team , one is given the option of choosing its main strength ( for example defense , running , batting , balanced , etc . ) . This does not mean that a chosen strength will remain with the team forever . The option simply favors the chosen attribute when the computer randomly generates the players . Each new team gets about $30,000 and 18 players ( 5 pitchers , 8 batters , and 5 pinch hitters ) to start . From there , games are played and games that are won earn money for the team . Players on created teams can be modified and improved as well as traded amongst other created teams . A pitcher can not be traded for a batter ; it must always be batter for batter or pitcher for pitcher . There is also a free agent market in which players can be bought ranging in price from $5,000 to $2,980,000 . Since there is a limit of 18 players per team , before a free agent can be bought , a player must be fired . If a player is traded for a player with superior attributes , the better player 's attributes are diminished . Each player also has a maximum amount of attribute points possible ( out of 90 ) with some players having higher eventual potential than others .
