The Pan-American Highway is a network of roads measuring about 30,000 kilometres ( 19,000 mi ) in total length . Except for a rainforest break of approximately 160 km ( 100 mi ) , called the Darién Gap , the road links almost all of the Pacific coastal countries of the Americas in a connected highway system . According to Guinness World Records , the Pan-American Highway is the world 's longest `` motorable road '' . However , because of the Darién Gap , it is not possible to cross between South America and Central America with conventional highway vehicles . Without an all - terrain vehicle , it is necessary to circumnavigate this terrestrial stretch by sea .
