Has it ever pained us that our mothers and sisters have to defecate in open ? Poor womenfolk of the village wait for the night ; until darkness descends , they ca n't go out to defecate . What bodily torture they must be feeling , how many diseases that act might engender . Ca n't we just make arrangements for toilets for the dignity of our mothers and sisters ?
