The 1990 movie science fiction film Total Recall features a red pill which is offered to Arnold Schwarzenegger 's character , Douglas Quaid , by one Dr. Edgemar . He is told `` it 's a symbol -- of your desire to return to reality . '' No blue pill is present in the film , and the story centers on the uncertainty of whether Quaid is dreaming or in the real world . However , the pill is offered to him with the claim that he is dreaming , and that the pill will return him to reality , with the words `` inside your dream , you 'll fall asleep . '' Quaid seriously considers the offer but notices that Dr. Edgemar is sweating , whereupon he shoots him in the forehead . ( The implication is that if the dream is real , Dr. Edgemar is part of the conspiracy against Quaid , and the pill is simply poison . ) He had also told Quaid that if Quaid kills him , `` the walls of reality will come crashing down '' ; moments after his death , the walls of the apartment literally come crashing down .
