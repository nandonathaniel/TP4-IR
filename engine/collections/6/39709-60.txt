Champions of Meucci , Manzetti , and Gray have each offered fairly precise tales of a contrivance whereby Bell actively stole the invention of the telephone from their specific inventor . In the 2002 congressional resolution , it was inaccurately noted that Bell worked in a laboratory in which Meucci 's materials had been stored , and claimed that Bell must thus have had access to those materials . Manzetti claimed that Bell visited him and examined his device in 1865 . And it is alleged that Bell bribed a patent examiner , Zenas Wilber , not only into processing his application before Gray 's , but allowing a look at his rival 's designs before final submission .
