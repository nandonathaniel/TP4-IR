Fire : Bonfires are lit , usually around midnight both on beaches and inland , so much so that one usually can not tell the smoke from the mist common in this Atlantic corner of Iberia at this time of the year , and it smells burnt everywhere . Occasionally , a dummy is placed at the top , representing a witch or the devil . Young and old gather around them and feast mostly on pilchards , potatoes boiled in their skins and maize bread . When it is relatively safe to jump over the bonfire , it is done three times ( although it could also be nine or any odd number ) for good luck at the cry of `` meigas fora '' ( witches off ! ). It is also common to drink Queimada , a beverage resulting from setting alight Galician grappa mixed with sugar , coffee beans and pieces of fruit , which is prepared while chanting an incantation against evil spirits .
