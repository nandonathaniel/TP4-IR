In popular culture , tropical cyclones have made several appearances in different types of media , including films , books , television , music , and electronic games . These media often portray tropical cyclones that are either entirely fictional or based on real events . For example , George Rippey Stewart 's Storm , a best - seller published in 1941 , is thought to have influenced meteorologists on their decision to assign female names to Pacific tropical cyclones . Another example is the hurricane in The Perfect Storm , which describes the sinking of the Andrea Gail by the 1991 Perfect Storm . Hypothetical hurricanes have been featured in parts of the plots of series such as The Simpsons , Invasion , Family Guy , Seinfeld , Dawson 's Creek , Burn Notice and CSI : Miami . The 2004 film The Day After Tomorrow includes several mentions of actual tropical cyclones and features fantastical `` hurricane - like '' , albeit non-tropical , Arctic storms .
