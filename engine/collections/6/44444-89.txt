Fingerprinting was the basis upon which the first forensic professional organization was formed , the International Association for Identification ( IAI ) , in 1915 . The first professional certification program for forensic scientists was established in 1977 , the IAI 's Certified Latent Print Examiner program , which issued certificates to those meeting stringent criteria and had the power to revoke certification where an individual 's performance warranted it . Other forensic disciplines have followed suit and established their own certification programs .
