In some snakes , most notably boas and pythons , there are vestiges of the hindlimbs in the form of a pair of pelvic spurs . These small , claw - like protrusions on each side of the cloaca are the external portion of the vestigial hindlimb skeleton , which includes the remains of an ilium and femur .
