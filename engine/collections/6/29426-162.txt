Staten Island ( Richmond County ) is the most suburban in character of the five boroughs . Staten Island is connected to Brooklyn by the Verrazano - Narrows Bridge and to Manhattan by way of the free Staten Island Ferry , a daily commuter ferry which provides unobstructed views of the Statue of Liberty , Ellis Island , and Lower Manhattan . In central Staten Island , the Staten Island Greenbelt spans approximately 2,500 acres ( 10 km ) , including 28 miles ( 45 km ) of walking trails and one of the last undisturbed forests in the city . Designated in 1984 to protect the island 's natural lands , the Greenbelt comprises seven city parks .
