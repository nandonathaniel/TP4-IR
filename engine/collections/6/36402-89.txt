High concentrations of oxygen can cause oxygen toxicity such as lung damage or result in respiratory failure in those who are predisposed . It can also dry out the nose and increase the risk of fires in those who smoke . The target oxygen saturation recommended depends on the condition being treated . In most conditions a saturation of 94 - 98 % is recommended , while in those at risk of carbon dioxide retention saturations of 88 - 92 % are preferred , and in those with carbon monoxide toxicity or cardiac arrest the saturation should be as high as possible .
