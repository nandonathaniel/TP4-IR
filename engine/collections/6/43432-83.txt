Murad captured Ni≈° in 1386 , perhaps forcing Lazar of Serbia to accept Ottoman vassalage soon afterward . While he pushed deeper into the north -- central Balkans , Murad also had forces moving west along the ' ' Via Ingatia ' ' into Macedonia , forcing vassal status on regional rulers who until that time had escaped that fate . One contingent reached the Albanian Adriatic coast in 1385 . Another took and occupied Thessaloniki in 1387 . The danger to the continued independence of the Balkan Christian states grew alarmingly apparent .
