Olga Fikotová was a discus - thrower at the 1956 Summer Olympics and the only athlete to win a gold medal for her home country Czechoslovakia in that year . She began a much - publicised romance with American athlete Harold Connolly , much to the frustration of the Communist authorities . Fikotová was accused of being a traitor and the Czechoslovak Olympic Committee banned her from representing her country again . Now living in the U.S. , she would go on to compete for her adopted country in the next four Summer Games . Despite not being able to replicate her success , Fikotová was chosen to lead the American team at the 1972 Games in Munich , West Germany .
