Capital punishment in Australia has been abolished in all jurisdictions . Queensland abolished the death penalty in 1922 . Tasmania did the same in 1968 , the federal government abolished the death penalty in 1973 , with application also in the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory . Victoria did so in 1975 , South Australia in 1976 , and Western Australia in 1984 . New South Wales abolished the death penalty for murder in 1955 , and for all crimes in 1985 . In 2010 , the federal government passed legislation prohibiting the re-establishment of capital punishment by any state or territory . Neither the Commonwealth nor any of the states will extradite or deport a prisoner to another jurisdiction if they will face the death penalty , and police co-operation with other countries which have the death penalty has been questioned .
