Wind flows from areas of high pressure to areas of low pressure . This is due to density differences between the two air masses . Since stronger high - pressure systems contain cooler or drier air , the air mass is more dense and flows towards areas that are warm or moist , which are in the vicinity of low pressure areas in advance of their associated cold fronts . The stronger the pressure difference , or pressure gradient , between a high - pressure system and a low - pressure system , the stronger the wind . The coriolis force caused by the Earth 's rotation is what gives winds within high - pressure systems their clockwise circulation in the northern hemisphere ( as the wind moves outward and is deflected right from the center of high pressure ) and counterclockwise circulation in the southern hemisphere ( as the wind moves outward and is deflected left from the center of high pressure ) . Friction with land slows down the wind flowing out of high - pressure systems and causes wind to flow more outward than would be the case in the absence of friction . This is known as a geostrophic wind .
