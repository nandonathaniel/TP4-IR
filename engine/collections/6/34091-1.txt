Amid high food prices in 1972 , Sweden 's National Board of Health and Welfare developed the idea of `` basic foods '' that were both cheap and nutritious , and `` supplemental foods '' that added nutrition missing from the basic foods . Anna - Britt Agnsäter , chief of the `` test kitchen '' for Kooperativa Förbundet ( a cooperative Swedish retail chain ) , held a lecture the next year on how to illustrate these food groups . Attendee Fjalar Clemes suggested a triangle displaying basic foods at the base . Agnsäter developed the idea into the first food pyramid , which was introduced to the public in 1974 in KF 's Vi magazine . The pyramid was divided into basic foods at the base , including milk , cheese , margarine , bread , cereals and potato ; a large section of supplemental vegetables and fruit ; and an apex of supplemental meat , fish and egg . The pyramid competed with the National Board 's `` dietary circle , '' which KF saw as problematic for resembling a cake divided into seven slices , and for not indicating how much of each food should be eaten . While the Board distanced itself from the pyramid , KF continued to promote it , and food pyramids were developed in other Scandinavian countries , as well as West Germany , Japan and Sri Lanka . The United States later developed its first food pyramid in 1992 .
