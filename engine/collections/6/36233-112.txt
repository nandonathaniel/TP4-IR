`` Even as with the American rejection of the League of Nations , our failure to live up to our obligations to the United Nations is led by a handful of willful senators who choose to pursue their narrow , selfish political objectives at the cost of our nation 's conscience . They pander to and are supported by the Christian Coalition and the rest of the religious right wing . Their leader , Pat Robertson , has written that we should have a world government but only when the messiah arrives . Any attempt to achieve world order before that time must be the work of the Devil ! Well join me ... I 'm glad to sit here at the right hand of Satan . ''
