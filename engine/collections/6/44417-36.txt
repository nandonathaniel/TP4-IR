I think we were fairly smart with `` Spoonman '' in that you really do n't see us that much in the video . You see various pictures of us , but it 's not quite the same as having us in your living room all the time . We 're trying to maintain some degree of mystique about Soundgarden , I guess . I remember back when I was a kid , long before MTV , and the only way to see my favorite bands was to go to their concerts . It was an incredible experience . MTV has helped a lot of bands , but they 've also helped rob a lot of groups of that special mystique . It 's tough when you can see a great rock band on TV one second , then hit the clicker and be watching a soap opera or a sitcom the next . That 's what rock and roll has become for some people .
