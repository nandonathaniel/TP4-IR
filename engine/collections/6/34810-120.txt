A central theme here , as in other of Dickens 's novels , is of people living as social outcasts . The novel opening emphasises this in the case of the orphaned Pip , who lives in an isolated foggy environment next to a graveyard , dangerous swamps , and prison ships . His very existence reproaches him : `` I was always treated as if I had insisted on being born in opposition to the dictates of reason , religion and morality '' .
