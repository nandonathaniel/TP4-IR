A fielder is allowed to reach over the wall to attempt to catch the ball as long as his feet are on or over the field during the attempt , and if the fielder successfully catches the ball while it is in flight the batter is out , even if the ball had already passed the vertical plane of the wall . However , since the fielder is not part of the field , a ball that bounces off a fielder ( including his glove ) and over the wall without touching the ground is still a home run . A fielder may not deliberately throw his glove , cap , or any other equipment or apparel to stop or deflect a fair ball , and an umpire may award a home run to the batter if a fielder does so on a ball that , in the umpire 's judgment , would have otherwise been a home run ( this is rare in modern professional baseball ) .
