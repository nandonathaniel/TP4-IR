Most modern operating systems employ a method of extending RAM capacity , known as `` virtual memory '' . A portion of the computer 's hard drive is set aside for a paging file or a scratch partition , and the combination of physical RAM and the paging file form the system 's total memory . ( For example , if a computer has 2 GB of RAM and a 1 GB page file , the operating system has 3 GB total memory available to it . ) When the system runs low on physical memory , it can `` swap '' portions of RAM to the paging file to make room for new data , as well as to read previously swapped information back into RAM . Excessive use of this mechanism results in thrashing and generally hampers overall system performance , mainly because hard drives are far slower than RAM .
