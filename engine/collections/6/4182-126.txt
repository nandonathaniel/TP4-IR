The effectiveness of strict psychoanalysis is difficult to gauge ; therapy as Freud intended it relies too much on the interpretation of the therapist which can not be proven . The effectiveness of more modern , developed techniques can be gauged . Meta - analyses in 2012 and 2013 come to the conclusion that there is support or evidence for the efficacy of psychoanalytic therapy , thus further research is needed . Other meta - analyses published in the recent years showed psychoanalysis and psychodynamic therapy to be effective , with outcomes comparable or greater than other kinds of psychotherapy or antidepressant drugs , but these arguments have also been subjected to various criticisms .
