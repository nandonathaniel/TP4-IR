In May 2006 , NBC announced the new show . The audition tour took place in June . Auditions were held in the following locations : Los Angeles , New York , and Chicago .

More than 12 million viewers watched the series premiere ( which is more than American Idol got during its premiere in 2002 ) . The two - hour broadcast was the night 's most - watched program on U.S. television and the highest - rated among viewers aged 18 to 49 ( the prime - time audience that matters most to advertisers ) , Nielsen Media Research reported .
