Ovulated eggs become arrested in metaphase II until fertilization triggers the second meiotic division . Similar to the segregation events of mitosis , the pairs of sister chromatids resulting from the separation of bivalents in meiosis I are further separated in anaphase of meiosis II . In oocytes , one sister chromatid is segregated into the second polar body , while the other stays inside the egg . During spermatogenesis , each meiotic division is symmetric such that each primary spermatocyte gives rise to 2 secondary spermatocytes after meiosis I , and eventually 4 spermatids after meiosis II . Meiosis II - nondisjunction may also result in aneuploidy syndromes , but only to a much smaller extent than do segregation failures in meiosis I .
