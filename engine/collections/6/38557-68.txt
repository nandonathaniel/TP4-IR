Fritz Lang 's 1927 film Metropolis , in a flashback , plays upon themes of lack of communication between the designers of the tower and the workers who are constructing it . The short scene states how the words used to glorify the tower 's construction by its designers took on totally different , oppressive meanings to the workers . This led to its destruction as they rose up against the designers because of the insufferable working conditions . The appearance of the tower was modelled after Brueghel 's 1563 painting .
