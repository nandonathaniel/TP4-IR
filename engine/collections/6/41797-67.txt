In the original Japanese script , Kiki loses her ability to communicate with Jiji permanently , but the American version adds a line that implies that she is once again able to understand him at the end of the film . Miyazaki has said that Jiji is the immature side of Kiki , and this implies that Kiki , by the end of the original Japanese version , has matured beyond talking to her cat .
