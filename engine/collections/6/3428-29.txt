Barnes played an electric guitar on two songs , `` Sweetheart Land '' and `` It 's a Low - Down Dirty Shame '' , recorded by Big Bill Broonzy and produced by Lester Melrose in Chicago on March 1 , 1938 . Some historians attribute the first recording with electric guitar to Eddie Durham , Durham 's recording in 1935 was the first to record an electrically amplified guitar ( 1 ) with Jimmie Lunceford in ' Hittin ' The Bottle ' that was recorded in New York for the Decca label. ( 2 ) Several recordings of an electric lap steel guitar precede both , including recordings by Milton Brown and his Musical Brownies with Bob Dunn on electric lap steel as early as January 1935 . But Broonzy 's 1938 session with Barnes is the first to feature an electrically amplified ( non -- lap steel ) guitar .
