A number of technologies from the European Renaissance period were adopted by Russia rather early and subsequently perfected to become a part of a strong domestic tradition . Mostly these were military technologies , such as cannon casting adopted by at least the 15th century . The Tsar Cannon , which is the world 's largest bombard by caliber , is a masterpiece of Russian cannon making . It was cast in 1586 by Andrey Chokhov and is notable for its rich , decorative relief . Another technology , that according to one hypothesis originally was brought from Europe by the Italians , resulted in the development of vodka , the national beverage of Russia . As early as 1386 Genoese ambassadors brought the first aqua vitae ( `` water of life '' ) to Moscow and presented it to Grand Duke Dmitry Donskoy . The Genoese likely developed this beverage with the help of the alchemists of Provence , who used an Arab - invented distillation apparatus to convert grape must into alcohol . A Moscovite monk called Isidore used this technology to produce the first original Russian vodka c. 1430 .
