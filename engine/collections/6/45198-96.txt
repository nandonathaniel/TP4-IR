Unusual for a television series , the sound team receives a rough cut of a full season and approaches it as a ten - hour feature film . Although seasons one and two had different sound teams , one team has been in charge of sound since then . For the series 's blood - and - gore sounds , the team often uses a chamois . For dragon screams , mating tortoises and dolphin , seal , lion and bird sounds have been used .
