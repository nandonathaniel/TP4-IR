On March 10 , 2015 , at midnight EDT , The Weather Channel and its sister network , Weatherscan , were pulled from Verizon Fios after the two parties were unable to come to terms on a new carriage agreement . The services have respectively been replaced by the AccuWeather Network ( which launched on March 13 ) and a widget provided by Fios featuring forecast content provided by WeatherBug . No public announcement was made regarding the removal until over 12 hours after TWC and Weatherscan were pulled . The Weather Channel offered a less expensive deal to Verizon Fios , which rejected the offer . Verizon cited the wide availability of the internet and mobile apps for consumers to access weather content any time of day as the reason for dropping TWC and its services .
