Humans evolved for life in Earth gravity , and exposure to weightlessness has been shown to have deleterious effects on human health . Initially , more than 50 % of astronauts experience space motion sickness . This can cause nausea and vomiting , vertigo , headaches , lethargy , and overall malaise . The duration of space sickness varies , but it typically lasts for 1 -- 3 days , after which the body adjusts to the new environment . Longer - term exposure to weightlessness results in muscle atrophy and deterioration of the skeleton , or spaceflight osteopenia . These effects can be minimized through a regimen of exercise . Other effects include fluid redistribution , slowing of the cardiovascular system , decreased production of red blood cells , balance disorders , and a weakening of the immune system . Lesser symptoms include loss of body mass , nasal congestion , sleep disturbance , and puffiness of the face .
