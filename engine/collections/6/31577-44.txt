By the 3rd century BCE , a new indigenous alphabet , the Meroitic , consisting of twenty - three letters , replaced Egyptian script . The Meroitic script is an alphabetic script originally derived from Egyptian hieroglyphs , used to write the Meroitic language of the Kingdom of MeroÃ« / Kush . It was developed in the Napatan Period ( about 700 - 300 BCE ) , and first appears in the 2nd century BCE . For a time , it was also possibly used to write the Nubian language of the successor Nubian kingdoms .
