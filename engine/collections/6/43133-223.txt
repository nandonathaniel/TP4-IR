The plan originally called for just under 45 divisions , including a dozen panzer and Panzergrenadier divisions forming the armored spearhead and various infantry units to form a defensive line as the battle unfolded . By this time the German Army suffered from an acute manpower shortage , and the force had been reduced to around 30 divisions . Although it retained most of its armor , there were not enough infantry units because of the defensive needs in the East . These 30 newly rebuilt divisions used some of the last reserves of the German Army . Among them were Volksgrenadier ( `` People 's Grenadier '' ) units formed from a mix of battle - hardened veterans and recruits formerly regarded as too young , too old or too frail to fight . Training time , equipment and supplies were inadequate during the preparations . German fuel supplies were precarious -- those materials and supplies that could not be directly transported by rail had to be horse - drawn to conserve fuel , and the mechanized and panzer divisions would depend heavily on captured fuel . As a result , the start of the offensive was delayed from 27 November to 16 December .
