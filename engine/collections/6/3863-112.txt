Above the dense CO 2 layer are thick clouds consisting mainly of sulfuric acid droplets . The clouds also contain sulfur aerosol , about 1 % ferric chloride and some water . Other possible constituents of the cloud particles are ferric sulfate , aluminium chloride and phosphoric anhydride . Clouds at different levels have different compositions and particle size distributions . These clouds reflect and scatter about 90 % of the sunlight that falls on them back into space , and prevent visual observation of Venus 's surface . The permanent cloud cover means that although Venus is closer than Earth to the Sun , it receives less sunlight on the ground . Strong 300 km / h ( 185 mph ) winds at the cloud tops go around Venus about every four to five Earth days . Winds on Venus move at up to 60 times the speed of its rotation , whereas Earth 's fastest winds are only 10 -- 20 % rotation speed .
