The earliest basilicas ( large , aisled halls ) were introduced to the Forum in 184 BC by Marcus Porcius Cato , which began the process of `` monumentalizing '' the site . The Basilica Fulvia was dedicated on the north side of the Forum square in 179 BC . ( It was rebuilt and renamed several times , as Basilica Fulvia et Aemilia , Basilica Paulli , Basilica Aemilia ) . Nine years later , the Basilica Sempronia was dedicated on the south side .
