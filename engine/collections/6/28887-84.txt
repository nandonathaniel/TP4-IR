The election of Abraham Lincoln in November 1860 was the final trigger for secession . Efforts at compromise , including the `` Corwin Amendment '' and the `` Crittenden Compromise '' , failed . Southern leaders feared that Lincoln would stop the expansion of slavery and put it on a course toward extinction . The slave states , which had already become a minority in the House of Representatives , were now facing a future as a perpetual minority in the Senate and Electoral College against an increasingly powerful North . Before Lincoln took office in March 1861 , seven slave states had declared their secession and joined to form the Confederacy .
