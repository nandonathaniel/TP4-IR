Producer Norman Whitfield recorded `` I Heard It Through the Grapevine '' with various Motown artists . The first known recording is with the Miracles on August 6 , 1966 , though there may also have been a recording with the Isley Brothers , or at least Whitfield intended to record it with them ; however a track has not turned up -- some Motown historians believe that a session may have been scheduled but cancelled . The Miracles ' version was not released as a single due to Berry Gordy 's veto during Motown 's weekly quality control meetings ; Gordy advised Whitfield and Strong to create a stronger single . The Miracles version later appeared on their 1968 Special Occasion album , and a slightly different take , possibly from the same session but unreleased , appeared on the 1998 compilation album , Motown Sings Motown Treasures .
