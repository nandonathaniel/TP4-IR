The 1783 Treaty of Paris , which ended hostilities with Great Britain , languished in Congress for several months because too few delegates were present at any one time to constitute a quorum so that it could be ratified . Afterward , the problem only got worse as Congress had no power to enforce attendance . Rarely did more than half of the roughly sixty delegates attend a session of Congress at the time , causing difficulties in raising a quorum . The resulting paralysis embarrassed and frustrated many American nationalists , including George Washington . Many of the most prominent national leaders , such as Washington , John Adams , John Hancock , and Benjamin Franklin , retired from public life , served as foreign delegates , or held office in state governments ; and for the general public , local government and self - rule seemed quite satisfactory . This served to exacerbate Congress 's impotence .
