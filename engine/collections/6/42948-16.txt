Whilst it does not include any kind of Mass , the Church of Scotland has a service beginning just before midnight , in which carols are sung . The Church of Scotland no longer holds Hogmanay services on New Year 's Eve , however . The Christmas Eve Services are still very popular . On Christmas Eve , the Christ Candle in the center of the Advent wreath is traditionally lit in many church services . In candlelight services , while singing Silent Night , each member of the congregation receives a candle and passes along their flame which is first received from the Christ Candle .
