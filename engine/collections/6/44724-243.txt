Although gluconeogenesis and glycolysis share many intermediates the one is not functionally a branch or tributary of the other . There are two regulatory steps in both pathways which , when active in the one pathway , are automatically inactive in the other . The two processes can therefore not be simultaneously active . Indeed , if both sets of reactions were highly active at the same time the net result would be the hydrolysis of four high energy phosphate bonds ( two ATP and two GTP ) per reaction cycle .
