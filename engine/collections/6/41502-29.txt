Essentially , atomic radius decreases across the periods due to an increasing number of protons . Therefore , there is a greater attraction between the protons and electrons because opposite charges attract , and more protons creates a stronger charge . The greater attraction draws the electrons closer to the protons , decreasing the size of the particle . Therefore , atomic radius decreases . Down the groups , atomic radius increases . This is because there are more energy levels and therefore a greater distance between protons and electrons . In addition , electron shielding causes attraction to decrease , so re electrons can go farther away from the positively charged nucleus . Therefore , size ( atomic radius ) increases .
