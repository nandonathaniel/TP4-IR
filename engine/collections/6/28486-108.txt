De-urbanization reduced the scope of education , and by the 6th century teaching and learning moved to monastic and cathedral schools , with the study of biblical texts at the centre of education . Education of the laity continued with little interruption in Italy , Spain , and the southern part of Gaul , where Roman influences were more long - lasting . In the 7th century , however , learning expanded in Ireland and the Celtic lands , where Latin was a foreign language and Latin texts were eagerly studied and taught .
