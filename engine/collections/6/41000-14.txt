Robert Lewis also broke with Strasberg . In his books Method -- or Madness ? and the more autobiographical Slings and Arrows , Lewis argued that method acting was too focused on pure emotional training and neglected vocal and physical training , which forms a fundamental part both of classical actor - training and of Stanislavski 's system . The method 's reliance on emotion , he felt , could too easily encourage overacting .
