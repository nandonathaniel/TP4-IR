The first Spaniard to document the island was Juan Manuel Diaz , who charted San Francisco Bay and named one of the three islands he identified as the `` La Isla de los Alcatraces , '' which translates as `` The Island of the Pelicans , '' from the archaic Spanish alcatraz ( `` pelican '' ) . Over the years , the Spanish version `` Alcatraz '' became popular and is now widely used . In August 1827 , French Captain Auguste Bernard Duhaut - Cilly wrote `` ... running past Alcatraze 's ( Pelicans ) Island ... covered with a countless number of these birds . A gun fired over the feathered legions caused them to fly up in a great cloud and with a noise like a hurricane . '' The California brown pelican ( Pelecanus occidentalis californicus ) is not known to nest on the island today . The Spanish built several small buildings on the island and other minor structures .
