The team 's uniform did not change significantly after Nike became the NFL 's jersey supplier in 2012 , but the collar was altered to honor former Panthers player and coach Sam Mills by featuring the phrase `` Keep Pounding '' . Nike had conceived the idea , and the team supported the concept as a way to expose newer fans to the legacy of Mills , who died of cancer in 2005 . Mills had introduced the phrase , which has since become a team slogan , in a speech that he gave to the players and coaches prior to their 2003 playoff game against Dallas ; in the speech , Mills compared his fight against cancer with the team 's on - field battle , saying `` When I found out I had cancer , there were two things I could do -- quit or keep pounding . I 'm a fighter . I kept pounding . You 're fighters , too . Keep pounding ! ''
