The Covenant is not directly enforceable in Australia , but its provisions support a number of domestic laws , which confer enforceable rights on individuals . For example , Article 17 of the Convention has been implemented by the Australian Privacy Act 1988 . Likewise , the Covenant 's equality and anti-discrimination provisions support the federal Disability Discrimination Act 1992 . Finally , the Covenant is one of the major sources of ' human rights ' listed in the Human Rights ( Parliamentary Scrutiny ) Act 2011 . This law requires most new legislation and administrative instruments ( such as delegated / subordinate legislation ) to be tabled in parliament with a statement outlining the proposed law 's compatibility with the listed human rights A Joint Committee on Human Rights scrutinises all new legislation and statements of compatibility . The findings of the Joint Committee are not legally binding .
