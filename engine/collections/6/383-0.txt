Polar moment of inertia is a quantity used to predict an object 's ability to resist torsion , in objects ( or segments of objects ) with an invariant circular cross section and no significant warping or out - of - plane deformation . It is used to calculate the angular displacement of an object subjected to a torque . It is analogous to the area moment of inertia , which characterizes an object 's ability to resist bending and is required to calculate displacement .
