The theories behind the Phillips curve pointed to the inflationary costs of lowering the unemployment rate . That is , as unemployment rates fell and the economy approached full employment , the inflation rate would rise . But this theory also says that there is no single unemployment number that one can point to as the `` full employment '' rate . Instead , there is a trade - off between unemployment and inflation : a government might choose to attain a lower unemployment rate but would pay for it with higher inflation rates . In essence , in this view , the meaning of `` full employment '' is really nothing but a matter of opinion based on how the benefits of lowering the unemployment rate compare to the costs of raising the inflation rate .
