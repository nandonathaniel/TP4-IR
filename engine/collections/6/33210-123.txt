Jeremy snagged Bayon 's idol during the challenge . Ta Keo held onto their lead to place first , with Bayon placing second . After losing the challenge , Jeff Varner attempted to send a message to Wiglesworth on Bayon , but Tasha caught him and called him out . Jeff Varner then revealed that Andrew and Tasha had made multiple deals with the former Ta Keo members . Back at Angkor , the former Ta Keo members tried to stay strong against Andrew and Tasha , who targeted Jeff Varner ; however , Abi - Maria decided to align with the former Bayon members , which provoked Peih - Gee , and each of the two tried to rally support to eliminate the other . At Tribal Council , Andrew and Tasha aligned with Abi - Maria and Jeff Varner , and they sent Peih - Gee home .
