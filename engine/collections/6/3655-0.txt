Unlike most Western countries , half of the US states do not have a legal minimum age of marriage . While in most US states , individuals age 18 have the ability to marry ( with two exceptions -- Nebraska ( 19 ) and Mississippi ( 21 ) ) , all states allow minors to marry in certain circumstances , such as parental consent , judicial consent , pregnancy , or a combination of these situations . Most states allow parties aged 16 and 17 to marry with parental consent alone . In most states , children under 16 can be married too . In the 25 states which have an absolute minimum age set by statute , this age varies between 13 and 17 , while in 25 states there is no statutory minimum age if other legal conditions are met . Although in such states there is no set minimum age by statute , the traditional common law minimum age is 14 for boys and 12 for girls - ages which have been confirmed by case law in some states . Over the past 15 years , more than 200,000 minors married in US , and in Tennessee girls as young as 10 were married in 2001 .
