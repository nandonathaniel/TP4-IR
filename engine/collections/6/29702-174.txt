Although UAE has the most diversified economy in the GCC , the UAE 's economy remains extremely reliant on oil . With the exception of Dubai , most of the UAE is dependent on oil revenues . Petroleum and natural gas continue to play a central role in the economy , especially in Abu Dhabi . More than 85 % of the UAE 's economy was based on the oil exports in 2009 . While Abu Dhabi and other UAE emirates have remained relatively conservative in their approach to diversification , Dubai , which has far smaller oil reserves , was bolder in its diversification policy . In 2011 , oil exports accounted for 77 % of the UAE 's state budget . Successful efforts at economic diversification have reduced the portion of GDP based on oil / gas output to 25 % . Dubai suffered from a significant economic crisis in 2007 -- 2010 and was bailed out by Abu Dhabi 's oil wealth . Dubai is running a balanced budget , reflecting economic growth . Tourism acts as a growth sector for the entire UAE economy . Dubai is the top tourism destination in the Middle East . According to the annual MasterCard Global Destination Cities Index , Dubai is the fifth most popular tourism destination in the world . Dubai holds up to 66 % share of the UAE 's tourism economy , with Abu Dhabi having 16 % and Sharjah 10 % . Dubai welcomed 10 million tourists in 2013 . The UAE has the most advanced and developed infrastructure in the region . Since the 1980s , the UAE has been spending billions of dollars on infrastructure . These developments are particularly evident in the larger emirates of Abu Dhabi and Dubai . The northern emirates are rapidly following suit , providing major incentives for developers of residential and commercial property . Property prices in Dubai fell dramatically when Dubai World , the government construction company , sought to delay a debt payment .
