The presenters were set the challenge of building amphibious cars , and using them to get to -- and across -- a two - mile - wide reservoir . Hammond transformed a 1983 Volkswagen camper van into a narrowboat - style `` damper van ; '' Clarkson attached an outboard motor to a modified 1989 Toyota Hilux pick - up truck , which he dubbed the `` Toybota '' . May fitted a 1962 Triumph Herald with a mast and sails . This caused clearance problems on the road and he had to take an alternative route when on land due to a `` low bridge . '' Hammond 's dampervan was very heavy and slow on the road , and quickly sank after entering the water . Both the Herald and Hilux performed well in the water , however the Herald was slow due to the sails . Clarkson drove the Hilux at high speeds in the water and was making good progress , however he rolled it over while trying to enter the pier . May was eventually voted the winner by the studio audience . Winner : May
