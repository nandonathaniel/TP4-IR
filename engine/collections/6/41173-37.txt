El comes from a root word meaning might , strength , power . Sometimes referring to God and sometimes the mighty when used to refer to the God of Israel , El is almost always qualified by additional words that further define the meaning that distinguishes him from false gods . A common title of God in the Hebrew Bible is Elohim ( Hebrew : אלהים ) . The root Eloah ( אלה ) is used in poetry and late prose ( e.g. , the Book of Job ) and ending with the masculine plural suffix `` - im '' ים creating a word like ba ` alim ( `` owner ( s ) '' and adonim ( `` lord ( s ) , master ( s ) '' ) that may also indicate a singular identity .
