The test focused on the switching sequences of the electrical supplies for the reactor . The test procedure was expected to begin with an automatic emergency shutdown . No detrimental effect on the safety of the reactor was anticipated , so the test programme was not formally coordinated with either the chief designer of the reactor ( NIKIET ) or the scientific manager . Instead , it was approved only by the director of the plant ( and even this approval was not consistent with established procedures ) .
