C.S. Lewis wrote a book inspired by The Pilgrim 's Progress , called The Pilgrim 's Regress , in which a character named John follows a vision to escape from The Landlord , a less friendly version of The Owner in The Pilgrim 's Regress . It is an allegory of C.S. Lewis ' own journey from a religious childhood to a pagan adulthood in which he rediscovers his Christian God .
