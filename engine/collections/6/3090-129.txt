Christmas 2009 was a white Christmas in some parts of Britain , with thick lying snow which easterly winds had brought over the previous week . Travel over much of Britain was badly affected by ice and snow on roads , and was made more slippery by partial daytime thaw followed by overnight refreezing . It was the first white Christmas anywhere in the United Kingdom since 2004 .
