The vast majority of Southeast Asia falls within the warm , humid tropics , and its climate generally can be characterised as monsoonal . The animals of Southeast Asia are diverse ; on the islands of Borneo and Sumatra , the orangutan , the Asian elephant , the Malayan tapir , the Sumatran rhinoceros and the Bornean clouded leopard can also be found . Six subspecies of the binturong or bearcat exist in the region , though the one endemic to the island of Palawan is now classed as vulnerable .
