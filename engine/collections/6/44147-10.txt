The respiratory centre in the medulla and pons of the brainstem controls the rate and depth of respiration through various inputs . These include signals from the peripheral chemoreceptors and central chemoreceptors ; from the vagus nerve and glossopharyngeal nerve carrying input from the pulmonary stretch receptors , and other mechanoreceptors in the lungs . as well as signals from the cerebral cortex and hypothalamus .
