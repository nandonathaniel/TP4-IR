widespread failures in financial regulation , including the Federal Reserve 's failure to stem the tide of toxic mortgages ; dramatic breakdowns in corporate governance including too many financial firms acting recklessly and taking on too much risk ; an explosive mix of excessive borrowing and risk by households and Wall Street that put the financial system on a collision course with crisis ; key policy makers ill prepared for the crisis , lacking a full understanding of the financial system they oversaw ; and systemic breaches in accountability and ethics at all levels . -- Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission -- Press Release -- January 27 , 2011
