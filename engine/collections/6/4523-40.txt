The year 1980 was encoded by some manufacturers , especially General Motors and Chrysler , as `` A '' ( since the 17 - digit VIN was not mandatory until 1981 , and the `` A '' or zero was in the manufacturer 's pre-1981 placement in the VIN ) , yet Ford and AMC still used a zero for 1980 . Subsequent years increment through the allowed letters , so that `` Y '' represents the year 2000 . 2001 to 2009 are encoded as the digits 1 to 9 , and subsequent years are encoded as `` A '' , `` B '' , `` C '' , etc .
