Before this time , any oxygen produced by photosynthesis was consumed by oxidation of reduced materials , notably iron . Molecules of free oxygen did not start to accumulate in the atmosphere until the rate of production of oxygen began to exceed the availability of reducing materials that removed oxygen . This point signifies a shift from a reducing atmosphere to an oxidizing atmosphere . O showed major variations until reaching a steady state of more than 15 % by the end of the Precambrian . The following time span from 541 million years ago to the present day is the Phanerozoic Eon , during the earliest period of which , the Cambrian , oxygen - requiring metazoan life forms began to appear .
