Private schools have various missions : some cater to college - bound students seeking a competitive edge in the college admissions process ; others are for gifted students , students with learning disabilities or other special needs , or students with specific religious affiliations . Some cater to families seeking a small school , with a nurturing , supportive environment . Unlike public school systems , private schools have no legal obligation to accept any interested student . Admission to some private schools is often highly selective . Private schools also have the ability to permanently expel persistently unruly students , a disciplinary option not legally available to public school systems .
