31 handmaids and 26 commanders , and an unspecified number of civilians , have been killed in Ofglen 's attack on the Rachel and Leah Center , including Commander Pryce , while others , such as Commander Waterford , were seriously injured . Following the attack , Commander Cushing takes Commander Pryce 's role , instituting an increased number of checkpoints and having numerous people summarily executed . He questions Offred , asking who aided her when she tried to flee the country . Offred responds that she was kidnapped , an answer that Commander Cushing does not believe . Mrs. Waterford is alarmed at the possibility of her household being targeted , and is angry at his heavy - handed response to the bombing . She forges orders from her husband to have Commander Cushing arrested for treason and apostasy . Because so many handmaids were killed , some fertile women are taken back from the Colonies and are made to serve as handmaids once again , including Janine and Emily . Both reunite with Offred in the grocery store , with Janine happily telling her that it was God 's plan that she be rescued . Offred , who had been sad to discover that none of the handmaids had known Ofglen 's name , tells her real name , June , to Emily and another handmaid and following this , several of the handmaids whisper their real names to one another , which Eden overhears . Later , Mrs. Waterford enlists Offred 's help in illicitly performing the Commander 's work for him while he is in the hospital .

Through flashbacks Moira is revealed to have been a surrogate for a couple before the war . She met Odette , an obstetrician , during this process . In the present , Moira eventually finds photographs showing Odette was killed .
