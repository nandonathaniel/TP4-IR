Traditionally , the universities and institutes conducted their own admissions tests regardless of the applicants ' school record . There were no uniform measure of graduates ' abilities ; marks issued by high schools were perceived as incompatible due to grading variances between schools and regions . In 2003 the Ministry of Education launched the Unified state examination ( USE ) programme . The set of standardised tests for high school graduates , issued uniformly throughout the country and rated independent of the student 's schoolmasters , akin to North American SAT , was supposed to replace entrance exams to state universities . Thus , the reformers reasoned , the USE will empower talented graduates from remote locations to compete for admissions at the universities of their choice , at the same time eliminating admission - related bribery , then estimated at 1 billion US dollars annually . In 2003 , 858 university and college workers were indicted for bribery , admission `` fee '' in MGIMO allegedly reached 30,000 US dollars .
