In a Facebook post , fellow Monkee Michael Nesmith stated that he does not know if the Monkees belong in the Hall of Fame because he can only see the impact of the Monkees from the inside , and further stated : `` I can see the HOF ( Hall of Fame ) is a private enterprise . It seems to operate as a business , and the inductees are there by some action of the owners of the Enterprise . The inductees appear to be chosen at the owner 's pleasure . This seems proper to me . It is their business in any case . It does not seem to me that the HOF carries a public mandate , nor should it be compelled to conform to one . ''
