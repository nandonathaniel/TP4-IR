J. Brent Walker , Executive Director of the Baptist Joint Committee , responded to Hamburger 's claims noting ; `` The fact that the separation of church and state has been supported by some who exhibited an anti-Catholic animus or a secularist bent does not impugn the validity of the principle . Champions of religious liberty have argued for the separation of church and state for reasons having nothing to do with anti-Catholicism or desire for a secular culture . Of course , separationists have opposed the Catholic Church when it has sought to tap into the public till to support its parochial schools or to argue for on - campus released time in the public schools . But that principled debate on the issues does not support a charge of religious bigotry ''
