Ionisation isomerism -- the isomers give different ions in solution although they have the same composition . This type of isomerism occurs when the counter ion of the complex is also a potential ligand . For example , pentaamminebromocobalt ( III ) sulphate ( Co ( NH ) Br ) SO is red violet and in solution gives a precipitate with barium chloride , confirming the presence of sulphate ion , while pentaamminesulphatecobalt ( III ) bromide ( Co ( NH ) SO ) Br is red and tests negative for sulphate ion in solution , but instead gives a precipitate of AgBr with silver nitrate . Solvate or hydrate isomerism -- the isomers have the same composition but differ with respect to the number of molecules of solvent that serve as ligand vs simply occupying sites in the crystal . Examples : ( Cr ( H O ) ) Cl is violet colored , ( CrCl ( H O ) ) Cl H O is blue - green , and ( CrCl ( H O ) ) Cl 2H O is dark green . See water of crystallization . Linkage isomerism occurs with ambidentate ligands that can bind in more than one place . For example , NO is an ambidentate ligand : It can bind to a metal at either the N atom or an O atom . Coordination isomerism -- this occurs when both positive and negative ions of a salt are complex ions and the two isomers differ in the distribution of ligands between the cation and the anion . For example , ( Co ( NH ) ) ( Cr ( CN ) ) and ( Cr ( NH ) ) ( Co ( CN ) ) .
