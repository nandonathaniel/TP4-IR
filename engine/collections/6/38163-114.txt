20th Century Fox saw X-Men : First Class as the first film of a new X-Men trilogy . Donner compared the franchise plans to the darker , more mature content of the Harry Potter film series . Early reports said Matthew Vaughn and Singer were returning to direct and produce the sequel , respectively . While still attached to the project as a director , Vaughn said , `` First Class is similar to Batman Begins , where you have the fun of introducing the characters and getting to know them , but that takes time . But with the second one , you can just get on with it and have a rollicking good time . That 's the main difference between Batman Begins and The Dark Knight '' . Describing the possible beginning of the film , Vaughn said , `` I thought it would be fun to open with the Kennedy assassination , and we reveal that the magic bullet was controlled by Magneto '' . Singer said the film could be set around the civil rights movement or the Vietnam War , and that Wolverine could once again be featured . Singer also talked about `` changing history '' in an interview with Empire magazine . He said he does not want people to panic about events in the past `` erasing '' the storylines of the previous X-Men films , as he believes in multiverses , explaining the possibility of certain events can exist equally in the histories of alternate universes .
