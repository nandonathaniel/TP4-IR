Jughead is almost always seen wearing his trademark beanie with both a round and square pin . This type of crown - shaped cap , called a whoopee cap , was popular among boys in the 1930s and 1940s . It was made from a man 's felt fedora hat with the brim trimmed in a zig - zag and turned up . Bottle caps could be ' pinned ' in place using the cap 's removable cork lining . In the 1920s and 1930s , college freshmen were sometimes required to wear them for initiation purposes , and such caps were often worn by mechanics . Similar caps have appeared on other comic book / strip , cartoon , and children 's book characters such as Eddie Stimson in Little Lulu , Melvin Wisenheimer in Little Audrey , Skuzz in The Berenstain Bears , and Bugs Meany in Encyclopedia Brown as well as on Goober Pyle on The Andy Griffith Show and Jeff Goldblum 's character `` Freak # 1 '' in Death Wish . Jughead 's hat was recolored in black in the Filmation cartoons and pink in The New Archies . Over the course of the character 's publication , Jughead 's hat has evolved from a modified fedora to its more recognisable `` crown '' appearance .
