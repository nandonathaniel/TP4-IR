In the unaired episode `` Florence , May 1908 '' ( later released as part of The Adventures of Young Indiana Jones : The Perils of Cupid ) , Anna briefly has an affair with composer Giacomo Puccini .

In The Lost Journal of Indiana Jones , it is stated that Anna died on March 3 , 1912 , aged 33 years .
