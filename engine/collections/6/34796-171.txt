After the formation of the People 's Republic of China in 1949 , the Chinese government named the Western nations , led by the United States , as the biggest threat to its national security . Basing this judgment on China 's century of humiliation beginning in the early 19th century , U.S. support for the Nationalists during the Chinese Civil War , and the ideological struggles between revolutionaries and reactionaries , the Chinese leadership believed that China would become a critical battleground in the United States ' crusade against Communism . As a countermeasure and to elevate China 's standing among the worldwide Communist movements , the Chinese leadership adopted a foreign policy that actively promoted Communist revolutions throughout territories on China 's periphery .
