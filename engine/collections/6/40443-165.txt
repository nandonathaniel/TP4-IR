The military position of France , which seemed disastrous during the summer , improved greatly in September . On 19 September , General Brune won a victory over the British - Russian army in the Netherlands at Castricum . On 18 October , besieged by Brune at Alkmaar , the British - Russian forces under the Duke of York agreed to withdraw . In Switzerland , the Russian army had split in two . On 25 -- 26 September , the French army in Switzerland , led by André Masséna , defeated part the Russian army under Alexander Rimsky - Korsakov at the Second Battle of Zurich , and forced the rest of the Russian army , under Suvorov , into disastrous retreat across the Alps to Italy . Suvorov was furious at the Austrians , blaming them for not supporting his troops , and he urged the Czar to withdraw his forces from the war .
