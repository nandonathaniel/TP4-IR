However , women also faced many challenges during this time . A National Education Association survey showed that between 1930 and 1931 , 63 % of cities dismissed female teachers as soon as they became married , and 77 % did not hire married women as teachers . Also , a survey of 1,500 cities from 1930 to 1931 found that three - quarters of those cities did not employ married women for any jobs . In January 1932 , Congress passed the Federal Economy Act which stipulated that no two persons in the family could be working in government service at the same time ; three - fourths of employees discharged as a result of this Act were women . However , during the Great Depression white women 's unemployment rate was actually lower than that for men , because women were paid less and because men would not take what they considered to be `` women 's jobs '' such as clerical work or domestic service . Yet as a result of rising unemployment , white women 's movement into professional and technical work slowed .
