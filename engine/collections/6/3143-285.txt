Before 1900 telephones were used primarily by businesses . The number of telephones per 100 households was approximately 2 in 1900 , but the number steadily grew until it peaked at 45 in 1929 , then declined to 33 in 1933 . Automatic telephone switching , which was introduced in 1892 , eliminated the need for telephone operators to manually connect local calls on a switchboard . By 1929 , 31.9 % of the Bell system was automatic .
