The Polish determination to deploy forces directly at the German - Polish border , prompted by the Polish - British Common Defense Pact , shaped the country 's defence plan , `` Plan West '' . Poland 's most valuable natural resources , industry and population were located along the western border in Eastern Upper Silesia . Polish policy centred on their protection especially since many politicians feared that if Poland were to retreat from the regions disputed by Germany , Britain and France would sign a separate peace treaty with Germany similar to the Munich Agreement of 1938 . The fact that none of Poland 's allies had specifically guaranteed Polish borders or territorial integrity did n't help in easing Polish concerns . For these reasons , the Polish government disregarded French advice to deploy the bulk of its forces behind natural barriers such as the Vistula and San rivers , even though some Polish generals supported it as a better strategy . The West Plan did permit the Polish armies to retreat inside the country , but it was supposed to be a slow retreat behind prepared positions and was intended to give the armed forces time to complete its mobilization and execute a general counteroffensive with the support of the Western Allies .
