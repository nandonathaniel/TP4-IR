Though fairly uncommon in democracies , dictatorial regimes often declare a state of emergency that is prolonged indefinitely for the life of the regime , or for extended periods of time so that derogations can be used to override human rights of their citizens usually protected by the International Covenant on Civil and political rights . In some situations , martial law is also declared , allowing the military greater authority to act . In other situations , emergency is not declared and de facto measures taken or decree - law adopted by the government . Ms. Nicole Questiaux ( France ) and Mr. Leandro Despouy ( Argentina ) , two consecutive United Nations Special Rapporteurs , have recommended to the international community to adopt the following `` principles '' to be observed during a state or de facto situation of emergency : Principles of Legality , Proclamation , Notification , Time Limitation , Exceptional Threat , Proportionality , Non-Discrimination , Compatibility , Concordance and Complementarity of the Various Norms of International Law ( cf . `` Question of Human Rights and State of Emergency '' , E / CN. 4 / Sub. 2 / 1997 / 19 , at Chapter II ; see also Ã©tat d'exception ) .
