The `` Word of Wisdom '' is the common name of a section of the Doctrine and Covenants , a book considered by many churches within the Latter Day Saint movement to consist of revelations from God . It is also the name of a health code based on this scripture , practiced most strictly by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter - day Saints ( LDS Church ) and Mormon fundamentalists , and to a lesser extent , some other Latter Day Saint denominations . In the LDS Church , compliance with the Word of Wisdom is currently a prerequisite for baptism , service in full - time missionary work , attendance at church schools , and entry into the church 's temples ; however , violation of the code is not considered to be grounds for excommunication or other disciplinary action .
