Historically , the 1X writing speed is equivalent to the 1X reading speed , which in turn represents the speed at which a piece of media can be read in its entirety - 74 minutes . Those 74 minutes come from the maximum playtime that the Red Book ( audio CD standard ) specifies for a digital audio CD ( CD - DA ) ; although now , most recordable CDs can hold 80 minutes worth of data . The DVD and Blu - ray discs hold a higher capacity of data , so reading or writing those discs in the same 74 - minute time - frame requires a higher data transfer rate .
