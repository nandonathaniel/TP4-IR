Most volcanic rocks share a number of common minerals . Differentiation of volcanic rocks tends to increase the silica ( SiO ) content mainly by fractional crystallization . Thus , more evolved volcanic rocks tend to be richer in minerals with a higher amount if silica such as phyllo and tectosilicates including the feldspars , quartz polymorphs and muscovite . While still dominated by silicates , more primitive volcanic rocks have mineral assemblages with less silica , such as olivine and the pyroxenes . Bowen 's reaction series correctly predicts the order of formation of the most common minerals in volcanic rocks .
