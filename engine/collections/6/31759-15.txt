Formal race meetings began to be instigated too . It is believed that the first occurrence of a trophy being presented to the winner of a race was in 1512 by organisers of a fair in Chester and was a small wooden ball decorated with flowers . Meanwhile , the oldest horse race still in existence , the Kiplingcotes Derby was first run in 1519 . The Carlisle Bells , reputedly the oldest sporting trophy in the world , were first competed for in the 16th century , in a race that still bears their name . One of the bells is inscribed `` The sweftes horse thes bel tak '' ( `` The swiftest horse takes this bell '' ) .
