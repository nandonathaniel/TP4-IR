Sovereignty over two separated pieces of territory have been contested between China and India . Aksai Chin is located either in the Indian province of Jammu and Kashmir , or the Chinese province of Xinjiang , in the west . It is a virtually uninhabited high - altitude wasteland crossed by the Xinjiang - Tibet Highway . The other disputed territory lies south of other McMahon Line . It was formerly referred to as the North East Frontier Agency , and is now called Arunachal Pradesh . The McMahon Line was part of the 1914 Simla Convention between British India and Tibet , an agreement rejected by China .
