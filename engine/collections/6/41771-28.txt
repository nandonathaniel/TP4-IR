The principle of effective occupation stated that powers could acquire rights over colonial lands only if they possessed them or had `` effective occupation '' : in other words , if they had treaties with local leaders , if they flew their flag there , and if they established an administration in the territory to govern it with a police force to keep order . The colonial power could also make use of the colony economically . This principle became important not only as a basis for the European powers to acquire territorial sovereignty in Africa , but also for determining the limits of their respective overseas possessions , as effective occupation served in some instances as a criterion for settling disputes over the boundaries between colonies . But , as the Berlin Act was limited in its scope to the lands that fronted on the African coast , European powers in numerous instances later claimed rights over lands in the interior without demonstrating the requirement of effective occupation , as articulated in Article 35 of the Final Act .
