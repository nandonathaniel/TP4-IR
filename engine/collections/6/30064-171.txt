Science museums traditionally emphasize cultural heritage through objects of intrinsic value , echoes of the ' curiosity cabinets ' of the Renaissance period . These early museums of science represented a fascination with collecting which emerged in the fifteenth century from ' an attempt to manage the empirical explosion of materials that wider dissemination of ancient texts , increased travel , voyages of discovery , and more systematic forms of communication and exchange had produced . Science museums were institutions of authoritative , uncontestable , knowledge , places of ' collecting , seeing and knowing , places where `` anybody '' might come and survey the evidence of science . Dinosaurs , extensive invertebrate and vertebrate collections , plant taxonomies , and so on - these were the orders of the day . By the nineteenth century , science museums had flourished , and with it ' the capacity of exhibitionary representation to render the world as visible and ordered ... part of the instantiation of wider senses of scientific and political certainty ' ( MacDonald , 1998 : 11 ) . By the twentieth century , museums of science had built ' on their earlier emphasis on public education to present themselves as experts in the mediation between the obscure world of science and that of the public .
