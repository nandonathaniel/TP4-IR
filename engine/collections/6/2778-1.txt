Before the 1970 merger between the American Football League ( AFL ) and the National Football League ( NFL ) , the two leagues met in four such contests . The first two were known as the `` AFL -- NFL World Championship Game '' . Super Bowl III in January 1969 was the first such game that carried the `` Super Bowl '' moniker , the names `` Super Bowl I '' and `` Super Bowl II '' were only retroactively applied to the first two games . The NFC / NFL leads in Super Bowl wins with 26 , while the AFC / AFL has won 25 . Nineteen different franchises , including teams that relocated to another city , have won the Super Bowl .
