G is a resting phase where the cell has left the cycle and has stopped dividing . The cell cycle starts with this phase . The word `` post-mitotic '' is sometimes used to refer to both quiescent and senescent cells . Non-proliferative ( non-dividing ) cells in multicellular eukaryotes generally enter the quiescent G state from G and may remain quiescent for long periods of time , possibly indefinitely ( as is often the case for neurons ) . This is very common for cells that are fully differentiated . Cellular senescence occurs in response to DNA damage and external stress and usually constitutes an arrest in G. Some cells enter the G phase semi-permanently and are considered post-mitotic , e.g. , some liver , kidney , and stomach cells . Many cells do not enter G and continue to divide throughout an organism 's life , e.g. , epithelial cells .
