How the word `` chocolate '' came into Spanish is not certain . The authority on the Spanish language , the Royal Spanish Academy , derives it from the Nahuatl word `` xocolatl '' ( pronounced ( ʃoˈkolaːtɬ ) ) made up from the words `` xococ '' meaning sour or bitter , and `` atl '' meaning water or drink . However , as William Bright noted the word `` chocolatl '' does n't occur in central Mexican colonial sources making this an unlikely derivation . Santamaria gives a derivation from the Yucatec Maya word `` chokol '' meaning hot , and the Nahuatl `` atl '' meaning water . More recently Dakin and Wichman derive it from another Nahuatl term , `` chicolatl '' from Eastern Nahuatl meaning `` beaten drink '' . They derive this term from the word for the frothing stick , `` chicoli '' . The word xocoatl means beverage of maize . The words `` cacaua atl '' mean drink of cacao . The word `` xocolatl '' does not appear in Molina 's dictionary .
