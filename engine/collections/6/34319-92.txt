Mussolini sent a warship to shell the Greek island of Corfu , and Italian forces occupied the island on 31 August 1923 . This contravened the League 's covenant , so Greece appealed to the League to deal with the situation . The Allies agreed ( at Mussolini 's insistence ) that the Conference of Ambassadors should be responsible for resolving the dispute because it was the conference that had appointed General Tellini . The League Council examined the dispute , but then passed on their findings to the Conference of Ambassadors to make the final decision . The conference accepted most of the League 's recommendations , forcing Greece to pay fifty million lire to Italy , even though those who committed the crime were never discovered . Italian forces then withdrew from Corfu .
