This principle maintains that when the human mind ( perceptual system ) forms a percept or `` gestalt '' , the whole has a reality of its own , independent of the parts . The original famous phrase of Gestalt psychologist Kurt Koffka , `` the whole is something else than the sum of its parts '' is often incorrectly translated as `` The whole is greater than the sum of its parts '' , and thus used when explaining gestalt theory , and further incorrectly applied to systems theory . Koffka did not like the translation . He firmly corrected students who replaced `` other '' with `` greater '' . `` This is not a principle of addition '' he said . The whole has an independent existence .
