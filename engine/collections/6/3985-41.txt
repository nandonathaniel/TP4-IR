This verse has caused some to ask if meat should be eaten in the summer . Meat has more calories than fruits and vegetables , which some individuals may need fewer of in summer than winter . Also , before fruits and vegetables could be preserved , people often did not have enough other food to eat in winter . Spoiled meat can be fatal if eaten , and in former times meat spoiled more readily in summer than winter . Modern methods of refrigeration now make it possible to preserve meat in any season . The key word with respect to the use of meat is sparingly .
