The device was of the implosion - type design and had a close resemblance to the American nuclear bomb called the Fat Man . The implosion system was assembled at the Terminal Ballistics Research Laboratory ( TBRL ) of the DRDO in Chandigarh . The detonation system was developed at the High Energy Materials Research Laboratory ( HEMRL ) of the DRDO in Pune , Maharashtra State . The 6 kg of plutonium came from the CIRUS reactor at BARC . The neutron initiator was of the polonium -- beryllium type and code - named Flower . The complete nuclear bomb was engineered and finally assembled by Indian engineers at Trombay before transportation to the test site .
