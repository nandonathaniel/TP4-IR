During most of the 19th century , Ashanti , the most powerful state of the Akan interior , sought to expand its rule and to promote and protect its trade . The first Ashanti invasion of the coastal regions took place in 1807 ; the Ashanti moved south again in 1811 and in 1814 . These invasions , though not decisive , disrupted trade in such products as gold , timber , and palm oil , and threatened the security of the European forts . Local British , Dutch , and Danish authorities were all forced to come to terms with Ashanti , and in 1817 the African Company of Merchants signed a treaty of friendship that recognized Ashanti claims to sovereignty over large areas of the coast and its peoples .
