Diethylaminoethyl cellulose ( DEAE - C ) is a positively charged resin used in ion - exchange chromatography , a type of column chromatography , for the separation and purification of proteins and nucleic acids . Gel matrix beads are derivatized with diethylaminoethanol ( DEAE ) and lock negatively charged proteins or nucleic acids into the matrix . The proteins are released from the resin by increasing the salt concentration of the solvent or changing the pH of the solution as to change the charge on the protein .
