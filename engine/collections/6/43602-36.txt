Hearings . When a subcommittee selects a bill ( or several bills on the same subject ) for serious attention , it usually begins by conducting public hearings on one or more days at which executive branch officials , other Members of Congress , representatives of private organizations , and even individual citizens present their views on the bill 's merits . CRS analysts can assist in this process by providing background information and reports , presenting a preliminary briefing to Members or staff , identifying potential witnesses , and suggesting questions that Members may consider asking the witnesses .
