A force of 2,500 soldiers under General Ross had just arrived in Bermuda aboard HMS Royal Oak , three frigates , three sloops and ten other vessels .

In response to Pr√©vost 's request , they decided to employ this force , together with the naval and military units already on the station , to strike at the `` Federal City '' of Washington , D.C.
