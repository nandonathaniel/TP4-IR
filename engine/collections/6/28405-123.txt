The Gander Air Base ( RCAF Station Gander ) located at Gander International Airport built in 1936 in Newfoundland was leased by Britain to Canada for 99 years because of its urgent need for the movement of fighter and bomber aircraft to Britain . The lease became redundant when Newfoundland became Canada 's tenth province in 1949 .
