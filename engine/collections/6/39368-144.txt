According to those who critique the ecological awareness and similar theories , Chipko had nothing to do with protecting forests , rather it was an economic struggle using the traditional Indian way of non-violence . These scientists point out that very little is left of the Chipko movements today in its region of origin save for its memory , even though the quality of forests and its use remains a critical issue for India . To explain the cause of Chipko movement , they find that government officials had ignored the subsistence issues of the local communities , who depended on forests for fuel , fodder , fertiliser and sustenance resources . These researchers claim that local interviews and fact finding confirms that local communities had filed complaints requesting the right to commercially exploit the forests around them . Their requests were denied , while permits to fell trees and exploit those same forests were granted to government - favoured non-resident contractors including a sporting company named Symonds . A protest that became Chipko movement followed . The movement grew and Indian government responded by imposing a 15 - year ban on felling all trees above 1000 metres in the region directly as a result of the Chipko agitations . This legislation was deeply resented by many communities supporting Chipko because , the regulation further excluded the local people from the forest around them . Opposition to the legislation resulted in so - called ' Ped Katao Andolan ' in the same region , a movement to cut the trees down in order to defy the new legislation . The people behind Chipko movement felt that the government did not understand or care about their economic situation .
