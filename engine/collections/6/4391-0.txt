Phototropism is the growth of an organism which responds to a light stimulus . It is most often observed in plants , but can also occur in other organisms such as fungi . The cells on the plant that are farthest from the light have a chemical called auxin that reacts when phototropism occurs . This causes the plant to have elongated cells on the farthest side from the light . Phototropism is one of the many plant tropisms or movements which respond to external stimuli . Growth towards a light source is called positive phototropism , while growth away from light is called negative phototropism ( skototropism ) . Most plant shoots exhibit positive phototropism , and rearrange their chloroplasts in the leaves to maximize photosynthetic energy and promote growth . Roots usually exhibit negative phototropism , although gravitropism may play a larger role in root behavior and growth . Some vine shoot tips exhibit negative phototropism , which allows them to grow towards dark , solid objects and climb them . The combination of phototropism and gravitropism allow plants to grow in the correct direction .
