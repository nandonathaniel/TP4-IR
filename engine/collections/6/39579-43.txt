The first location that the producers agreed on was Lacock in Wiltshire to represent the village of Meryton . Luckington Court nearby served as the interior and exterior of Longbourn . Lyme Hall in Cheshire was chosen as Pemberley but management problems forced production to film Pemberley 's interiors at Sudbury Hall in Sudbury , Derbyshire .
