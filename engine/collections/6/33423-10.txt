The song is closely associated with the Grateful Dead ; a studio version appeared on their first album The Grateful Dead ( 1967 ) , and the song was a standard part of the Dead 's repertoire throughout their career . They would often open with the song , or perform it early in the first set . Unlike Chandler 's recording , in the Dead 's version of the lyrics the husband generally laments his mistreatment at his greedy wife 's hands , but does not kill her . The lyrics from the Grateful Dead 's version were adapted from an earlier recording by Obray Ramsey .
