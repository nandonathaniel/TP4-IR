Gen. Hooker was replaced by Maj. Gen. George Meade during Lee 's second invasion of the North , in June . Meade defeated Lee at the Battle of Gettysburg ( July 1 to 3 , 1863 ) . This was the bloodiest battle of the war , and has been called the war 's turning point . Pickett 's Charge on July 3 is often considered the high - water mark of the Confederacy because it signaled the collapse of serious Confederate threats of victory . Lee 's army suffered 28,000 casualties ( versus Meade 's 23,000 ) . However , Lincoln was angry that Meade failed to intercept Lee 's retreat .
