In the Netherlands , Belgium , the United Kingdom , Spain , Poland , Hungary , Slovenia , the Czech Republic , and Macedonia a relatively new type of two - lane roundabout designs is emerging , called turbo roundabouts . These designs require motorists to choose their direction before entering the roundabout , thereby eliminating many conflicting paths and choices on the roundabout itself , such that traffic safety is increased , as well as speed and capacity . These designs , seen from above , typically result in a spiralling flow of traffic , giving them the collective name of turbo roundabouts . As a minor drawback turbo roundabouts are often marked out such that a U-turn by means of the roundabout is not possible for drivers approaching on certain arms . Several variations of turbo roundabouts exist . They are frequently designed for the intersection of a major road crossing a road with less traffic .
