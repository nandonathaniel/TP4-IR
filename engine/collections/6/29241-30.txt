The climate and environment of the Florida Keys are closer to that of the Caribbean than the rest of Florida , though unlike the Caribbean 's volcanic islands , the Keys were built by plants and animals . The Upper Keys islands are composed of sandy - type accumulations of limestone grains produced by plants and marine organisms . The Lower Keys are the remnants of large coral reefs , which became fossilized and exposed as sea level declined .
