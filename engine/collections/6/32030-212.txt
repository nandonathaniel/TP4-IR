Israel 's diverse culture stems from the diversity of its population : Jews from diaspora communities around the world have brought their cultural and religious traditions back with them , creating a melting pot of Jewish customs and beliefs . Israel is the only country in the world where life revolves around the Hebrew calendar . Work and school holidays are determined by the Jewish holidays , and the official day of rest is Saturday , the Jewish Sabbath . Israel 's substantial Arab minority has also left its imprint on Israeli culture in such spheres as architecture , music , and cuisine .
