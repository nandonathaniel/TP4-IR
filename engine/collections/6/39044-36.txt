Temporary resident permits are a one - time authorization for someone who is otherwise criminally inadmissible to enter Canada . Permits are rarely granted without cause , typically only in extenuating circumstances ( such as a documented family emergency ) , on significant humanitarian grounds ( such as sponsoring an inadmissible spouse or child ) , or for reasons of Canadian national interest , or in circumstances where the reasons for criminal inadmissibility are negligible . TRP 's are usually issued with varying restrictions and can be revoked if deemed necessary . Temporary resident permits can , however , be obtained by an individual who has a criminal record if it can be proven that he has been rehabilitated and is able to demonstrate that the need for him to enter Canada outweighs any risk that he may cause to Canada.
