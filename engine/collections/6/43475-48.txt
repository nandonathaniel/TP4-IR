Chizuru and Ryuu are back on good terms and everyone is eagerly anticipating Christmas . Their class is going to hold a party and Kazehaya asks Sawako to come . She really wants to , but thinks of her parents . Traditionally , her family spends all day celebrating , so she would feel bad about leaving them . She decides not to go to the party , but makes gifts for Chizuru and Ayane . She also makes a hat for Kazehaya , though she knows she wo n't have the nerve to give it to him . On Christmas Eve , she spends the day with her parents . Her dad is especially enthusiastic and ends up taking the hat Sawako made , thinking it was for him . She does n't have the heart to correct him . Later that night , she gets a call from her friends at the party asking her to come . She becomes very distraught , so her mom takes the call instead . Her dad calls her over and gives her his present for her - a cellphone . He lets her go to the party and realizes she is growing up . Sawako runs there , but everyone has left . Only Kazehaya has been waiting for her out in the snow .
