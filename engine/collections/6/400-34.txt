The French Marquise de Créquy wrote in her Souvenirs that the words `` Grand Dieu , sauvez le Roi ! '' were indeed composed by Jean - Baptiste Lully in gratitude for the survival by Louis XIV of an anal fistula operation . ( The surgical knife purpose - made for the occasion is on display in the Musée d'histoire de la médecine . ) Allegedly , Lully had set words by Marie de Brinon to music , and Créquy claimed that the tune was later plagiarised by Handel , and so adopted by the British as `` un de leurs air nationaux '' . ( The entire story might have been intended as a joke . ) Translated into Latin under the title Domine , Salvum Fac Regem , it became the French anthem until 1792 . After the Battle of Culloden , the Hanover dynasty supposedly adopted this melody as the British anthem .
