There was also a notable group of war poets who wrote about their own experiences of war , which caught the public attention . Some died on active service , most famously Rupert Brooke , Isaac Rosenberg , and Wilfred Owen , while some , such as Siegfried Sassoon survived . Themes of the poems included the youth ( or naivety ) of the soldiers , and the dignified manner in which they fought and died . This is evident in lines such as `` They fell with their faces to the foe '' , from the `` Ode of Remembrance '' taken from Laurence Binyon 's For the Fallen , which was first published in The Times in September 1914 . Female poets such as Vera Brittain also wrote from the home front , to lament the losses of brothers and lovers fighting on the front .
