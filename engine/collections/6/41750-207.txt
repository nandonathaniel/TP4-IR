General Foch pressed to use the arriving American troops as individual replacements , whereas Pershing sought to field American units as an independent force . These units were assigned to the depleted French and British Empire commands on 28 March . A Supreme War Council of Allied forces was created at the Doullens Conference on 5 November 1917 . General Foch was appointed as supreme commander of the Allied forces . Haig , Petain , and Pershing retained tactical control of their respective armies ; Foch assumed a coordinating rather than a directing role , and the British , French , and U.S. commands operated largely independently .
