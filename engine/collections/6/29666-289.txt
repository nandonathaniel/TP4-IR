Alan Greenspan argues that the very existence of antitrust laws discourages businessmen from some activities that might be socially useful out of fear that their business actions will be determined illegal and dismantled by government . In his essay entitled Antitrust , he says : `` No one will ever know what new products , processes , machines , and cost - saving mergers failed to come into existence , killed by the Sherman Act before they were born . No one can ever compute the price that all of us have paid for that Act which , by inducing less effective use of capital , has kept our standard of living lower than would otherwise have been possible . '' Those , like Greenspan , who oppose antitrust tend not to support competition as an end in itself but for its results -- low prices . As long as a monopoly is not a coercive monopoly where a firm is securely insulated from potential competition , it is argued that the firm must keep prices low in order to discourage competition from arising . Hence , legal action is uncalled for and wrongly harms the firm and consumers .
