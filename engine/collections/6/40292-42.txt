In 1225 , the street performer and juggler Bertrand Cordel , doubtlessly encouraged by local lords , tried to pass himself off as Baldwin I of Constantinople ( the father of Jeanne of Flanders ) , who had disappeared at the battle of Adrianople . He pushed the kingdoms of Flanders and Hainaut towards sedition against Jeanne in order to recover his land . She called her cousin , Louis VIII ( `` The Lion '' ) . He unmasked the imposter , whom Countess Jeanne quickly had hanged . In 1226 the King agreed to free Infante Ferdinand , Count of Flanders . Count Ferrand died in 1233 , and his daughter Marie soon after . In 1235 , Jeanne granted a city charter by which city governors would be chosen each All Saint 's Day by four commissioners chosen by the ruler . On 6 February 1236 , she founded the Countess 's Hospital ( Hospice Comtesse ) , which remains one of the most beautiful buildings in Old Lille . It was in her honour that the hospital of the Regional Medical University of Lille was named `` Jeanne of Flanders Hospital '' in the 20th century .
