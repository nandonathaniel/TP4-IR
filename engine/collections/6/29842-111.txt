The Great Depression hit Italy very hard . As industries came close to failure they were bought out by the banks in a largely illusionary bail - out -- the assets used to fund the purchases were largely worthless . This led to a financial crisis peaking in 1932 and major government intervention . The Industrial Reconstruction Institute ( IRI ) was formed in January 1933 and took control of the bank - owned companies , suddenly giving Italy the largest state - owned industrial sector in Europe ( excluding the USSR ) . IRI did rather well with its new responsibilities -- restructuring , modernising and rationalising as much as it could . It was a significant factor in post-1945 development . But it took the Italian economy until 1935 to recover the manufacturing levels of 1930 -- a position that was only 60 % better than that of 1913 .
