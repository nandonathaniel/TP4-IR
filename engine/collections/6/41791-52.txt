Axolemma : The specialized plasma membrane on the axons of nerve cells that is responsible for the generation of the action potential . It consists of a granular , densely packed lipid bilayer that works closely with the cytoskeleton components spectrin and actin . These cytoskeleton components are able to bind to and interact with transmembrane proteins in the axolemma .
