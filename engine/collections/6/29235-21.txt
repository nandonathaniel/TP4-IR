The belief that hockey was mentioned in a 1363 proclamation by King Edward III of England is based on modern translations of the proclamation , which was originally in Latin and explicitly forbade the games `` Pilam Manualem , Pedivam , & Bacularem : & ad Canibucam & Gallorum Pugnam '' . The English historian and biographer John Strype did not use the word `` hockey '' when he translated the proclamation in 1720 .
