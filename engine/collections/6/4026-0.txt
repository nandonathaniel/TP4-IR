It represents a formal agreement to future marriage . In Western countries , engagement rings are worn mostly by women , and rings can feature diamonds or other gemstones . In some cultures men and women wear matching rings , and engagement rings may also be used as wedding rings . In Anglo - Saxon countries , the ring is customarily worn on the left hand ring finger , but customs vary considerably elsewhere across the world .
