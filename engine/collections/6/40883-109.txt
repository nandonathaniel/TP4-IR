The United States had permitted the execution and life imprisonment of juvenile offenders , in contravention of the Article 37 of the Convention . In 2005 , a Supreme Court decision declared juvenile executions to be unconstitutional as `` cruel and unusual punishment '' ; in 2012 , the Court held that mandatory sentences of life without the possibility of parole are unconstitutional for juvenile offenders .
