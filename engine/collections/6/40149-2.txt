The Internet has expanded the variety and amount of accessible political information . On the positive side , this may create a more pluralistic form of public debate ; on the negative side , greater access to information may lead to selective exposure to ideologically supportive channels . In an extreme `` echo chamber '' , one purveyor of information will make a claim , which many like - minded people then repeat , overhear , and repeat again ( often in an exaggerated or otherwise distorted form ) until most people assume that some extreme variation of the story is true .
