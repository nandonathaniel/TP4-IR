The Board of Punishments handled all legal matters , including the supervision of various law courts and prisons . The Qing legal framework was relatively weak compared to modern day legal systems , as there was no separation of executive and legislative branches of government . The legal system could be inconsistent , and , at times , arbitrary , because the emperor ruled by decree and had final say on all judicial outcomes . Emperors could ( and did ) overturn judgements of lower courts from time to time . Fairness of treatment was also an issue under the system of control practised by the Manchu government over the Han Chinese majority . To counter these inadequacies and keep the population in line , the Qing government maintained a very harsh penal code towards the Han populace , but it was no more severe than previous Chinese dynasties .
