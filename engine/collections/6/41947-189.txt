Each state in Australia has different rules for how long a visitor can drive on an international licence or a licence from a different state . For example , New South Wales allows three months whereas Victoria allows six months . Drivers that move permanently to another state must change their licence to a local state licence within the prescribed time . This is usually free . In some states , drivers with a full New Zealand licence are treated as interstate drivers .
