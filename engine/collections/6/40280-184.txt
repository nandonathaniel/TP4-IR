The Senate tends to be less partisan and confrontational than the Commons and is more likely to come to a consensus on issues . It also often has more opportunity to study proposed bills in detail either as a whole or in committees . This careful review process is why the Senate is still today called the chamber of `` sober second thought '' , though the term has a slightly different meaning than it did when used by John A. Macdonald . The format of the Senate allows it to make many small improvements to legislation before its final reading .
