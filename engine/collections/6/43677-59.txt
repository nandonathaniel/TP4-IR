However , the application of standardized Piagetian theory and procedures in different societies established widely varying results that lead some to speculate not only that some cultures produce more cognitive development than others but that without specific kinds of cultural experience , but also formal schooling , development might cease at certain level , such as concrete operational level . A procedure was done following methods developed in Geneva ( i.e. water level task ) . Participants were presented with two beakers of equal circumference and height , filled with equal amounts of water . The water from one beaker was transferred into another with taller and smaller circumference . The children and young adults from non-literate societies of a given age were more likely to think that the taller , thinner beaker had more water in it . On the other hand , an experiment on the effects of modifying testing procedures to match local cultural produced a different pattern of results . In the revised procedures , the participants explained in their own language and indicated that while the water was now `` more '' , the quantity was the same . Piaget 's water level task has also been applied to the elderly by Formann and results showed an age - associated non-linear decline of performance .
