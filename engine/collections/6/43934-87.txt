Biofuels include a wide range of fuels which are derived from biomass . The term covers solid , liquid , and gaseous fuels . Liquid biofuels include bioalcohols , such as bioethanol , and oils , such as biodiesel . Gaseous biofuels include biogas , landfill gas and synthetic gas . Bioethanol is an alcohol made by fermenting the sugar components of plant materials and it is made mostly from sugar and starch crops . These include maize , sugarcane and , more recently , sweet sorghum . The latter crop is particularly suitable for growing in dryland conditions , and is being investigated by International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics for its potential to provide fuel , along with food and animal feed , in arid parts of Asia and Africa .
