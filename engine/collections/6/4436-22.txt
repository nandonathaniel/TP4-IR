One of their kings tried to make a canal to it ( for it would have been of no little advantage to them for the whole region to have become navigable ; Sesostris is said to have been the first of the ancient kings to try ) , but he found that the sea was higher than the land . So he first , and Darius afterwards , stopped making the canal , lest the sea should mix with the river water and spoil it .
