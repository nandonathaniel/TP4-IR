The election of 1800 was the topic of the song ' The Election of 1800 ' from the Broadway musical Hamilton . In the song ' Hamilton ' says `` I have never agreed with Jefferson once , we have fought on 75 different fronts , but when all is said and all is done : Jefferson has beliefs . Burr has none . '' This angers Burr and leads directly into the song ' Your Obedient Servant ' : in which Burr stands up to Hamilton and declares a duel . This duel led to the death of Alexander Hamilton . The election 's story and the eventual reconciliation between Jefferson and Adams was also retold in a second season episode of Comedy Central 's Drunk History , with Jerry O'Connell portraying Jefferson and Joe Lo Truglio as Adams .
