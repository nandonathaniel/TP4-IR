I do have the original tape that was running at the time we ran down `` Stairway To Heaven '' completely with the band . I 'd worked it all out already the night before with John Paul Jones , written down the changes and things . All this time we were all living in a house and keeping pretty regular hours together , so the next day we started running it down . There was only one place where there was a slight rerun . For some unknown reason Bonzo could n't get the timing right on the twelve - string part before the solo . Other than that it flowed very quickly .
