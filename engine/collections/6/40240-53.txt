As a result of immigration to the United States and the incorporation of non-English speaking people into the country , the lyrics of the song have been translated into other languages . In 1861 , it was translated into German . The Library of Congress also has record of a Spanish - language version from 1919 . It has since been translated into Hebrew and Yiddish by Jewish immigrants , Latin American Spanish ( with one version popularized during immigration reform protests in 2006 ) , French by Acadians of Louisiana , Samoan , and Irish . The third verse of the anthem has also been translated into Latin .
