Because of the loss of key players such as Barry , Wilkes and Thurmond to trades and retirements , the Warriors struggled to put a competitive team on the court from 1978 to 1987 after being one of the NBA 's dominant teams in the 1960s and most of the 1970s . Through the NBA draft , however , they acquired some players such as high - scoring forward Purvis Short ( 1978 ) , former Purdue center Joe Barry Carroll ( 1980 ) and center Robert Parish ( 1976 ) , who was traded to the Boston Celtics in 1980 along with the draft pick that would become Kevin McHale for the pick used to draft Carroll . In 1983 , the Warriors matched the New York Knicks ' offer for free - agent Bernard King , but , unable to pay his high salary , quickly traded him to the Knicks for guard Micheal Ray Richardson , whom they soon shipped to New Jersey in exchange for former Georgetown Hoya point guard Eric `` Sleepy '' Floyd , and journeyman forward Mickey Johnson . ( Floyd once scored 29 points for the Warriors in the fourth quarter of a playoff game against the Lakers , though he was later traded to the Houston Rockets ) .
