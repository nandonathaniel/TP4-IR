Derek Wilton was axed by producer Brian Park in a high - profile cull in 1997 . His axing was said to have caused his co-worker Thelma Barlow ( who played his on - screen wife Mavis ) to quit her role in the show . While appearing on ITVs This Morning in October 2010 , Barlow denied it was the reason she left the show , stating she had decided to quit before Baldwin was axed .
