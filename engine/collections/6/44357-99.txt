The vice presidency was established primarily to provide a successor in the event of the president 's death , disability , or resignation . Vice presidents have two constitutionally mandated duties : to serve as President of the Senate ( but without a vote , unless the Senate is evenly divided ) , and to receive from the states the tally of electoral ballots cast for president and vice president and to open the certificates during a joint session of Congress . Other statutorily granted roles include membership of both the National Security Council and the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution .
