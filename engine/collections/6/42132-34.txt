The term `` peacemakers '' has traditionally been interpreted to mean not only those who live in peace with others , but also those who do their best to promote friendship among mankind and between God and man . St. Gregory of Nyssa interpreted it as `` Godly work '' , which was an imitation of God 's love of man . John Wesley said the peacemakers ' endeavour to calm the stormy spirits of men , to quiet their turbulent passions , to soften the minds of contending parties , and , if possible , reconcile them to each other . They use all innocent arts , and employ all their strength , all the talents which God has given them , as well to preserve peace where it is , as to restore it where it is not . '
