There is an endeavor in some contemporary occult and esoteric circles to reinvent shamanism in a modern form , often drawing from core shamanism -- a set of beliefs and practices synthesized by Michael Harner -- centered on the use of ritual drumming and dance , and Harner 's interpretations of various indigenous religions . Harner has faced criticism for taking pieces of diverse religions out of their cultural contexts and synthesising a set of universal shamanic techniques . Some neoshamans focus on the ritual use of entheogens , and also embrace the philosophies of chaos magic while others ( such as Jan Fries ) have created their own forms of shamanism .
