Advocates of Pauline authorship defend the differences that there are between elements in this letter and those commonly considered the genuine work of Paul ( e.g. 1 Thessalonians ) . It is argued that these differences can come by human variability , such as by growth in theological knowledge over time , different occasion for writing , as well as use of different secretaries ( or amanuensis ) in composition . As it is usually pointed out by the same authors who note the differences in language and style , the number of words foreign to the New Testament and Paul is no greater in Colossians than in the undisputed Pauline letters ( Galatians , of similar length , has 35 hapax legomena ) . In regard to the style , as Norman Perrin , who argues for pseudonymity , notes , `` The letter does employ a great deal of traditional material and it can be argued that this accounts for the non-Pauline language and style . If this is the case , the non-Pauline language and style are not indications of pseudonymity . '' Not only that , but it has been noted that Colossians has indisputably Pauline stylistic characteristics , found nowhere else in the New Testament . Advocates of Pauline authorship also argue that the differences between Colossians and the rest of the New Testament are not as great as they are purported to be .
