In a less enthusiastic critique , Jon Caramanica of The New York Times likened `` Diamonds '' to a James Bond movie theme song , but with `` insipid lyrics '' . Jim Farber of the New York Daily News felt that the song is not as evocative as it attempts to be and lacks the sense of mystery and engaging production found on `` We Found Love '' . Kevin Blair of the Irish Independent 's , Independent Woman , was critical of the song for deviating from Rihanna 's previous dance and R&B songs and dismissed it as a `` chugging , faintly misty - eyed , middle of the road pop song '' . Chris Richards of The Washington Post panned the song as a `` power ballad without much power '' .
