Obstructing the field is one of the nine methods of dismissing a batsman in the sport of cricket . It dictates that either batsman can be given out if he wilfully attempts to obstruct or distract the fielding side by word or action . It is governed by Law 37 of the laws of cricket , and is a rare way for a batsman to be dismissed : in the history of cricket , there have been only one instance in Test matches , six occasions in One Day International ( ODI ) games , and only one instance in Twenty20 International matches . However , there have also been seven instances in Test cricket , and two in ODIs , where a batsman has been dismissed handled the ball , a mode of dismissal now folded into obstructing the field . In most cases an obstruction occurs when a batsman thinks that he is going to be run out and he blocks the ball with his bat or changes his course while running between wickets to block the ball . The obstruction has to be deliberate , so a batsman will not be out if the contact with the ball is inadvertent .
