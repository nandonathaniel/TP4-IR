On 19 May , 42,000 Ottoman troops launched an attack at Anzac to push the 17,000 Australians and New Zealanders back into the sea . Short of artillery and ammunition , the Ottomans intended to rely on surprise and weight of numbers but on 18 May , the crews of a flight of British aircraft spotted the Ottoman preparations . The Ottomans suffered c. 13,000 casualties in the attack , of which 3,000 men were killed ; Australian and New Zealand casualties were 160 killed and 468 wounded . The dead included a stretcher bearer , John Simpson Kirkpatrick , whose efforts to evacuate wounded men on a donkey while under fire became famous amongst the Australians at Anzac ; afterwards , his story becoming part of the Australian narrative of the campaign . Ottoman losses were so severe that a truce was organised by Aubrey Herbert and others on 24 May , to bury the dead lying in no man 's land , which led to a camaraderie between the armies , much like the Christmas truce of 1914 on the Western Front . The truce was not repeated formally .
