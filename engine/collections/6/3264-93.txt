Pocahontas received generally mixed reviews from film critics . Roger Ebert , writing for the Chicago Sun - Times , gave the film 3 out of 4 stars writing the film was `` the best - looking of the modern Disney animated features , and one of the more thoughtful '' though in his print review , he was more critical of the story and portrayal of the villain ultimately summarizing that `` on a list including Mermaid , Beauty , Aladdin and Lion King , I 'd rank it fifth . It has a lot of good intentions , but a severe scoundrel shortage . '' On the television program Siskel & Ebert , Ebert repeated the same sentiment , while his partner Gene Siskel was more praising of the film . Both critics gave the film a `` Thumbs Up '' . In his print review for the Chicago Tribune , Siskel awarded the film 31‚ÅÑ2 stars out of 4 commenting that the film is a `` surprisingly serious , thoughtful and beautifully drawn Disney animated feature about the American birthright of exploitation and racism '' . He praised it for `` sending powerful images to children about threats to the natural order '' , restoring `` a certain majesty to the Indian culture '' , and for having `` the courage that leads to the life - goes - on ending .
