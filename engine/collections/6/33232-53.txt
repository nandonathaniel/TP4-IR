An egg hunt is a game in which decorated eggs , which may be hard - boiled chicken eggs , chocolate eggs , or artificial eggs containing candies , are hidden for children to find . The eggs often vary in size , and may be hidden both indoors and outdoors . When the hunt is over , prizes may be given for the largest number of eggs collected , or for the largest or the smallest egg .
