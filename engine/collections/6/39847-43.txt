Europe around the 16th century was changing quickly . The new world had just been opened up , overseas trade and plunder was pouring wealth through the international economy and attitudes among businessmen were shifting . In 1561 a system of Industrial Monopoly Licenses , similar to modern patents had been introduced into England . But by the reign of Queen Elizabeth I , the system was reputedly much abused and used merely to preserve privileges , encouraging nothing new in the way of innovation or manufacture . In response English courts developed case law on restrictive business practices . The statute followed the unanimous decision in Darcy v. Allein 1602 , also known as the Case of Monopolies , of the King 's bench to declare void the sole right that Queen Elizabeth I had granted to Darcy to import playing cards into England . Darcy , an officer of the Queen 's household , claimed damages for the defendant 's infringement of this right . The court found the grant void and that three characteristics of monopoly were ( 1 ) price increases , ( 2 ) quality decrease , ( 3 ) the tendency to reduce artificers to idleness and beggary . This put an end to granted monopolies until King James I began to grant them again . In 1623 Parliament passed the Statute of Monopolies , which for the most part excluded patent rights from its prohibitions , as well as guilds . From King Charles I , through the civil war and to King Charles II , monopolies continued , especially useful for raising revenue . Then in 1684 , in East India Company v. Sandys it was decided that exclusive rights to trade only outside the realm were legitimate , on the grounds that only large and powerful concerns could trade in the conditions prevailing overseas .
