Unlike other states , rent , medical services and perishable foods are subject to the excise tax . Also , unlike other states , businesses are not required to show the tax separately on the receipt , as it is technically part of the selling price . Most retail businesses in Hawaii , however , do list the tax as a separate line item. 4.0 % is charged at retail with an additional 0.5 % surcharge in the City and County of Honolulu ( for a total of 4.5 % on Oahu sales ) , and 0.5 % is charged on wholesale . However , the state also allows `` tax on tax '' to be charged , which effectively means a customer can be billed as much as 4.166 % ( 4.712 % on Oahu ) . The exact dollar or percentage amount to be added must be quoted to customers within or along with the price . The 0.5 % surcharge on Oahu was implemented to fund the new rail transport system . As with sales tax in other states , nonprofit organizations may apply for an exemption from the tax .
