Thunderstorms , evidenced by flashes of lightning , on Jupiter have been detected and are associated with clouds where water may exist as both a liquid and ice , suggesting a mechanism similar to that on Earth . ( Water is a polar molecule that can carry a charge , so it is capable of creating the charge separation needed to produce lightning . ) These electrical discharges can be up to a thousand times more powerful than lightning on the Earth . The water clouds can form thunderstorms driven by the heat rising from the interior . The clouds of Venus may also be capable of producing lightning ; some observations suggest that the lightning rate is at least half of that on Earth .
