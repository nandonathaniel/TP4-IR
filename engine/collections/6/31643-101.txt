In March 1966 , Ali refused to be inducted into the armed forces . He was systematically denied a boxing license in every state and stripped of his passport . As a result , he did not fight from March 1967 to October 1970 -- from ages 25 to almost 29 -- as his case worked its way through the appeals process before his conviction was overturned in 1971 . During this time of inactivity , as opposition to the Vietnam War began to grow and Ali 's stance gained sympathy , he spoke at colleges across the nation , criticizing the Vietnam War and advocating African American pride and racial justice .
