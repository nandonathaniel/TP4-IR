The Naval Academy received accreditation as an approved `` technological institution '' in 1930 . In 1933 , President Franklin Roosevelt signed into law an act of Congress providing for the Bachelor of Science Degree for the Naval , Military , and Coast Guard Academies . The Class of 1933 was the first to receive this degree and have it written in the diploma . In 1937 , an act of Congress extended to the Superintendent of the Naval Academy the authority to award the Bachelor of Science degree to all living graduates . The Academy later replaced a fixed curriculum taken by all midshipmen with the present core curriculum plus 22 major fields of study .
