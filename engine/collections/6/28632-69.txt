Augustine St. Clare -- Tom 's third owner and father of Eva . St. Clare is complex , often sarcastic , with a ready wit . After a rocky courtship he marries a woman he grows to hold in contempt , though he is too polite to let it show . St. Clare recognizes the evil in chattel slavery but is not willing to relinquish the wealth it brings him . After his daughter 's death he becomes more sincere in his religious thoughts and starts to read the Bible to Tom . He plans on finally taking action against slavery by freeing his slaves , but his good intentions ultimately come to nothing .
