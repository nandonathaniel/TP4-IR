Quincy and Monica are drawn to each other instantly , sharing a love of the game : basketball . Quincy ( played as a youth by Glendon Chattman ) is shocked that a girl could ever love basketball as much as he did , and he is even more shocked when Monica plays so well . Although their first interaction results in Quincy angrily knocking her down during game point and accidentally scarring her face , they share their first kiss on the first day of school and end the `` first quarter '' of the story fighting in the grass .
