In the `` Battle Rounds , '' each coach pairs two of his or her team members to perform together , then chooses one to advance in the competition . In each season , coaches are assisted by celebrity advisors that are different each season . In the first season , coaches sit alongside their respective advisors in the battle stage . However , starting with the second season , the advisors no longer join the coaches in the battle stage . A new element was added in season three ; coaches were given two `` steals '' , allowing each coach to select two individuals who were eliminated during a battle round by another coach .
