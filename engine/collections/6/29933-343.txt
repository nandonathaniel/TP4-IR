Make hay while the sun shines Make love not war Man does not live by bread alone Manners maketh man Many a little makes a mickle Many a mickle makes a muckle Many a true word is spoken in jest Many hands make light work March comes in like a lion and goes out like a lamb Marriages are made in heaven Marry in haste , repent at leisure Memory is the treasure of the mind Men get spoiled by staying , Women get spoiled by wandering Might is right Might makes right Mighty oaks from little acorns grow Milking the bull Misery loves company Moderation in all things Monday 's child is fair of face , Tuesday 's child is full of grace , Wednesday 's child is full of woe , Thursday 's child has far to go , Friday 's child is loving and giving , Saturday 's child works hard for its living , and a child that is born on the Sabbath day is fair and wise and good and gay . Money does not grow on trees Money earned by deceit , goes by deceit Money is not everything Money makes the world go around Money talks Money makes many things , but also makes devil dance More haste , less speed Mud sticks Music has charms to soothe the savage beast
