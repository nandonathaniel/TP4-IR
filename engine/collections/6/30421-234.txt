The Charter of the City of Los Angeles ratified by voters in 1999 created a system of advisory neighborhood councils that would represent the diversity of stakeholders , defined as those who live , work or own property in the neighborhood . The neighborhood councils are relatively autonomous and spontaneous in that they identify their own boundaries , establish their own bylaws , and elect their own officers . There are currently about 90 neighborhood councils .
