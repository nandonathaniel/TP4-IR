Statewide smoking ban : South Dakota voters passed 2009 H.B. 1240 on November 10 , 2010 . The bill bans smoking statewide in all enclosed workplaces in South Dakota , including bars and restaurants , exempting only private residences unless used for child daycare , cigar bars , retail tobacco shops , and a percentage of hotel and motel rooms . The bill was passed in the South Dakota State Legislature and signed into law by Governor Mike Rounds . It was scheduled to take effect in July 2009 , but on June 22 , 2009 , a group of casino and video lottery operators presented the Secretary of State with a petition for a referendum over H.B. 1240 that they claimed to bear 25,000 valid signatures . On June 25 , 2009 , the Secretary of State certified that the petition indeed bore at least the required 16,776 valid signatures , putting H.B. 1240 to the November 2010 public referendum . On July 24 , 2009 , the Secretary of State declared that after further review , the number of valid signatures on the petition fell short of the required number to put the issue on the ballot . On November 13 , 2009 , however , Circuit Judge Kathleen Trandahl ruled that the petition did have enough valid signatures , and ordered the Secretary of State to put the issue to a public vote on November 2 , 2010 , which ultimately passed . H.B. 1240 is silent as to whether local governments may regulate smoking more stringently , though as of November 2010 no local governments in South Dakota have done so .
