In 1804 the Balmis Expedition , an official Spanish mission commanded by Francisco Javier de Balmis , sailed to spread the vaccine throughout the Spanish Empire , first to the Canary Islands and on to Spanish Central America . While his deputy , Jos√© Salvany , took vaccine to the west and east coasts of Spanish South America , Balmis sailed to Manila in the Philippines and on to Canton and Macao on the Chinese coast . He returned to Spain in 1806 .
