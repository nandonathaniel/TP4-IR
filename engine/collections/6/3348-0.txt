Parallax is a displacement or difference in the apparent position of an object viewed along two different lines of sight , and is measured by the angle or semi-angle of inclination between those two lines . The term is derived from Ancient Greek παράλλαξις ( parallaxis ) , meaning ' alternation ' . Due to foreshortening , nearby objects show a larger parallax than farther objects when observed from different positions , so parallax can be used to determine distances .
