A filibuster led by Lewis D. Campbell , an Ohio free - soiler , nearly provoked the House into a war of more than words . Campbell , joined by other antislavery northerners , exchanged insults and invectives with southerners , neither side giving quarter . Weapons were brandished on the floor of the House . Finally , bumptiousness gave way to violence . Henry A. Edmundson , a Virginia Democrat , well oiled and well armed , had to be restrained from making a violent attack on Campbell . Only after the sergeant at arms arrested him , debate was cut off , and the House adjourned did the melee subside .
