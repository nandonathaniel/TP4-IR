For manufacturing solar cells , silicon has relatively low absorptivity for the sunlight meaning about 100 micrometers of Si is needed to absorb most sunlight . Such a layer is relatively robust and easy to handle . In contrast , the absorptivity of GaAs is so high that only a few micrometers of thickness are needed to absorb all of the light . Consequently , GaAs thin films must be supported on a substrate material .
