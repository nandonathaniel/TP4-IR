A second season of The Next Iron Chef pitted ten chefs against one another for the title of Iron Chef beginning in October 2009 . This season ran for eight episodes , during which the contestants competed in culinary challenges held in the United States and Japan . Contestants were eliminated by a panel of judges at the end of each episode until the finale , in which chefs Jehangir Mehta and Jose Garces returned to the United States to compete in Kitchen Stadium . The final battle featured various racks and ribs ( pork , buffalo , and beef ) as the secret ingredient , and was judged by the panel along with Iron Chefs Flay , Morimoto , and Symon . Chef Jose Garces was declared the winner of the competition , and joined Iron Chef America as its newest Iron Chef . Garces made his debut as an Iron Chef on January 17 , 2010 against Seattle chefs Rachel Yang and Seif Chirchi in Battle Hawaiian Moi , with Iron Chef Garces emerging victorious . Jose Garces went on to receive the first perfect score ever in Season 9 ( see List of Episodes ) .
