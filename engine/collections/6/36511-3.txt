The phrase has been used in the Hebrew Bible by Jews ( cf . Numbers 6 : 24 ) , and by Christians , since the time of the early Church as a benediction , as well as a means of bidding a person Godspeed . Many clergy , when blessing their congregants individually or as a group , use the phrase `` God bless you '' .
