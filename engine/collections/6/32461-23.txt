`` The Battle of New Orleans '' is often played during North American sporting events , and is commonly heard during home games of the National Hockey League 's Calgary Flames . Original Horton 45 rpm discs of the song are now worth many times the original cost , partly because the price is inflated . It was regarded with derision in Britain as the British forces withdrew from the battle after heavy losses had put victory out of the question . The British lost 2,036 men , while the Americans under command of future president Andrew Jackson lost only 71 .
