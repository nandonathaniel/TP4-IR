There are few studies of the health effects of long - term continuous CO exposure on humans and animals at levels below 1 % . Occupational CO exposure limits have been set in the United States at 0.5 % ( 5000 ppm ) for an eight - hour period . At this CO concentration , International Space Station crew experienced headaches , lethargy , mental slowness , emotional irritation , and sleep disruption . Studies in animals at 0.5 % CO have demonstrated kidney calcification and bone loss after eight weeks of exposure . A study of humans exposed in 2.5 hour sessions demonstrated significant effects on cognitive abilities at concentrations as low as 0.1 % ( 1000ppm ) CO likely due to CO induced increases in cerebral blood flow . Another study observed a decline in basic activity level and information usage at 1000 ppm , when compared to 500 ppm .
