Many Northerners had only recently become religious ( following the Second Great Awakening ) and religion was a powerful force in their lives . No denomination was more active in supporting the Union than the Methodist Episcopal Church . Carwardine argues that for many Methodists , the victory of Lincoln in 1860 heralded the arrival of the kingdom of God in America . They were moved into action by a vision of freedom for slaves , freedom from the persecutions of godly abolitionists , release from the Slave Power 's evil grip on the American government and the promise of a new direction for the Union . Methodists formed a major element of the popular support for the Radical Republicans with their hard line toward the white South . Dissident Methodists left the church . During Reconstruction the Methodists took the lead in helping form Methodist churches for Freedmen and moving into Southern cities even to the point of taking control , with Army help , of buildings that had belonged to the southern branch of the church .
