The cloth badge was introduced for Eagle Scouts attending the 2nd World Scout Jamboree in Denmark in 1924 with a design based on the hat pin . The Eagle Scout merit badge was sewn onto the top of the merit badge sash that was also created for the jamboree . The design is quite similar to the current badge . As with other patches of the time , the rank badges were embroidered onto rolls of fabric and then cut . The edges were folded under before sewing the badge onto the sash . Initially produced on tan cloth , it was later switched to olive for the Boy Scout uniform and white and blue to match the various Sea Scout uniforms . In 1933 , BSA was removed from all of the Eagle Scout insignia , including the badge . The text Eagle Scout and Boy Scouts of America was added to the border , and Be Prepared was added to the scroll . These badges were embroidered with silk thread , switching to cotton in 1940 .
