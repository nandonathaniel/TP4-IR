The Taiping Rebellion ( 1850 -- 1871 ) was influenced to some degree by Christian teachings , and the Boxer Rebellion ( 1899 -- 1901 ) was in part a reaction against Christianity in China . Christians in China established the first clinics and hospitals practising modern medicine , and provided the first modern training for nurses . Both Roman Catholics and Protestants founded numerous educational institutions in China from the primary to the university level . Some of the most prominent Chinese universities began as religious institutions . Missionaries worked to abolish practices such as foot binding , and the unjust treatment of maidservants , as well as launching charitable work and distributing food to the poor . They also opposed the opium trade and brought treatment to many who were addicted . Some of the early leaders of the early republic ( 1912 -- 49 ) , such as Sun Yat - sen , were converts to Christianity and were influenced by its teachings . By 1921 , Harbin , Manchuria 's largest city , had a Russian population of around 100,000 , constituting a large part of Christianity in the city .
