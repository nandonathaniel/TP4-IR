The earliest iconographic depiction of the deity is believed to be found on Stela 19 at the Olmec site of La Venta , depicting a serpent rising up behind a person probably engaged in a shamanic ritual . This depiction is believed to have been made around 900 BC . Although probably not exactly a depiction of the same feathered serpent deity worshipped in classic and post-classic periods , it shows the continuity of symbolism of feathered snakes in Mesoamerica from the formative period and on , for example in comparison to the Mayan Vision Serpent shown below .
