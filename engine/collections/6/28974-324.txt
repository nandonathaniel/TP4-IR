In the United States , as late as the 1880s most states set the minimum age at ten to twelve ( in Delaware , it was seven in 1895 ) . Inspired by the `` Maiden Tribute '' articles , female reformers in the U.S. initiated their own campaign , which petitioned legislators to raise the legal minimum age to at least sixteen , with the ultimate goal to raise the age to eighteen . The campaign was successful , with almost all states raising the minimum age to sixteen to eighteen years by 1920 .
