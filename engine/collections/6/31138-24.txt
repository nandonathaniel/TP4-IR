Whereas Gillis gave Riley bad information that got him into trouble , Digger gave him good information that `` helped him out of a hole , '' as he might have put it . Brown 's lines as the undertaker were often repetitive , including puns based on his profession ; but thanks to Brown 's delivery , the audience loved him . The program was broadcast live with a studio audience , most of whom were not aware Brown played both characters . As a result , when Digger delivered his first line , it was usually greeted with howls of laughter and applause from surprised audience members .
