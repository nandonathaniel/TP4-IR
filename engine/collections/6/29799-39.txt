As all the stars of a globular cluster are at approximately the same distance from us , their absolute magnitudes differ from their visual magnitude by about the same amount . The main - sequence stars in the globular cluster will fall along a line that is believed to be comparable to similar stars in the solar neighborhood . The accuracy of this assumption is confirmed by comparable results obtained by comparing the magnitudes of nearby short - period variables , such as RR Lyrae stars and cepheid variables , with those in the cluster .
