The Latini were a class of citizens who held the Latin Rights ( ius Latii ) , or the rights of ius commercii and ius migrationis , but not the ius connubii . The term Latini originally referred to the Latins , citizens of the Latin League who came under Roman control at the close of the Latin War , but eventually became a legal description rather than a national or ethnic one . Freedmen slaves , those of the Cives Romani convicted of crimes , or citizens settling Latin colonies could be given this status under the law .
