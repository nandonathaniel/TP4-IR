The three Texian sentinels stationed outside the walls were killed in their sleep , allowing Mexican soldiers to approach undetected within musket range of the walls . At this point , the silence was broken by shouts of `` ยก Viva Santa Anna ! '' and music from the buglers . The noise woke the Texians . Most of the noncombatants gathered in the church sacristy for safety . Travis rushed to his post yelling , `` Come on boys , the Mexicans are upon us and we 'll give them hell ! '' and , as he passed a group of Tejanos , `` ยก No rendirse , muchachos ! '' ( `` Do n't surrender , boys '' ) .
