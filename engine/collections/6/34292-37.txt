For the 2009 remake , stuntman Derek Mears was hired to portray Jason Voorhees at the recommendation of makeup special effects supervisor Scott Stoddard . Mears 's pleasant demeanor had the studio worried about his ability to portray such a menacing character on screen , but Mears assured them he would be able to perform the role . When Mears auditioned for the role he was asked why they should hire an actor over just another guy in a mask . As Mears explained , portraying Jason is similar to Greek mask work , where the mask and the actor are two separate entities , and , based on the scene , there will be various combinations of mask and actor in the performance .
