A cover story in BusinessWeek magazine claims that economists mostly failed to predict the worst international economic crisis since the Great Depression of the 1930s . The Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania 's online business journal examines why economists failed to predict a major global financial crisis . Popular articles published in the mass media have led the general public to believe that the majority of economists have failed in their obligation to predict the financial crisis . For example , an article in the New York Times informs that economist Nouriel Roubini warned of such crisis as early as September 2006 , and the article goes on to state that the profession of economics is bad at predicting recessions . According to The Guardian , Roubini was ridiculed for predicting a collapse of the housing market and worldwide recession , while The New York Times labelled him `` Dr. Doom '' .
