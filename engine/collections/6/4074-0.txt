Patriots ( also known as Revolutionaries , Continentals , Rebels , or American Whigs ) were those colonists of the Thirteen Colonies who rebelled against British control during the American Revolution and in July 1776 declared the United States of America an independent nation . Their rebellion was based on the political philosophy of republicanism , as expressed by spokesmen such as Thomas Jefferson , John Adams and Thomas Paine . They were opposed by the Loyalists who instead supported continued British rule .
