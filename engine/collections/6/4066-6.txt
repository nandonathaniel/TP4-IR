DNA was first isolated by Friedrich Miescher in 1869 . Its molecular structure was first identified by James Watson and Francis Crick at the Cavendish Laboratory within the University of Cambridge in 1953 , whose model - building efforts were guided by X-ray diffraction data acquired by Raymond Gosling , who was a post-graduate student of Rosalind Franklin . DNA is used by researchers as a molecular tool to explore physical laws and theories , such as the ergodic theorem and the theory of elasticity . The unique material properties of DNA have made it an attractive molecule for material scientists and engineers interested in micro - and nano - fabrication . Among notable advances in this field are DNA origami and DNA - based hybrid materials .
