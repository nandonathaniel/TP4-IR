The British official casualty return for the siege listed 156 killed , 326 wounded and 70 missing . Cornwallis surrendered 7,087 officers and enlisted men in Yorktown when he capitulated and a further 840 sailors from the British fleet in the York River . Another 84 prisoners had been taken during the assault on the redoubts on October 16 . Since only 70 men were reported as missing , this would suggest that 14 of the men officially marked down as ' killed ' had in fact been captured . This gives a grand total of 142 killed , 326 wounded prisoners and 7,685 other prisoners . Jerome A. Greene mentions a German account that gives much higher figures : 309 killed and 595 wounded .
