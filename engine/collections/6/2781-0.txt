A mantle plume is an upwelling of abnormally hot rock within the Earth 's mantle , first proposed by J. Tuzo Wilson in 1963 . As the heads of mantle plumes can partly melt when they reach shallow depths , they are often invoked as the cause of volcanic hotspots , such as Hawaii or Iceland , and flood basalts such as the Deccan and Siberian traps . Some such volcanic regions lie far from tectonic plate boundaries , while others represent unusually large - volume volcanism near plate boundaries or in large igneous provinces .
