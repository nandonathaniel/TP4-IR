Like other states , driving while impaired by any drug is illegal in Colorado , though it took the legislature six attempts and three years to pass marijuana intoxication measures . Ultimately the legislators decided on a nanogram limit in the bloodstream , though the number they picked was scoffed at by activists . Today Colorado law states that juries may convict a person of marijuana intoxication if they have five or more nanograms of THC per milliliter of blood , but defendants are allowed to argue that they were not intoxicated despite having such levels of THC in their bloodstream .
