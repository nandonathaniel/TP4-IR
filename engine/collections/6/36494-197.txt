God of War III received mixed reviews ; Chris Roper of IGN stated that the voice acting `` could be better '' , and that some of the characters are the `` biggest culprits '' to `` creating an uneven feeling in the visual presentation '' and that they `` do n't feature the same level of lighting quality or perhaps texture work as others . '' Roper also said that a few look `` fantastic ... but many are clearly not on the same level as Kratos , and some are even only passable as ' good ' . ''
