Because ARP does not provide methods for authenticating ARP replies on a network , ARP replies can come from systems other than the one with the required Layer 2 address . An ARP proxy is a system which answers the ARP request on behalf of another system for which it will forward traffic , normally as a part of the network 's design , such as for a dialup internet service . By contrast , in ARP spoofing the answering system , or spoofer , replies to a request for another system 's address with the aim of intercepting data bound for that system . A malicious user may use ARP spoofing to perform a man - in - the - middle or denial - of - service attack on other users on the network . Various software exists to both detect and perform ARP spoofing attacks , though ARP itself does not provide any methods of protection from such attacks .
