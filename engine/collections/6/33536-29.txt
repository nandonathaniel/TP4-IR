Six months later , Arthur is now sober . He has got back his inheritance because he is managing the company 's charity , and his mother is proud of him for finally taking something seriously ( possibly indicating his love for Naomi ) . He goes to a bookshop to buy Naomi 's book -- which she has dedicated to him -- and sees an advertisement for a book - reading she will be giving at a library . Arthur goes to the library and , this time , Naomi takes him back . The two leave the library and Bitterman drives them through the city in the Batmobile with the police following in pursuit .
