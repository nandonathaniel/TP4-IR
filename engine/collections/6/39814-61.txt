In response to Roe v. Wade , most states enacted or attempted to enact laws limiting or regulating abortion , such as laws requiring parental consent or parental notification for minors to obtain abortions ; spousal mutual consent laws ; spousal notification laws ; laws requiring abortions to be performed in hospitals , not clinics ; laws barring state funding for abortions ; laws banning intact dilation and extraction , also known as partial - birth abortion ; laws requiring waiting periods before abortions ; and laws mandating that women read certain types of literature and watch a fetal ultrasound before undergoing an abortion . In 1976 , Congress passed the Hyde Amendment , barring federal funding of abortions ( except in cases of rape , incest , or a threat to the life of the mother ) for poor women through the Medicaid program . The Supreme Court struck down some state restrictions in a long series of cases stretching from the mid-1970s to the late 1980s , but upheld restrictions on funding , including the Hyde Amendment , in the case of Harris v. McRae ( 1980 ) .
