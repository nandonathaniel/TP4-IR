Mast : the main supporting tower of the crane . It is made of steel trussed sections that are connected together during installation . Slewing unit : the slewing unit sits at the top of the mast . This is the engine that enables the crane to rotate . Operating cabin : on most tower cranes the operating cabin sits just above the slewing unit . It contains the operating controls , LMI , scale , anemometer , etc . Jib : the jib , or operating arm , extends horizontally from the crane . A `` luffing '' jib is able to move up and down ; a fixed jib has a rolling trolley that runs along the underside to move goods horizontally . Counter jib : holds counterweights , hoist motor , hoist drum and the electronics . Hoist winch : the hoist winch assembly consists of the hoist winch itself ( motor , gearbox , hoist drum , hoist rope , and brakes ) , the hoist motor controller , and supporting components such as the platform . Many tower cranes have transmissions with two or more speeds . Hook : the hook ( or hooks ) is used to connect the material to the crane . It is suspended from the hoist rope either at the tip , for luffing jib cranes , or in the hoist rope belly underneath the trolley for hammerhead cranes . Weights : Large concrete counterweights are mounted toward the rear of the counterdeck , to compensate for the weight of the goods lifted .
