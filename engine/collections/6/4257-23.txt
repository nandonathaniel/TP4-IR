The U.S. Census Bureau contracts to use Herman Hollerith 's punched card tabulating technology on the 1890 United States Census . That census was completed in 6 - years and estimated to have saved the government $5 million . The prior , 1880 , census had required 8 - years . The years required are not directly comparable ; the two differed in : population size , data collected , resources ( census bureau headcount , machines , ... ) , and reports prepared . The total population of 62,947,714 , the family , or rough , count , was announced after only six weeks of processing ( punched cards were not used for this tabulation ) . Hollerith 's punched cards become the tabulating industry standard for input for the next 70 years . Hollerith 's The Tabulating Machine Company is later consolidated into what becomes IBM .
