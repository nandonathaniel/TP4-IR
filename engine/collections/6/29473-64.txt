Modern Age characteristics The concept of the modern world as distinct from an ancient or medieval world rests on a sense that the modern world is not just another era in history , but rather the result of a new type of change . This is usually conceived of as progress driven by deliberate human efforts to better their situation . Advances in all areas of human activity -- politics , industry , society , economics , commerce , transport , communication , mechanization , automation , science , medicine , technology , and culture -- appear to have transformed an Old World into the Modern or New World . In each case , the identification of the old Revolutionary change can be used to demarcate the old and old - fashioned from the modern . Portions of the Modern world altered its relationship with the Biblical value system , revalued the monarchical government system , and abolished the feudal economic system , with new democratic and liberal ideas in the areas of politics , science , psychology , sociology , and economics .
