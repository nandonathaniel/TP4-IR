Each major segment of the early Triassic ecosystem -- plant and animal , marine and terrestrial -- was dominated by a small number of genera , which appeared virtually worldwide , for example : the herbivorous therapsid Lystrosaurus ( which accounted for about 90 % of early Triassic land vertebrates ) and the bivalves Claraia , Eumorphotis , Unionites and Promylina . A healthy ecosystem has a much larger number of genera , each living in a few preferred types of habitat .
