Lowell E. Gallaway and Richard K. Vedder argue on the basis of libertarian theories that the Great Depression was caused by too high wages which they say had caused a loss of depositor confidence which caused the bank runs . They further conclude that the `` Great Depression was very significantly prolonged in both its duration and its magnitude by the impact of New Deal programs '' . They suggest that without Social Security , work relief , unemployment insurance , mandatory minimum wages and without special government - granted privileges for labor unions , business would have hired more workers and the unemployment rate during the New Deal years would have been 6.7 % instead of 17.2 % . Amity Shlaes wrote that `` from 1929 to 1940 , from Hoover to Roosevelt , government intervention helped to make the Depression Great '' . Shlaes said that the NRA was misguided because it used price setting to fix monetary problems . According to Shlaes , Roosevelt 's experimentation frightened business into inaction and prevented recovery . Eric Rauchway showed that Shlaes tried to diminish the economic growth by referring to the unrepresentative Dow Jones Industrial Average . He continued that usually a historian or economist would have referred to the gross domestic product , which according to the Historical Statistics of the United States grew impressively by 9 % annually during Roosevelt 's first term and by 11 % annually after the short recession of 1937 -- 1938 .
