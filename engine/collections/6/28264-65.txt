Given that DNA and RNA polymerases both carry out template - dependent nucleotide polymerization , it might be expected that the two types of enzymes would be structurally related . However , x-ray crystallographic studies of both types of enzymes reveal that , other than containing a critical Mg2+ ion at the catalytic site , they are virtually unrelated to each other ; indeed template - dependent nucleotide polymerizing enzymes seem to have arisen independently twice during the early evolution of cells . One lineage led to the modern DNA Polymerases and reverse transcriptases , as well as to a few single - subunit RNA polymerases from viruses . The other lineage formed all of the modern cellular RNA polymerases .
