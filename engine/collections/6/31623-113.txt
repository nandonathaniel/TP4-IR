20th Century Fox and Paramount Pictures co-financed Titanic , with Paramount handling the North American distribution and Fox handling the international release . They expected Cameron to complete the film for a release on July 2 , 1997 . The film was to be released on this date `` in order to exploit the lucrative summer season ticket sales when blockbuster films usually do better '' . In April , Cameron said the film 's special effects were too complicated and that releasing the film for summer would not be possible . With production delays , Paramount pushed back the release date to December 19 , 1997 . `` This fueled speculation that the film itself was a disaster . '' A preview screening in Minneapolis on July 14 `` generated positive reviews '' and `` ( c ) hatter on the internet was responsible for more favorable word of mouth about the ( film ) '' . This eventually led to more positive media coverage .
