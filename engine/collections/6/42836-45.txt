This provides substantial circumstantial evidence that deliberate voyagers were involved in carrying coconuts across the Pacific Ocean ( possibly the Austronesian peoples ) and that they could not have dispersed worldwide without human agency . More recently , genomic analysis of cultivated coconut ( C. nucifera L . ) has shed light on the movement . However , admixture , the transfer of genetic material , evidently occurred between the two populations .
