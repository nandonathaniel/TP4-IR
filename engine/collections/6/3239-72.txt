As in the film , the Cleveland Browns made splashes at the draft , trading up to select quarterback Johnny Manziel with the 22nd pick . The team also made several deals , trading away their fourth pick to the Buffalo Bills but for their ninth pick , as well as their 2015 first round pick . They later traded up to the eighth pick to draft Justin Gilbert . Finally , after watching Manziel drop farther than projected , they again traded up for the 22nd pick . Chris Berman , who played himself in the fictionalized draft , commented at the 2014 NFL Draft that the events surrounding the Cleveland Browns were more exciting than the film . Unlike the film , the Browns selected the much - hyped Heisman Trophy winning quarterback , as opposed to passing on Bo Callahan , the fictionalized first pick favorite .
