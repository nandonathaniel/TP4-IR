The Septuagint , or the LXX , is a translation of the Hebrew Scriptures and some related texts into Koine Greek , begun in the late 3rd century BCE and completed by 132 BCE , initially in Alexandria , but in time it was completed elsewhere as well . It is not altogether clear which was translated when , or where ; some may even have been translated twice , into different versions , and then revised .
