built on Progressive - era strategies of municipal housekeeping . During the Progressive era , female activists used traditional constructions of womanhood , which imagined all women as mothers and homemakers , to justify their entrance into community affairs : as `` municipal housekeepers , '' they would clean up politics , cities , and see after the health and wellbeing of their neighbors . Donning the mantle of motherhood , female activists methodically investigated their community 's needs and used their `` maternal '' expertise to lobby , create , and secure a place for themselves in an emerging state welfare bureaucracy , best illustrated perhaps by clubwoman Julia Lathrop 's leadership in the Children 's Bureau . As part of this tradition of maternal activism , the Progressive - era General Federation supported a range of causes from the pure food and drug administration to public health care for mothers and children to a ban on child labor , each of which looked to the state to help implement their vision of social justice .
