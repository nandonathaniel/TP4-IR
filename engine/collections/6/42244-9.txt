The first person to divide New Testament chapters into verses was Italian Dominican biblical scholar Santi Pagnini ( 1470 -- 1541 ) , but his system was never widely adopted . His verse divisions in the New Testament were far longer than those known today . Robert Estienne created an alternate numbering in his 1551 edition of the Greek New Testament which was also used in his 1553 publication of the Bible in French . Estienne 's system of division was widely adopted , and it is this system which is found in almost all modern Bibles . Estienne produced a 1555 Vulgate that is the first Bible to include the verse numbers integrated into the text . Before this work , they were printed in the margins .
