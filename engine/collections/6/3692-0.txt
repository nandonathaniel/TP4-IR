In computer networking a routing table , or routing information base ( RIB ) , is a data table stored in a router or a networked computer that lists the routes to particular network destinations , and in some cases , metrics ( distances ) associated with those routes . The routing table contains information about the topology of the network immediately around it . The construction of routing tables is the primary goal of routing protocols . Static routes are entries made in a routing table by non-automatic means and which are fixed rather than being the result of some network topology `` discovery '' procedure .
