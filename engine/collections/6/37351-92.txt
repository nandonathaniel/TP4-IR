Expansion sets are currently released in a two - set block , starting with a large set and ending with a smaller one three months later . Prior to 2016 , expansion sets were released in a three - set block ( again , beginning with a larger set followed by two smaller sets ) . These sets consist almost exclusively of newly designed cards . Contrasting with the wide - ranging Core Set , each expansion is focused around a subset of mechanics and ties into a set storyline . Expansions also dedicate several cards to a handful of particular , often newly introduced , game mechanics .
