The trio head to Albania on a road trip with three cars to see which will be best for the `` Albanian Mafia '' - May believes the new Rolls - Royce Ghost will be suitable , Hammond thinks it will be the Mercedes - Benz S - Class AMG , while Clarkson proves it will be the `` Bentley Mulsanne '' ( in reality , Bentley pulled out , so the Mulsanne was represented by a Yugo ) . On their trip , they see if they squeeze the `` body '' of a fat man into each car 's boot , hold a drag race on an airfield , and try to escape from the Albanian police after `` robbing a bank '' . Meanwhile , Clarkson compares the Cosworth Impreza STI CS400 with the Ford Focus RS500 and the one - off Volvo C30 PCP , while chat show host , Jonathan Ross , returns after 15 seasons to see how much improved he will be in the Kia Cee 'd .
