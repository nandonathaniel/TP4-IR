However contrary to federal laws in both countries , those treatment system upgrades have not yet eliminated Combined sewer Overflow events . This describes when older sewerage systems , which combine storm water with sewage into single sewers heading to the treatment plant , are temporarily overwhelmed by heavy rainstorms . Local sewage treatment authorities then must release untreated effluent , a mix of rainwater and sewage , into local water bodies . While enormous public investments such as the Deep Tunnel projects in Chicago and Milwaukee have greatly reduced the frequency and volume of these events , they have not been eliminated . The number of such overflow events in Ontario , for example , is flat according to the International Joint Commission . Reports about this issue on the U.S. side highlight five large municipal systems ( those of Detroit , Cleveland , Buffalo , Milwaukee and Gary ) as being the largest current periodic sources of untreated discharges into the Great Lakes .
