Second line is a tradition in brass band parades in New Orleans , Louisiana . The `` main line '' or `` first line '' is the main section of the parade , or the members of the actual club with the parading permit as well as the brass band . Those who follow the band just to enjoy the music are called the `` second line . '' The second line 's style of traditional dance , in which participants walk and sometimes twirl a parasol or handkerchief in the air , is called `` second lining . '' It has been called `` the quintessential New Orleans art form -- a jazz funeral without a body . '' Another significant difference from so called `` jazz funerals '' is second line parades usually lack the slow hymns and dirges played at funerals ( although this is not a hard rule ; some organizations may have the band play something solemn towards the start of the parade in memory of members deceased since their last parade ) .
