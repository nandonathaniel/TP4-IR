The Civilian Conservation Corps ( CCC ) was a public work relief program that operated from 1933 to 1942 in the United States for unemployed , unmarried men . Originally for young men ages 18 -- 25 , it was eventually expanded to ages 17 -- 28 . Robert Fechner was the first director of the agency , succeeded by James McEntee following Fechner 's death . The CCC was a major part of President Franklin D. Roosevelt 's New Deal that provided unskilled manual labor jobs related to the conservation and development of natural resources in rural lands owned by federal , state , and local governments . The CCC was designed to provide jobs for young men and to relieve families who had difficulty finding jobs during the Great Depression in the United States . Maximum enrollment at any one time was 300,000 . Through the course of its nine years in operation , 3 million young men participated in the CCC , which provided them with shelter , clothing , and food , together with a wage of $30 ( about $570 in 2017 ) per month ( $25 of which had to be sent home to their families ) .
