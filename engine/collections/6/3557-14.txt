Several inventors devised machines to record sound prior to Thomas Edison 's phonograph , Edison being the first to invent a device that could both record and reproduce sound . The phonograph 's predecessors include Édouard - Léon Scott de Martinville 's phonautograph , and Charles Cros 's paleophone . Recordings made with the phonautograph were intended to be visual representations of the sound and were not to be reproduced as sound until 2008 . Cros 's paleophone was intended to both record and reproduce sound but had not been developed beyond a basic concept at the time of Edison 's successful demonstration of the Phonograph in 1877 .
