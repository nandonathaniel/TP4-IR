In certain tournaments , the byes are somewhat disguised . Since 2012 , the Major League Baseball playoffs has included ten teams consisting of six division winners and four wildcard teams ( the top - ranked non-division - winners ) . The first round of the playoffs consists two wild - card games : single - game matches in which the four wild - card teams are reduced to two . The winners move on to the Divisional series with the six division winners for an eight - team , three - round tournament . Although this is billed as adding two extra `` one - game showdowns '' to the post-season , it could also be viewed as adding a fourth round to the ten - team tournament with six byes for the division winners . The FA Cup also has certain teams compete in up to 6 preliminary rounds to qualify for the first round `` proper '' . Another example is the NCAA Basketball Tournament , which effectively grants 60 byes for its `` play - in '' round , as eight teams compete for the final four spots in the tournament , though the play - in round and all eight of those teams are officially part of the tournament .
