As explained above , while s is an unbiased estimator for the population variance , s is still a biased estimator for the population standard deviation , though markedly less biased than the uncorrected sample standard deviation . This estimator is commonly used and generally known simply as the `` sample standard deviation '' . The bias may still be large for small samples ( N less than 10 ) . As sample size increases , the amount of bias decreases . We obtain more information and the difference between 1 N ( \ displaystyle ( \ frac ( 1 ) ( N ) ) ) and 1 N âˆ’ 1 ( \ displaystyle ( \ frac ( 1 ) ( N - 1 ) ) ) becomes smaller .
