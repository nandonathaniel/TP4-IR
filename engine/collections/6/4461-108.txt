For the third straight year Dallas once again found themselves stuck in the . 500 area . In Week 5 , they lost a shootout to eventual AFC Champion Denver Broncos 51 -- 48 . They battled it out with Philadelphia for control of the division throughout the season . In December however they lost 2 crucial back to back games to Chicago and Green Bay . They were very successful in division games having a 5 -- 0 division record heading into another Week 17 showdown for the NFC East crown against the Eagles . That included beating Washington 24 -- 23 on Week 16 thanks to late game heroics of Tony Romo . However Romo received a severe back injury in that game which prematurely ended his season . The Cowboys called upon backup QB Kyle Orton to lead them into battle on the final week of the season . Orton was unsuccessful who threw a game ending interception to the Eagles which allowed Philly to win 24 -- 22 . Dallas ended the year at 8 -- 8 for the third year in a row . The only difference of this 8 -- 8 ending compared to the others was that Dallas ended the season in second place compared to the 2 previous 3rd - place finishes .
