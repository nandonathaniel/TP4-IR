The 1836 article and other sources make it clear that this verse was not used soon after 1745 , and certainly before the song became accepted as the British national anthem in the 1780s and 1790s . It was included as an integral part of the song in the Oxford Book of Eighteenth Century Verse of 1926 , although erroneously referencing the `` fourth verse '' to the Gentleman 's Magazine article of 1745 .
