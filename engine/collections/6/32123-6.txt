The infamous pirate Blackbeard spent the winter of 1717 -- 1718 harassing shipping boats sailing to and from the port of Vera Cruz , Mexico and traversing the Bay of Honduras . In April 1718 , at Turneffe Atoll , Blackbeard captured the logwood cutting sloop Adventure and forced its captain , David Herriot , to join him . Blackbeard then made Israel Hands captain of the Adventure and began sailing for North Carolina .
