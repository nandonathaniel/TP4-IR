March 1917 also brought the first of two revolutions in Russia , which impacted the strategic role of the U.S. in the war . The overthrow of the imperial government removed a serious barrier to America 's entry into the European conflict , while the second revolution in November relieved the Germans of a major threat on their eastern front , and allowed them to dedicate more troops to the Western front , thus making U.S. forces central to Allied success in battles of 1918 . Wilson initially rebuffed pleas from the Allies to dedicate military resources to an intervention in Russia against the Bolsheviks , based partially on his experience from attempted intervention in Mexico ; nevertheless he ultimately was convinced of the potential benefit and agreed to dispatch a limited force to assist the Allies on the eastern front .
