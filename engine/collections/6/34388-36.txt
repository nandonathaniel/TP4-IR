Eilean Donan Castle went through several phases of development from the earliest fortifications of the 13th century through to its destruction in 1719 , and the subsequent reconstruction in the 20th century . The first phase comprised a curtain wall enclosing much of the island , with a tower house added in the 14th century . In the 14th or 15th century the outer wall was abandoned and a smaller enclosure built around the tower house . More development within this courtyard took place in the 16th century , as well as the addition of a defences on the eastern side . The castle was almost totally destroyed in 1719 , after which almost 200 years passed before reconstruction began . Although some archaeological evidence has been recovered from the island , much material was lost during the reconstruction works making it difficult to build a clear picture of the early castle . Very little historical evidence survives . Mapmaker Timothy Pont ( c. 1565 -- 1614 ) left a description :
