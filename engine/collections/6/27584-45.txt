As soon as the number of free male settlers exceeded 5,000 , the Territorial Legislature was to be created , and this happened in 1798 . The full mechanisms of government were put in place , as outlined in the Northwest Ordinance . A bicameral legislature consisted of a House of Representatives and a Council . The first House had 22 representatives , apportioned by population of each county . The House then nominated 10 citizens to be Council members . The nominations were sent to the U.S. Congress , which appointed five of them as the Council . This assembly became the legislature of the Territory , although the governor retained veto power .
