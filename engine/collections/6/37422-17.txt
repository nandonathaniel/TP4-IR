As a member of the New York Performance Consortium , MCHS has a waiver from the city and state of New York for NY State Regents Exams . Students are only required to take and pass the NY State English Regents , another move away from traditional high - stakes testing . Under the waiver , students are required to create a portfolio of final projects from their classes during their time at MCHS . In 10th grade , students participate in a `` Gateway Presentation '' . Students are mentored and must present a final project from 9th or 10th grade to a panel of students and teachers . In 12th grade , as a graduation requirement , students must do an `` Oral Defense Presentation '' , in which they must present three projects to a panel of teachers . Students are given a faculty mentor as a senior in order to prepare for their presentation .
