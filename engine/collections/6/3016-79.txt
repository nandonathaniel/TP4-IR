Big Star 's original version of the song was not used on the show . Instead , a cover version sung by Todd Griffin was used as the theme song for the show 's first season . Beginning in the second season , the theme song was performed by the band Cheap Trick . Unlike previous versions of the song , Cheap Trick ended the song with the repeated phrase `` We 're all alright ! '' quoting the ending of their 1978 hit song `` Surrender '' .
