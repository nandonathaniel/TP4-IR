The melody is similar to `` Miss Lucy Long '' and was originally set for piano accompaniment , although `` De Blue Tail Fly '' was marketed in Boston as one of `` Emmett 's Banjo Melodies '' . The four - part chorus favors a single bass and three tenors : the first and third tenors harmonize in thirds with the second completes the triads or doubles the root , sometimes crossing the melody line . The versions published in 1846 differed rather markedly : `` De Blue Tail Fly '' is modal ( although Lhamar emends its B ♭ notation to C minor ) and hexatonic ; `` Jim Crack Corn '' , meanwhile , is in G major and more easily singable . Its simplicity has made it a common beginner 's tune for acoustic guitar . The melody is a chain of thirds ( G-B , F ♯ - A , G-B , ( A ) - C , B-D , C-E ) harmonized a third above and below in the manner of the choruses in Italian opera .
