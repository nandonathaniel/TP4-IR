Pinky ( voiced by Ashleigh Ball ) is a pink ghost , the only female and the second youngest in the Ghost Gang Family . She is described as `` a bad , but not really bad guy '' She has a crush on Pac - Man ( like in Pac - Man World 2 ) and is aggressive towards him . She has a rivalry with Cylindria because they got off on the wrong foot and she thinks Cyli might also have a crush on Pac - Man and does n't know that they 're just friends though Cyli is able to hide hers better . Despite the gang 's fear of Betrayus , Pinky is often the sole member of the gang who is willing to go out of her way to help Pac in the more risky situations . She is also the first to side with Pac even when the odds are more in Betrayus ' favor . In the episode `` Stand By Your Pac - Man , '' she revealed that she can transform into a pink cyclops ghost and she assumed this form in three other episodes in the second season . She often argues with her brothers , but loves them nonetheless . She has expressed a desire to get her original body back from the repository , but prioritizes Pac - Man 's interests instead . Pac dubs his World of Odd counterpart who resembles Dorothy Gale as Mama Ghost .
