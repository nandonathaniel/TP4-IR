While not all Southerners saw themselves as fighting to preserve slavery , most of the officers and over a third of the rank and file in Lee 's army had close family ties to slavery . To Northerners , in contrast , the motivation was primarily to preserve the Union , not to abolish slavery . Abraham Lincoln consistently made preserving the Union the central goal of the war , though he increasingly saw slavery as a crucial issue and made ending it an additional goal . Lincoln 's decision to issue the Emancipation Proclamation angered both Peace Democrats ( `` Copperheads '' ) and War Democrats , but energized most Republicans . By warning that free blacks would flood the North , Democrats made gains in the 1862 elections , but they did not gain control of Congress . The Republicans ' counterargument that slavery was the mainstay of the enemy steadily gained support , with the Democrats losing decisively in the 1863 elections in the northern state of Ohio when they tried to resurrect anti-black sentiment .
