With the help of the Scots , Parliament won at Marston Moor ( 2 July 1644 ) , gaining York and the north of England . Cromwell 's conduct in this battle proved decisive , and demonstrated his potential as both a political and an important military leader . The defeat at the Battle of Lostwithiel in Cornwall , however , marked a serious reverse for Parliament in the south - west of England . Subsequent fighting around Newbury ( 27 October 1644 ) , though tactically indecisive , strategically gave another check to Parliament .
