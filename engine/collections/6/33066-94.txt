Pack tactics were first used successfully in September and October 1940 , to devastating effect , in a series of convoy battles . On September 21 , convoy HX 72 of 42 merchantmen was attacked by a pack of four U-boats , losing eleven ships sunk and two damaged over two nights . In October , the slow convoy SC 7 , with an escort of two sloops and two corvettes , was overwhelmed , losing 59 % of its ships . The battle for HX 79 in the following days was in many ways worse for the escorts than for SC 7 . The loss of a quarter of the convoy without any loss to the U-boats , despite very strong escort ( two destroyers , four corvettes , three trawlers , and a minesweeper ) demonstrated the effectiveness of the German tactics against the inadequate British anti-submarine methods . On December 1 , seven German and three Italian submarines caught HX 90 , sinking 10 ships and damaging three others . The success of pack tactics against these convoys encouraged Admiral DÃ¶nitz to adopt the wolf pack as his primary tactic .
