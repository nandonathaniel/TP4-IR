The track was refined with remixing and additional parts added on 20 January and 3 February . During the latter session , McCartney and Starr re-recorded their contributions on bass guitar and drums , respectively . Starr later highlighted his fills on the song as typical of an approach whereby `` I try to become an instrument ; play the mood of the song . For example , ' Four thousand holes in Blackburn , Lancashire , ' -- boom ba bom . I try to show that ; the disenchanting mood . '' As on the 1966 track `` Rain '' , music journalist Ben Edmonds recognises Starr 's playing as reflective of his empathy with Lennon 's songwriting . In Edmonds ' description , the drumming on `` A Day in the Life '' `` transcends timekeeping to embody psychedelic drift -- mysterious , surprising , without losing sight of its rhythmic role '' .
