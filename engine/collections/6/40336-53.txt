Although the film 's cinematographer , Winton Hoch , won an Academy Award for his work , filming was not a smooth creative process because of conflicts with Ford . Ironically one of the most iconic scenes from the film was created during a dispute . As a line of cavalry rode through the desert , a real thunderstorm grew on the horizon . Hoch began to pack up the cameras as the weather worsened only for Ford to order him to keep shooting . Hoch argued that there was not enough natural light for the scene and , more importantly , the cameras could become potential lightning rods if the storm swept over them . Ford ignored Hoch 's complaints ; completing the scene as the thunderstorm rolled in , soaking the cast and crew . Hoch later had filed a letter of complaint against Ford with the American Society of Cinematographers over the filming of this scene .
