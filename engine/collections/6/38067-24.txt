A recent study by Gottschall and Nichols studied the hindlimb of a decerebrate cat during walking ( a CPG controlled function ) in response to changes in head pitch . This study describes the differences in gait and body position of cats walking uphill , downhill and on level surfaces . Proprioceptive ( Golgi tendon organs and muscle spindles ) and exteroreceptive ( optic , vestibular and cutaneous ) receptors work alone or in combination to adjust the CPG to sensory feedback . The study explored the effects of neck proprioceptors ( giving information about the relative location of the head and body ) and vestibular receptors ( giving information about the orientation of the head relative to gravity ) . Decerebrate cats were made to walk on a level surface with their heads level , tilted up or tilted down . Comparing the decerebrate cats to normal cats showed similar EMG patterns during level walking and EMG patterns that reflected downhill walking with the head titled up and uphill walking with the head tilted down . This study proved that neck proprioceptors and vestibular receptors contribute sensory feedback that alters the gait of the animal . This information may be useful for treatment of gait disorders .
