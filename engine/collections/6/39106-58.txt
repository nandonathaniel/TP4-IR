After receiving news of the route he was about to take from his scouts and messages from the Celtic tribes that resided around the Alps , the Carthaginians set out . He departed with 90,000 heavy infantry from various African and Iberian nations , and 12,000 cavalry . From the Ebro to the Pyrenees the Carthaginians confronted four tribes , the Illergetes , the Bargusii , the Aeronosii and the Andosini . There were a number of cities here that Hannibal took , which Polybius does not specify . This campaign was conducted with speed in order to take as little time as possible in the reduction of this region . Polybius reports severe losses on Hannibal 's part . Having reduced this area , he left his brother Hanno in command of this area , specifically over the Bargusii , whom he had reason to distrust due to their affiliation with the Romans . He left his brother in control of this country with 10,000 infantry and 1,000 cavalry .
