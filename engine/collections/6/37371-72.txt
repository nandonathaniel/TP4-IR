The King and his advisers were concerned about the rise of socialism and the growing labour movement , which they mistakenly associated with republicanism . The socialists no longer believed in their anti-monarchical slogans and were ready to come to terms with the monarchy if it took the first step . George adopted a more democratic , inclusive stance that crossed class lines and brought the monarchy closer to the public and the working class -- a dramatic change for the King , who was most comfortable with naval officers and landed gentry . He cultivated friendly relations with moderate Labour party politicians and trade union officials . His abandonment of social aloofness conditioned the royal family 's behaviour and enhanced its popularity during the economic crises of the 1920s and for over two generations thereafter .
