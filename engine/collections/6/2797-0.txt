In Christianity and Judaism , the Book of Life ( Hebrew : ספר החיים , transliterated Sefer HaChaim ; Greek : βιβλίον τῆς ζωῆς Biblíon tēs Zōēs ) is the book in which God records the names of every person who is destined for Heaven or the World to Come . According to the Talmud it is open on Rosh Hashanah , as is its analog for the wicked , the Book of the Dead . For this reason extra mention is made for the Book of Life during Amidah recitations during the Days of Awe , the ten days between Rosh Hashanah , the Jewish new year , and Yom Kippur , the day of atonement ( the two High Holidays , particularly in the prayer Unetaneh Tokef ) .
