It is not known how Wang and Liu actually came across these `` dragon bones '' , but Wang is credited with being the first to recognize their significance . Wang committed suicide in 1900 in connection with his involvement in the Boxer Rebellion , and his son later sold the bones to friend Liu E , who published the first book of rubbings of the oracle bone inscriptions in 1903 . News of the discovery of the oracle bones spread quickly throughout China and among foreign collectors and scholars , and the market for oracle bones exploded , though many collectors sought to keep the location of the bones ' source a secret . Although scholars tried to find their source , antique dealers falsely claimed that the bones came from Tangyin in Henan . In 1908 , scholar Luo Zhenyu discovered the source of the bones near Anyang and realized that the area was the site of the last Shang dynasty capital .
