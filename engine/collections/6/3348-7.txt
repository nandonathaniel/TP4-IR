Stellar parallax created by the relative motion between the Earth and a star can be seen , in the Copernican model , as arising from the orbit of the Earth around the Sun : the star only appears to move relative to more distant objects in the sky . In a geostatic model , the movement of the star would have to be taken as real with the star oscillating across the sky with respect to the background stars .
