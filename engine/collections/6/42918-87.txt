Richard Corliss of TIME heralded the film and its director , Steve McQueen , by stating : `` Indeed , McQueen 's film is closer in its storytelling particulars to such 1970s exploitation - expos√©s of slavery as Mandingo and Goodbye , Uncle Tom . Except that McQueen is not a schlockmeister sensationalist but a remorseless artist . '' Corliss draws parallels with Nazi Germany , saying , `` McQueen shows that racism , aside from its barbarous inhumanity , is insanely inefficient . It can be argued that Nazi Germany lost the war both because it diverted so much manpower to the killing of Jews and because it did not exploit the brilliance of Jewish scientists in building smarter weapons . So the slave owners dilute the energy of their slaves by whipping them for sadistic sport and , as Epps does , waking them at night to dance for his wife 's cruel pleasure . '' Gregory Ellwood of HitFix gave the film an `` A - '' rating , stating , `` 12 Years is a powerful drama driven by McQueen 's bold direction and the finest performance of Chiwetel Ejiofor 's career . '' He continued by praising the performances of Fassbender and Nyong'o , citing Nyong'o as `` the film 's breakthrough performance ( that ) may find Nyong'o making her way to the Dolby Theater next March '' . He also admired the film 's `` gorgeous '' cinematography and the musical score , as `` one of Hans Zimmer 's more moving scores in some time '' . Paul MacInnes of The Guardian scored the film five out of five stars , writing , `` Stark , visceral and unrelenting , 12 Years a Slave is not just a great film but a necessary one . ''
