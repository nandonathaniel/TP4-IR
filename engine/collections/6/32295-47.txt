... And Then There Were Three ... was released in March 1978 . It received some mixed reviews from critics at the time owing to the album only containing short songs , which excited new fans but disillusioned those who had been used to the band 's previous work . Chris Welch wrote a positive review in Melody Maker , citing a `` remarkably powerful '' album . It was a commercial success and peaked at No. 3 in the UK and No. 14 in the US . `` Follow You Follow Me '' was released as its lead single and reached No. 7 in the UK and No. 23 in the US , their highest charting single in both countries since their formation . Its success introduced the band to a new audience , including a larger female interest , helped by its music video airing on Top of the Pops . Its success caused some fans to accuse the group of selling out to more commercial music . A follow up single , `` Many Too Many '' , was less successful as it had already appeared on the album .
