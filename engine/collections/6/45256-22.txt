The Tiber was critically important to Roman trade and commerce , as ships could reach as far as 100 kilometres ( 60 mi ) upriver ; there is evidence that it was used to ship grain from the Val Teverina as long ago as the 5th century BC . It was later used to ship stone , timber and foodstuffs to Rome .
