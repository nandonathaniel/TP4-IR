The mediterranean forests , woodlands , and scrub biome is closely associated with mediterranean climate zones , as are unique freshwater communities . Particularly distinctive of the climate are sclerophyll shrublands , called maquis in the Mediterranean Basin , chaparral in California , matorral in Chile , fynbos in South Africa , and mallee and kwongan shrublands in Australia . Aquatic communities in mediterranean climate regions are adapted to a yearly cycle in which abiotic ( environmental ) controls of stream populations and community structure dominate during floods , biotic components ( e.g. competition and predation ) controls become increasingly important as the discharge declines , and environmental controls regain dominance as environmental conditions become very harsh ( i.e. hot and dry ) ; as a result , these communities are well suited to recover from droughts , floods , and fires . Aquatic organisms in these regions show distinct long - term patterns in structure and function , and are also highly sensitive to the effects of climate change .
