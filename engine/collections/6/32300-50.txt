The only other aspect is performance -- do MMU - based or non-MMU - based systems provide better performance ? MCP systems may be implemented on top of standard hardware that does have an MMU ( for example , a standard PC ) . Even if the system implementation uses the MMU in some way , this will not be at all visible at the MCP level .
