In 1854 and 1856 , Ferdinand de Lesseps obtained a concession from Sa'id Pasha , the Khedive of Egypt and Sudan , to create a company to construct a canal open to ships of all nations . The company was to operate the canal for 99 years from its opening . De Lesseps had used his friendly relationship with Sa'id , which he had developed while he was a French diplomat in the 1830s . As stipulated in the concessions , Ferdinand convened the International Commission for the piercing of the isthmus of Suez ( Commission Internationale pour le percement de l'isthme des Suez ) consisting of 13 experts from seven countries , among them John Robinson McClean , later President of the Institution of Civil Engineers in London , and again Negrelli , to examine the plans developed by Linant de Bellefonds , and to advise on the feasibility of and the best route for the canal . After surveys and analyses in Egypt and discussions in Paris on various aspects of the canal , where many of Negrelli 's ideas prevailed , the commission produced a unanimous report in December 1856 containing a detailed description of the canal complete with plans and profiles . The Suez Canal Company ( Compagnie universelle du canal maritime de Suez ) came into being on 15 December 1858 and work started on the shore of the future Port Said on 25 April 1859 .
