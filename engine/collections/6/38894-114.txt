On February 1 , 2012 , the European Commission blocked the merger of NYSE with Deutsche Börse , after commissioner Joaquin Almunia stated that the merger `` would have led to a near - monopoly in European financial derivatives worldwide . '' Instead , Deutsche Börse and NYSE will have to sell either their Eurex derivatives or LIFFE shares in order to not create a monopoly . On February 2 , 2012 , NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Börse agreed to scrap the merger .
