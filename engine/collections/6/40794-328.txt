Cockades were widely worn by revolutionaries beginning in 1789 . They now pinned the blue - and - red cockade of Paris onto the white cockade of the Ancien RÃ©gime -- thus producing the original Tricolore cockade . Later , distinctive colours and styles of cockade would indicate the wearer 's faction -- although the meanings of the various styles were not entirely consistent , and varied somewhat by region and period .
