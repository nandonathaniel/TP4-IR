1922 -- On October 28 , 1922 , the term `` Hail Mary play '' was used by Knute Rockne 's Notre Dame Fighting Irish in a victory over Georgia Tech . Notre Dame trailed 3 -- 0 in the second half and had been unable to move the ball effectively . Noble Kizer , the one Presbyterian player on the Notre Dame team , stopped play and said to his teammates , `` Boys , let 's have a Hail Mary . '' They all prayed , and Elmer Layden scored a touchdown . On the next possession , Kizer said , `` Let 's have another Hail Mary , '' and Layden scored another touchdown . After the game , Kizer said , `` Say , that Hail Mary is the best play we 've got . '' An account written in 1935 presented a variation on the 1922 `` Hail Mary '' play as follows : `` In the huddle the boys were surprised to hear the non-Catholic say : ' C'mon fellows let 's have a ' Hail Mary . ' The boys said the quick prayer and on the next play Jimmy Crowley dashed 30 yards for a touchdown . Some time later Notre Dame was again stopped and again this non-Catholic called on the boys for a Hail Mary . On the next play Stuhldreher tossed a 25 yard pass to Layden for a score . In between halves this same lad was chuckling to himself . He turned to one of his teammates and said , ' Boy that Hail Mary is a ________ of a play . ' '' 1935 -- On November 2 , 1935 , Notre Dame faced an undefeated Ohio State team and trailed 13 -- 0 at the start of the fourth quarter . Notre Dame scored two touchdowns to cut Ohio State 's lead to 13 -- 12 . With less than a minute left in the game , Notre Dame quarterback Andy Pilney ran 30 yards to the Ohio State 19 - yard line . Pilney was injured and had to be carried off the field on a stretcher . William Shakespeare ( nicknamed the `` Merchant of Menace '' ) replaced Pilney . With the clock running out , the ball was snapped to the fullback who handed it to Shakespeare on what appeared to be a reverse . Shakespeare threw a pass into the end zone , which was caught by Wayne Millner on his knees for an 18 -- 13 win . Red Barber , who broadcast the game on radio , later called it `` the greatest college football game I ever called . '' Radio announcer Tom Manning added , `` I always said Shakespeare had a pair of rosary beads and a bottle of holy water in his back pocket . '' The media picked up stories of the Catholic faithful praying for Notre Dame as they listened to the game on the radio . One nun told a reporter of overhearing a colleague in her convent `` gamefully bargaining '' and eventually `` threatening '' the Poor Souls and saints for another Notre Dame touchdown . Shakespeare 's game - winning pass became known as the `` Hail Mary pass . '' In 1969 , the game was selected in a poll by the Associated Press as the `` game of the century '' , the best game in the first 100 years of college football . 1940 -- In 1940 , the Georgetown Hoyas football team and quarterback Joe McFadden used a play referred to as the `` ' Hail Mary ' pass . '' An Associated Press article published in December 1940 noted : `` A ' Hail Mary ' pass , in the talk of the Washington eleven , is one that is thrown with a prayer because the odds against completion are big .
