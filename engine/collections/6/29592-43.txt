Verwoerd argued that the Bantustans were the `` original homes '' of the black peoples of South Africa . In 1951 , the government of Daniel François Malan introduced the Bantu Authorities Act to establish `` homelands '' allocated to the country 's black ethnic groups . These amounted to 13 % of the country 's land , the remainder being reserved for the white population . The homelands were run by cooperative tribal leaders , while uncooperative chiefs were forcibly deposed . Over time , a ruling black élite emerged with a personal and financial interest in the preservation of the homelands . While this aided the homelands ' political stability to an extent , their position was still entirely dependent on South African support .
