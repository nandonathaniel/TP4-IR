The characters will sometimes break the fourth wall as well , especially Baby . An example of such is seen in the episode `` Nature Calls '' ( Season 3 , Episode 1 ) when Fran and Earl spell out words in front of Baby during an argument , who , after looking at the camera and saying `` This could get ugly '' , proceeds to spell out `` They think I ca n't spell '' with his alphabet blocks .
