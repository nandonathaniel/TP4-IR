In Rome , Italy , during the release of Piranha II : The Spawning , director Cameron fell ill and had a dream about a metallic torso holding kitchen knives dragging itself from an explosion . Inspired by director John Carpenter , who had made the slasher film Halloween ( 1978 ) on a low budget , Cameron used the dream as a `` launching pad '' to write a slasher - style film . Cameron 's agent disliked the Terminator concept and requested that he work on something else . After this , Cameron dismissed his agent .
