Despite their efforts , the Axis powers were unable to prevent the build - up of Allied invasion forces for the liberation of Europe . In November 1942 , at the height of the Atlantic campaign , the US Navy escorted the Operation Torch invasion fleet 3,000 mi ( 4,800 km ) across the Atlantic without hindrance , or even being detected . ( This may be the ultimate example of the Allied practise of evasive routing . ) In 1943 and 1944 the Allies transported some 3 million American and Allied servicemen across the Atlantic without significant loss . By 1945 the USN was able to wipe out in mid-Atlantic with little real difficulty a wolf - pack suspected of carrying V - weapons .
