On October 28 , 2014 , CBS launched CBS All Access , an over-the - top subscription streaming service -- priced at $5.99 USD per month ( $9.99 with an option for advertising - free streaming content ) -- which allows users to view past and present episodes of CBS shows . Announced on October 16 , 2014 ( one day after HBO announced the launch of its over-the - top service HBO Now ) , as the first OTT offering by an American broadcast television network , the service initially encompassed the network 's existing streaming portal at CBS.com and its mobile app for smartphones and tablet computers ; CBS All Access became available on Roku on April 7 , 2015 , and on Chromecast on May 14 , 2015 . In addition to providing full - length episodes of CBS programs , the service allows live programming streams of local CBS affiliates in 124 markets reaching 75 % of the United States ( including stations owned by Tribune Broadcasting , Sinclair Broadcast Group , Hearst Television , Tegna Media , Nexstar Media Group , Meredith Corporation , Griffin Communications , Raycom Media , Weigel Broadcasting and Cox Media Group and the launch group of CBS Television Stations ) , including SEC sports and the NFL ; however due to the absence of streaming rights , a few sports events are not streamed on the service ( mainly involving PGA Tour events , some locally programmed NFL preseason games , and select brokered shows through CBS Sports Spectacular ) , along with limited syndicated and paid programming where only a local broadcast license to carry the program is allowed and web airing rights are retained by the syndicator or infomercial producer . By the very nature of it being live , streaming of a local affiliate does include all advertising , even with the commercial - free plan .
