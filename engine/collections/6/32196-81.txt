Following the Lome Peace Agreement , the security situation in Sierra Leone was still unstable because many rebels refused to commit themselves to the peace process . The DDR camps were an attempt to convince the rebel forces to literally exchange their weapons for food , clothing , and shelter . During a six - week quarantine period , former combatants were taught basic skills that could be put to use in a peaceful profession after they return to society . After 2001 , DDR camps became increasingly effective and by 2002 they had collected over 45,000 weapons and hosted over 70,000 former combatants .
