The multiple access methods used in GSM with GPRS are based on frequency division duplex ( FDD ) and TDMA . During a session , a user is assigned to one pair of up - link and down - link frequency channels . This is combined with time domain statistical multiplexing which makes it possible for several users to share the same frequency channel . The packets have constant length , corresponding to a GSM time slot . The down - link uses first - come first - served packet scheduling , while the up - link uses a scheme very similar to reservation ALOHA ( R - ALOHA ) . This means that slotted ALOHA ( S - ALOHA ) is used for reservation inquiries during a contention phase , and then the actual data is transferred using dynamic TDMA with first - come first - served .
