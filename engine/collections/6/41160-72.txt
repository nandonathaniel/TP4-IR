Cases in state courts begin in a trial court where lawsuits and criminal cases are filed and evidence is eventually presented if a case proceeds to a hearing or trial . Trials in these courts are often held only after extensive pre-trial procedures that in more than 90 % of cases lead to a default judgment in a civil case , an agreed resolution settling the case or plea bargain resolving a criminal case , or pre-trial resolution of the case by a judge either on the merits or on procedural grounds . Territory outside of any state in the United States , such as the District of Columbia or American Samoa , often has a court system established under federal or territorial law which substitutes for a state court system and is distinct from the ordinary federal court system .
