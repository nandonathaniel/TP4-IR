The Rolling Stones are an English rock band formed in London , England in 1962 . The first stable line - up consisted of Brian Jones ( guitar , harmonica ) , Mick Jagger ( lead vocals ) , Keith Richards ( guitar , backing vocals ) , Bill Wyman ( bass ) , Charlie Watts ( drums ) , and Ian Stewart ( piano ) . Stewart was removed from the official line - up in 1963 but continued as a touring member until his death in 1985 . Jones left the band less than a month before his death in 1969 , having already been replaced by Mick Taylor , who remained until 1974 . After Taylor left the band , Ronnie Wood took his place in 1975 and has been on guitar in tandem with Richards ever since . Following Wyman 's departure in 1993 , Darryl Jones joined as their touring bassist . Touring keyboardists for the band have been Nicky Hopkins ( 1967 -- 1982 ) , Ian McLagan ( 1978 -- 1981 ) , Billy Preston ( through the mid-1970s ) and Chuck Leavell ( 1982 -- present ) . The band was first led by Brian Jones , but after developing into the band 's songwriters , Jagger and Richards assumed leadership when Jones was dealing with personal troubles and legal issues .
