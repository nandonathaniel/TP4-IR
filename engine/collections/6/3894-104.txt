The first calls to restrict advertising came in 1962 from the Royal College of Physicians , who highlighted the health problems and recommended stricter laws on the sale and advertising of tobacco products . In 1971 , an agreement between the government and the tobacco industry saw the inclusion of health warnings on all cigarette packets . All television commercials for cigarettes were banned on 1 August 1965 , although commercials for loose tobacco and cigars continued until 1991 .
