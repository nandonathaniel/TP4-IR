The vast majority of high school football games are scheduled on Friday nights , with Thursday evenings and Saturdays being less heavily used . Alternate days are most common in larger school districts where the facilities are used by multiple schools , or where the playing field is not illuminated for nighttime use due to financial limitations , local regulations , or neighborhood opposition against night games .
