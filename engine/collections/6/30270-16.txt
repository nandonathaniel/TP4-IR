Although the show is set in a post-apocalyptic setting , according to Ward , the original intention was for the Land of Ooo to simply be `` magical '' . After making the episode `` Business Time '' , in which an iceberg containing the bodies of reanimated business men floats to the surface of a lake , the show suddenly became post-apocalyptic , and Ward noted that the production crew `` just ran with it . '' Ward later described the setting as `` candyland on the surface and dark underneath '' .
