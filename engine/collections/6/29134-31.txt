Expansion into France began with shops opening in Paris at Boulevard Haussmann and Lyon in 1975 , followed by a second Paris shop at Rosny 2 in 1977 . Further expansion into other French and Belgian cities followed into the 1980s . Although the Paris shops remained popular and profitable , the Western European operation as a whole did not fare as well and eighteen shops were sold in 2001 . However , in April 2011 , M&S changed directions again with an announcement to reopen a store that will not only sell clothing but food as well . In addition the group will also open several food outlets throughout the French capital . The first branch opened on 24 November 2011 at the Champs - Élysées in a ceremony attended by the company 's CEO Marc Bolland , the model Rosie Huntington - Whiteley and the British Ambassador to France , Sir Peter Westmacott . The Daily Mail reported that 1,000 customers queued outside for over 2 hours at the opening of the 1,400 m ( 15,000 sq ft ) store .
