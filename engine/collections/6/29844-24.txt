The original logo resembled a deformed radiation warning symbol . Controversially , the original name for the DirectX project was the `` Manhattan Project '' , a reference to the US nuclear weapons initiative . Alex St. John , head of Microsoft DirectX evangelism at the time , claims that the connotation of the ultimate outcome of the Manhattan Project ( the nuclear bombing of Japan ) is intentional , and that DirectX and its sister project , the Xbox ( which shares a similar logo ) , were meant to displace Japanese videogame - makers from their dominance of the video - game industry . However , Microsoft publicly denies this account , instead claiming that the logo is merely an artistic design .
