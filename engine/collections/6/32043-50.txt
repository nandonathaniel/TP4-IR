The Jefferson quotation cited in Black 's opinion is from a letter Jefferson wrote in 1802 to the Baptists of Danbury , Connecticut , that there should be `` a wall of separation between church and state . '' Critics of Black 's reasoning ( most notably , former Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist ) have argued that the majority of states did have `` official '' churches at the time of the First Amendment 's adoption and that James Madison , not Jefferson , was the principal drafter . However , Madison himself often wrote of `` perfect separation between the ecclesiastical and civil matters '' ( 1822 letter to Livingston ) , which means the authority of the church ( that which comes from the church ) is decided by church authority , and that which is decided in civil government is decided by civil authorities ; neither may decree law or policy in each other 's realm . Another description reads : `` line of separation between the rights of religion and the civil authority ... entire abstinence of the government '' ( 1832 letter Rev. Adams ) , and `` practical distinction between Religion and Civil Government as essential to the purity of both , and as guaranteed by the Constitution of the United States '' ( 1811 letter to Baptist Churches ) .
