Since 2012 , a growing protest and advocacy movement called `` Fight for $15 '' , initially growing out of fast food worker strikes , has advocated for an increase in the minimum wage to a living wage . Since the start of these protests , a number of states and cities have increased their minimum wage . In 2014 Connecticut for instance passed legislation to raise the minimum wage from $8.70 to $10.10 per hour by 2017 , making it one of about six states at the time to aim at or above $10.00 per hour . In 2014 and 2015 , several cities , including San Francisco , Seattle , Los Angeles , and Washington D.C. passed ordinances that gradually increase the minimum wage to $15.00 per hour . In 2016 New York and California became the first states to pass legislation that would gradually raise the minimum wage to $15 per hour in each state .
