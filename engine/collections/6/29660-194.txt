Both the LCA and the ALHR submissions expressed concern about s 187C ( 3 ) , which allows a service provider to keep information or a document for a period longer than the two - year data retention period . Furthermore , once data is accessed by a law enforcement agency , there is no obligation upon it to destroy it in a timely manner even when it is irrelevant to the agency or no longer needed . The LCA made two recommendations - first , that the views of the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner should be obtained to determine whether the current APPs and the proposed Telecommunications Service Sector Security Reform ( TSSR ) relating to the destruction of telecommunications data by service providers is sufficient to safeguard personal information , and , second , that the Bill should be amended to require law enforcement and security agencies to de-identify or put beyond use in a timely manner , data containing ' personal ' information which is no longer relevant or needed for the agencies purposes .
