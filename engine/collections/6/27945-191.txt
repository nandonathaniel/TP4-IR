In Mexico , to show affection and appreciation to the mother , it is traditional to start the celebration with the famous song `` Las Ma√±anitas '' , either a cappella , with the help of a mariachi or a contracted trio . Many families usually gather to celebrate this special day trying to spend as much time as possible with mothers to honor them on their day . They are organized to bring some dishes and eat all together or maybe to visit any restaurant .
