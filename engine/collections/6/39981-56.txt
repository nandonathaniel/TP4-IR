Thomas Jefferson and James Madison opposed a strong central government ( and , consequently , most of Hamilton 's economic policies ) , but they could not stop Hamilton , who wielded immense power and political clout in the Washington administration . In 1801 , however , Jefferson became president and turned to promoting a more decentralized , agrarian democracy called Jeffersonian democracy . ( He based his philosophy on protecting the common man from political and economic tyranny . He particularly praised small farmers as `` the most valuable citizens '' . ) However , Jefferson did not change Hamilton 's basic policies . As president in 1811 Madison let the bank charter expire , but the War of 1812 proved the need for a national bank and Madison reversed positions . The Second Bank of the United States was established in 1816 , with a 20 - year charter .
