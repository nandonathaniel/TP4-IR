The basic shape of the church has a mixture of Italian and Byzantine features , notably `` the treatment of the eastern arm as the termination of a basilican building with main apse and two side chapels rather than as an equal arm of a truly centralized structure '' . In the first half of the 13th century the narthex and the new facade were constructed , most of the mosaics were completed and the domes were covered with second much higher domes of lead - covered wood in order to blend in with the Gothic architecture of the redesigned Doge 's Palace. --
