According to the Book of Exodus , God instructed Moses on Mount Sinai during his 40 - day stay upon the mountain within the thick cloud and darkness where God was and he was shown the pattern for the tabernacle and furnishings of the Ark to be made of shittim wood to house the Tablets of Stone . Moses instructed Bezalel and Oholiab to construct the Ark . In Deuteronomy , however , the Ark is said to have been built specifically by Moses himself without reference of Bezalel or Oholiab .
