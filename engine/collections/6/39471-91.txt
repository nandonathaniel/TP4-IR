Electronics rose to prominence quickly in World War II . The British developed and progressed electronic computers which were primarily used for breaking the `` Enigma '' codes , which were Nazi secret codes . These codes for radio messages were indecipherable to the Allies . However , the meticulous work of code breakers based at Britain 's Bletchley Park cracked the secrets of German wartime communication , and played a crucial role in the final defeat of Germany . Americans also used electronic computers for equations , such as battlefield equations , ballistics , and more . Numerous small digital computers were also used . From calculating tables , to mechanical trajectory calculators , to some of the most advanced electronic computers . Soldiers would usually carry most of the electronic devices in their pockets , but since technology has developed , digital computers started to increase in size , which spacious command and control centres would have . Initial control centers that were embarked on ships and aircraft that established the networked computing , is so essential to our daily lives . While prior to the war few electronic devices were seen as important pieces of equipment , by the middle of the war instruments such as radar and ASDIC ( sonar ) had become invaluable . Germany started the war ahead in some aspects of radar , but lost ground to research and development of the cavity magnetron in Britain and to later work at the `` Radiation Laboratory '' of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology . Half of the German theoretical physicists were Jewish and had emigrated or otherwise been lost to Germany long before WW II started .
