Federation occurred on 1 January 1901 , but elections for the first parliament were not scheduled until late March . In the interim , an unelected caretaker government was necessary . In what is now known as the Hopetoun Blunder , the governor - general , Lord Hopetoun , invited Sir William Lyne , the premier of the most populous state , New South Wales , to form a government . Lyne was unable to do so and returned his commission in favour of Edmund Barton , who became the first Prime Minister and led the inaugural government into and beyond the election .
