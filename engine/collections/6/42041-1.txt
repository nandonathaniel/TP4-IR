In 1997 , Nike commenced production of its own line of skate shoes , but was unable to sell to many specialist skate shops , as the market was already strongly in favour of companies such as DC , Globe , eS Footwear , Emerica , and Vans ; Nike was not considered a core skateboarding brand among the skateboarding community and , therefore , did not receive the necessary level of support .
