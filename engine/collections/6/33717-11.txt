By restricting flight , wing clipping may help prevent indoor birds from risking injury from ceiling fans or flying into large windows . But there is no evidence to show that clipped birds are safer than full - winged ones , only that clipped birds are subject to different kinds of accidents than full - winged birds . Social pet birds ( such as parrots ) may also be clipped both to restrict independence and in attempts to make them tamer and easier to manage in order to encourage them to socialize with their owners ; some parrots that show aggression to certain people or other birds may be clipped to prevent attack . However , birds can be trained to accept flight requests or ' commands ' and this removes the need for wing - clipping ( Glendell 2007 ) .
