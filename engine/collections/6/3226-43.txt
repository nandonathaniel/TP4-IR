Swift gathering at `` Squad U '' was also said to be a reply to the media dubbing her close friends as a `` squad '' . During the second chorus , Swift can be seen with eight men , each of which revealed an `` I Heart TS '' crop top after unbuttoning a jacket . This scene is an apparent tribute to her ex-boyfriend Tom Hiddleston , who was seen wearing an `` I Heart TS '' tank top when they were a couple . The eight backup dancers may also have been a possible reference to the idea that Swift has had eight ex-boyfriends during her career . Swift was also seen standing on a pile of her other iterations , reiterating the idea that she is leaving her past self behind . The shirt that an iteration of Swift wore in the `` You Belong with Me '' video was also different , with her close friends ' names scribbled on it this time .
