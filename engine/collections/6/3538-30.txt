Williams and O'Hara were among very few of the positive contemporary reviews , while negative reviews appeared in more than 150 publications . Critics claimed the novel was too emotional , had inferior prose and a `` static plot '' , and that Cantwell was an `` avatar '' for Hemingway 's character Nick Adams . The novel was also criticized for being an unsuitable autobiography , and for presenting Cantwell as a bitter soldier .
