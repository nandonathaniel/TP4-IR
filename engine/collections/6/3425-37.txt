The creator of the Spartan system of rule was the legendary lawgiver Lycurgus . He is associated with the drastic reforms that were instituted in Sparta after the revolt of the helots in the second half of the 7th century BCE . In order to prevent another helot revolt , Lycurgus devised the highly militarized communal system that made Sparta unique among the city - states of Greece . All his reforms were directed towards the three Spartan virtues : equality ( among citizens ) , military fitness , and austerity . It is also probable that Lycurgus delineated the powers of the two traditional organs of the Spartan government , the gerousia and the apella .
