The magister militum in the Diocese of Africa declared for the East and stopped the supply of grain to Rome . Italy had not fed itself for centuries and could not do so now . In 398 , Stilicho sent his last reserves , a few thousand men , to re-take the Diocese of Africa , and he strengthened his position further when he married his daughter Maria to Honorius . Throughout this period Stilicho , and all other generals , were desperately short of recruits and supplies for them . In 400 , Stilicho was charged to press into service any `` laetus , Alamannus , Sarmatian , vagrant , son of a veteran '' or any other person liable to serve . He had reached the bottom of his recruitment pool . Though personally not corrupt , he was very active in confiscating assets ; the financial and administrative machine was not producing enough support for the army .
