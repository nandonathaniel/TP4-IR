None of the surface features on Jupiter 's moons would appear as prominent as the lunar maria do when the Moon is viewed from Earth . Dark and light patches would be visible on Io 's surface due to the coloration of sulfur that covers Io , and the largest volcanoes would be designated by dark points , but the lack of large , contrasting features results in a poor view of it . Europa , however , would appear as a completely featureless white disc . Even when viewed from nearby , most spacecraft images use contrast enhancements to clearly show the cracks in the Europan ice , which are only about 10 -- 15 percent darker than the rest of the surface . Vague dark and light patches would be visible on Ganymede , whereas Callisto is much too distant for any features to be made out .
