Noted soccer organizations and players have rented space or lived in Trump Tower . CONCACAF , the governing body of association football in North and Central America and the Caribbean , occupies the entire 17th floor . Chuck Blazer , the former president of CONCACAF , used to live in two apartments on the 49th floor . One of these apartments , a $6,000 - per - month suite , was occupied mainly by his cats , while Blazer lived in an adjoining $18,000 - per - month apartment . The apartments and office space were described as part of an `` extravagant '' lifestyle that ultimately resulted in Blazer being apprehended and becoming an FBI informant in a corruption investigation against association soccer organizations worldwide , including CONCACAF and FIFA . Another noted soccer figure living in Trump Tower is Jos√© Maria Marin , former president of the Brazilian Football Confederation , who is currently under house arrest in his apartment for FIFA - related corruption charges . As well , Portuguese footballer Cristiano Ronaldo bought an $18.5 million apartment in the tower in August 2015 and planned to buy another $23 million apartment in 2016 .
