AMF Bowling entered Chapter 11 bankruptcy for the first time in April 2001 , stating that it had `` overextended itself by acquiring 260 additional bowling centers that it had struggled to manage , '' and that the demand for bowling products had decreased . Private equity firm Code Hennessy & Simmons bought the company in 2004 for $670 million to bring it out of bankruptcy . The transaction was financed in part by a $254 million sale and lease - back of 186 bowling centers to iStar Financial . Shortly after , the company began shedding its `` non-core , foreign assets '' to focus on improving the operations of its remaining centers . Fred Hipp , the former California Pizza Kitchen top executive who became President and CEO in 2004 , said the strategy would now be to `` bring as much focus as possible to the management of our core U.S. center and bowling products businesses . '' In 2005 , AMF Bowling 's products division and Italian - based Qubica Worldwide formed a 50 / 50 joint venture , QubicaAMF Worldwide .
