Sir Gawain and the Green Knight ( Middle English : Sir Gawayn and þe Grene Knyȝt ) is a late 14th - century Middle English chivalric romance . It is one of the best known Arthurian stories , with its plot combining two types of folklore motifs , the beheading game and the exchange of winnings . The Green Knight is interpreted by some as a representation of the Green Man of folklore and by others as an allusion to Christ . Written in stanzas of alliterative verse , each of which ends in a rhyming bob and wheel , it draws on Welsh , Irish , and English stories , as well as the French chivalric tradition . It is an important poem in the romance genre , which typically involves a hero who goes on a quest which tests his prowess , and it remains popular to this day in modern English renderings from J.R.R. Tolkien , Simon Armitage , and others , as well as through film and stage adaptations .
