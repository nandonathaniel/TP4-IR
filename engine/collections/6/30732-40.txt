On October 5 , 2017 , Joe Belfiore announced that Microsoft was working on a version of Edge for Android and iOS . A feature - limited beta version for iOS was also made available but the Android version , at the time of the announcement , was not available . According to Mary Jo Foley , these versions are not a full port of Microsoft Edge , but just its look and feel ; Edge would not use the EdgeHTML layout engine , but rather the iOS 's Webkit and the Android 's Blink engine .
