The ignition system used in the Model T was an unusual trembler coil system to drive the spark plugs , as used for stationary gas engines , rather than the expensive magnetos that were used on other cars . This ignition also made the Model T more flexible as to the quality or type of fuel it used . The need for a starting battery and also Ford 's use of an unusual AC alternator located inside the flywheel housing encouraged the adoption of electric lighting ( standard fitment as of 1915 ) , rather than oil or acetylene lamps , but it also delayed the adoption of electric starting , which was not offered until 1919 . The Model T engine was produced for replacement needs , as well as stationary and marine applications until 1941 , well after production of the Model T had ended . It was also utilized in the drivetrain of the Fordson tractor , which was produced in the US until 1928 , and in Ireland until 1964 .
