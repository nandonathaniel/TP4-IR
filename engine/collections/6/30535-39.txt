Ralph Houk was chosen to replace Stengel . During the 1961 season , both Mantle and Maris chased Ruth 's single - season home run record of 60 , and the pair attracted much press attention as the year progressed . Ultimately , an infection forced Mantle to leave the lineup and bow out of the race in mid-September with 54 home runs . Maris continued , though , and on October 1 , the final day of the season , he homered against Red Sox pitcher Tracy Stallard into the right field stands of Yankee Stadium , breaking the record with 61 . Commissioner Ford Frick decreed that two separate records be kept , as the Yankees played a 154 - game schedule in 1927 ( beginning in 1961 , AL teams played 162 games to accommodate the league 's expansion to 10 teams ) . MLB did away with the dual records 30 years later , giving Maris sole possession of the single - season home run record before it was broken in 1998 by Mark McGwire . The Yankees won the pennant with 109 regular season wins , at the time the club 's second - highest single - season total , and defeated the Cincinnati Reds in five games to win the franchise 's 19th World Series . The team hit 240 home runs to break the MLB single - season record . Maris won another AL MVP Award , while Whitey Ford captured the Cy Young Award , having posted a 25 -- 4 record . The team gained a reputation as one of the strongest the Yankees had fielded , along with the 1927 and 1939 Yankees . New York returned to the World Series in 1962 , facing the San Francisco Giants . After exchanging victories in the first six games of the Series , the Yankees won the decisive seventh game 1 -- 0 to clinch the title .
