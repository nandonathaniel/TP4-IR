Human 's attention on words is impacted by emotion grasping vocabulary . Negative and positive words are better recalled than neutral words that are spoken . Many different ways that attention is focused on hearing what the speaker has to say is the inflection of the presenter 's voice in a sad , content , frustrated sound or in the use of words that are close to the hear . A study was conducted to observe if the use of emotional vocabulary was a key receptor of recall memory . The groups were put into the same lecture halls and given the same speakers , but the results came back to determine that the inflection and word choice recalled by the listeners concluded that emotional words , phrases , and sounds are more memorable than neutral speakers .
