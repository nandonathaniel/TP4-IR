The Bears ' rivalry with the Green Bay Packers is one of the oldest and most storied in American professional sports , dating back to 1921 ( the Green Bay Packers were an independent team until they joined the NFL in 1921 ) . In one infamous incident that year , Halas got the Packers expelled from the league in order to prevent their signing a particular player , and then graciously got them re-admitted after the Bears had closed the deal with that player .
