The New York metropolitan area is home to a prominent self - identifying gay and bisexual community estimated at nearly 570,000 individuals , the largest in the United States and one of the world 's largest . Same - sex marriages in New York were legalized on June 24 , 2011 and were authorized to take place beginning 30 days thereafter . Charles Kaiser , author of The Gay Metropolis : The Landmark History of Gay Life in America , wrote that in the era after World War II , `` New York City became the literal gay metropolis for hundreds of thousands of immigrants from within and without the United States : the place they chose to learn how to live openly , honestly and without shame . '' The annual New York City Pride March ( or gay pride parade ) traverses southward down Fifth Avenue and ends at Greenwich Village in Lower Manhattan ; the parade rivals the Sao Paulo Gay Pride Parade as the largest pride parade in the world , attracting tens of thousands of participants and millions of sidewalk spectators each June .
