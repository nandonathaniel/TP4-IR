Underscoring its commitment , the Preparedness movement set up and funded its own summer training camps at Plattsburgh , New York , and other sites , where 40,000 college alumni became physically fit , learned to march and shoot , and ultimately provided the cadre of a wartime officer corps . Suggestions by labor unions that talented working - class youth be invited to Plattsburgh were ignored . The Preparedness movement was distant not only from the working classes but also from the middle - class leadership of most of small - town America . It had had little use for the National Guard , which it saw as politicized , localistic , poorly armed , ill trained , too inclined to idealistic crusading ( as against Spain in 1898 ) , and too lacking in understanding of world affairs . The National Guard on the other hand was securely rooted in state and local politics , with representation from a very broad cross section of American society . The Guard was one of the nation 's few institutions that ( in some northern states ) accepted blacks on an equal footing .
