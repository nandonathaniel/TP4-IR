The anticipated success failed to materialise , partly because Richmond allowed the coaching position to again become unstable . With over a year still to run on his contract , John Northey demanded a contract extension that the club refused . This was because of a rumour that some people with an association with the club were pursuing Essendon coach and former Richmond premiership player Kevin Sheedy . So Northey walked out on Richmond and accepted a longer - term contract to coach the Brisbane Bears . Richmond , caught short , appointed the Bears ' ex-coach Robert Walls for 1996 . After several humiliating thrashings in 1997 , Robert Walls became the first Richmond coach to be sacked mid-season . After two - and - a-half seasons under Jeff Gieschen , the club appointed ex-St Kilda captain Danny Frawley . After a Preliminary Final appearance in Frawley 's second season , Richmond overestimated the strength of the list and settled for trading for established players rather than drafting youth . Over the next three seasons , the team managed just 18 wins . The administration continued to support Frawley and ensured that he would see out his contract , a far cry from the way many of his predecessors were treated . However , midway through the 2004 season ( a season in which Richmond only managed 4 wins , and lost their last 14 H&A matches ) , Frawley announced he would be relinquishing his role as Richmond coach at seasons ' end .
