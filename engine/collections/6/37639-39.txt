The Andean region cuts across several natural and floristic regions due to its extension from Caribbean Venezuela to cold , windy and wet Cape Horn passing through the hyperarid Atacama Desert . Rainforests and tropical dry forests used to encircle much of the northern Andes but are now greatly diminished , especially in the Choc√≥ and inter-Andean valleys of Colombia . As a direct opposite of the humid Andean slopes are the relatively dry Andean slopes in most of western Peru , Chile and Argentina . Along with several Interandean Valles , they are typically dominated by deciduous woodland , shrub and xeric vegetation , reaching the extreme in the slopes near the virtually lifeless Atacama Desert .
