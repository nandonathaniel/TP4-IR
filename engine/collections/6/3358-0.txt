In statistics , the standard deviation ( SD , also represented by the Greek letter sigma Ïƒ or the Latin letter s ) is a measure that is used to quantify the amount of variation or dispersion of a set of data values . A low standard deviation indicates that the data points tend to be close to the mean ( also called the expected value ) of the set , while a high standard deviation indicates that the data points are spread out over a wider range of values .
