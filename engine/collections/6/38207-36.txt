Infrared ( IR ) light is electromagnetic radiation with a wavelength between 0.7 and 300 micrometers , which corresponds to a frequency range between 430 and 1 THz respectively . IR wavelengths are longer than that of visible light , but shorter than that of microwaves . Infrared may be detected at a distance from the radiating objects by `` feel . '' Infrared sensing snakes can detect and focus infrared by use of a pinhole lens in their heads , called `` pits '' . Bright sunlight provides an irradiance of just over 1 kilowatt per square meter at sea level . Of this energy , 53 % is infrared radiation , 44 % is visible light , and 3 % is ultraviolet radiation .
