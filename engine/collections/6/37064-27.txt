In the late 17th century , Gottfried Leibniz proposed the idea of the Latin : vis viva , or living force , which defined as the product of the mass of an object and its velocity squared ; he believed that total vis viva was conserved . To account for slowing due to friction , Leibniz theorized that thermal energy consisted of the random motion of the constituent parts of matter , although it would be more than a century until this was generally accepted . The modern analog of this property , kinetic energy , differs from vis viva only by a factor of two .
