The season premiere was originally supposed to have been written by series creator Chris Carter . In his initial pitch , Mulder would have been sent to Moscow . In fact , the producers wanted to film the episode in Russia , but they were not able to secure the appropriate arrangements . In the end , Carter was unable to complete the script idea , which would have also featured the reopening of the X-Files . Instead , co-executive producers Glen Morgan , James Wong and Howard Gordon penned the opening premiere , `` Little Green Men '' ; the episode was the first entry to actually show an alien in the series . This delay gave Carter time to write `` Duane Barry '' , the start of the first two - parter and also the entry wherein the X-Files are re-opened .
