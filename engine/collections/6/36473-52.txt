Charles Ives 's symphonic poem Decoration Day depicted the holiday as he experienced it in his childhood , with his father 's band leading the way to the town cemetery , the playing of `` Taps '' on a trumpet , and a livelier march tune on the way back to the town . It is frequently played with three other Ives works based on holidays , as the second movement of A Symphony : New England Holidays .
