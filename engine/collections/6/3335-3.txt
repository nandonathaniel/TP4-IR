State Phase Abbreviation Description Resting Gap 0 A phase where the cell has left the cycle and has stopped dividing . Interphase Gap 1 Cells increase in size in Gap 1 . The G checkpoint control mechanism ensures that everything is ready for DNA synthesis . Synthesis DNA replication occurs during this phase . Gap 2 During the gap between DNA synthesis and mitosis , the cell will continue to grow . The G checkpoint control mechanism ensures that everything is ready to enter the M ( mitosis ) phase and divide . Cell division Mitosis Cell growth stops at this stage and cellular energy is focused on the orderly division into two daughter cells . A checkpoint in the middle of mitosis ( Metaphase Checkpoint ) ensures that the cell is ready to complete cell division .
