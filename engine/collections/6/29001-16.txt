In a conductor ( ACSR and other types ) carrying AC current , if currents are flowing through one or more other nearby conductors the distribution of current within each conductor will be constrained to smaller regions . The resulting current crowding is termed as the proximity effect . This crowding gives an increase in the effective AC resistance of the circuit , with the effect at 60 Hertz being greater than at 50 Hertz . Geometry , conductivity , and frequency are factors in determining the amount of proximity effect .
