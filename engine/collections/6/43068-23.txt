A simple inductive argument shows that the carry can never exceed n and the total sum for r can never exceed D * n : the carry into the first column is zero , and for all other columns , there are at most n digits in the column , and a carry of at most n from the previous column ( by the induction hypothesis ) . The sum is at most D * n , and the carry to the next column is at most D * n / D , or n . Thus both these values can be stored in O ( log n ) digits .
