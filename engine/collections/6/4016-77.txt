`` A method and apparatus for modifying the curvature of a live cornea via use of an excimer laser . The live cornea has a thin layer removed therefrom , leaving an exposed internal surface thereon . Then , either the surface or thin layer is exposed to the laser beam along a predetermined pattern to ablate desired portions . The thin layer is then replaced onto the surface . Ablating a central area of the surface or thin layer makes the cornea less curved , while ablating an annular area spaced from the center of the surface or layer makes the cornea more curved . The desired predetermined pattern is formed by use of a variable diaphragm , a rotating orifice of variable size , a movable mirror or a movable fiber optic cable through which the laser beam is directed towards the exposed internal surface or removed thin layer .
