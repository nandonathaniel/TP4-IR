A vanishing point is a point on the image plane of a perspective drawing where the two - dimensional perspective projections ( or drawings ) of mutually parallel lines in three - dimensional space appear to converge . When the set of parallel lines is perpendicular to a picture plane , the construction is known as one - point perspective , and their vanishing point corresponds to the oculus , or `` eye point '' , from which the image should be viewed for correct perspective geometry . Traditional linear drawings use objects with one to three sets of parallels , defining one to three vanishing points .
