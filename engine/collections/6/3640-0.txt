A river delta is a landform that forms from deposition of sediment carried by a river as the flow leaves its mouth and enters slower - moving or stagnant water . This occurs where a river enters an ocean , sea , estuary , lake , reservoir , or ( more rarely ) another river that can not transport away the supplied sediment . The size and shape of a delta is controlled by the balance between watershed processes that supply sediment and receiving basin processes that redistribute , sequester , and export that sediment . The size , geometry , and location of the receiving basin also plays an important role in delta evolution . River deltas are important in human civilization , as they are major agricultural production centers and population centers . They can provide coastline defense and can impact drinking water supply . They are also ecologically important , with different species assemblages depending on their landscape position .
