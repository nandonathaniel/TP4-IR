The god of nighttime lightning has been interpreted as an aspect of Jupiter , either a chthonic manifestation of the god or a separate god of the underworld . A statue of Summanus stood on the roof of the Temple of Capitoline Jupiter , and Iuppiter Summanus is one of the epithets of Jupiter . Dum√©zil sees the opposition Dius Fidius versus Summanus as complementary , interpreting it as typical to the inherent ambiguity of the sovereign god exemplified by that of Mitra and Varuna in Vedic religion . The complementarity of the epithets is shown in inscriptions found on puteals or bidentals reciting either fulgur Dium conditum or fulgur Summanum conditum in places struck by daytime versus nighttime lightning bolts respectively . This is also consistent with the etymology of Summanus , deriving from sub and mane ( the time before morning ) .
