As RNA integrity has long been known to be a problem in molecular biology studies , there are a few methods that have been used historically to determine the integrity of RNA . The most popular has long been agarose gel electrophoresis with ethidium bromide staining , allowing one to visualize the bands from the rRNA peaks . The height of the 28S and 18S bands can be compared to each other , with a 2 : 1 ratio indicating non-degraded RNA . While this method is very cheap and easy , there are several issues with this method , primarily its subjectivity , leading to inconsistent , non-standardized RNA quality assessments , and the large amounts of RNA that are needed to visualize it on an agarose gel , which can be problematic if there is not much RNA to work with . There are also a number of different problems that can arise from agarose gel electrophoresis , such as poor loading , uneven running , and uneven staining that lead to increased variability in the accuracy of using agarose gel electrophoresis to determine RNA integrity . Clearly , a standardized , repeatable , objective method of determining RNA integrity was needed .
