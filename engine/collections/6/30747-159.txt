As the power shifted from the Umayyads to the Abbasids , the architecture styles changed also . The Christian styles evolved into a style based more on the Sasanian Empire utilizing mud bricks and baked bricks with carved stucco . Another major development was the creation or vast enlargement of cities as they were turned into the capital of the empire . First , starting with the creation of Baghdad , starting in 762 , which was planned as a walled city with a mosque and palace in the center . The walls were to have four gates to exit the city . Al - Mansur , who was responsible for the creation of Baghdad , also planned the city of Raqqa , along the Euphrates . Finally , in 836 , al - Mu'tasim moved the capital to a new site that he created along the Tigris , called Samarra . This city saw 60 years of work , with race - courses and game preserves to add to the atmosphere . Due to the dry remote nature of the environment , some of the palaces built in this era were isolated havens . Al - Ukhaidir Fortress is a fine example of this type of building which has stables , living quarters , and a mosque , all surrounding inner courtyards . Other mosques of this era , such as the Mosque of Ibn Tulun , in Cairo , and the Great Mosque of Kairouan in Tunisia while ultimately built during the Umayyad dynasty , it was substantially renovated in the 9th century . This renovation was so extensive as to ostensibly be a rebuild , was in the furthest reaches of the Muslim world , in an area that the Aghlabids controlled ; however the styles utilized were mainly of the Abbasids . Mesopotamia only has one surviving mausoleum from this era , in Samarra . This octagonal dome is the final resting place of al - Muntasir . Other architectural innovations and styles were few , such as the four - centered arch , and a dome erected on squinches . Unfortunately , much was lost due to the ephemeral nature of the stucco and luster tiles .
