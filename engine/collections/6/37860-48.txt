Ada saw something that Babbage in some sense failed to see . In Babbage 's world his engines were bound by number ... What Lovelace saw -- what Ada Byron saw -- was that number could represent entities other than quantity . So once you had a machine for manipulating numbers , if those numbers represented other things , letters , musical notes , then the machine could manipulate symbols of which number was one instance , according to rules . It is this fundamental transition from a machine which is a number cruncher to a machine for manipulating symbols according to rules that is the fundamental transition from calculation to computation -- to general - purpose computation -- and looking back from the present high ground of modern computing , if we are looking and sifting history for that transition , then that transition was made explicitly by Ada in that 1843 paper .
