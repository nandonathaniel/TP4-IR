Although majorities in both parties voted for the bill , there were notable exceptions . Though he opposed forced segregation , Republican Senator Barry Goldwater of Arizona voted against the bill , remarking , `` You ca n't legislate morality . '' Goldwater had supported previous attempts to pass civil rights legislation in 1957 and 1960 as well as the 24th Amendment outlawing the poll tax . He stated that the reason for his opposition to the 1964 bill was Title II , which in his opinion violated individual liberty and states ' rights . Democrats and Republicans from the Southern states opposed the bill and led an unsuccessful 83 - day filibuster , including Senators Albert Gore , Sr. ( D - TN ) and J. William Fulbright ( D - AR ) , as well as Senator Robert Byrd ( D - WV ) , who personally filibustered for 14 hours straight .
