Language learners often produce errors of syntax , vocabulary , and pronunciation thought to result from the influence of their L1 , such as mapping its grammatical patterns inappropriately onto the L2 , pronouncing certain sounds incorrectly or with difficulty , and confusing items of vocabulary known as false friends . This is known as L1 transfer or `` language interference '' . However , these transfer effects are typically stronger for beginners ' language production , and SLA research has highlighted many errors which can not be attributed to the L1 , as they are attested in learners of many language backgrounds ( for example , failure to apply 3rd person present singular - s to verbs , as in ' he make ' not ' he makes ' ) .
