The Indian rebellion was fed by resentments born of diverse perceptions , including invasive British - style social reforms , harsh land taxes , summary treatment of some rich landowners and princes , as well as scepticism about the improvements brought about by British rule . Many Indians did rise against the British , however , very many also fought for the British , and the majority remained seemingly compliant to British rule . Violence , which sometimes betrayed exceptional cruelty , was inflicted on both sides , on British officers , and civilians , including women and children , by the rebels , and on the rebels , and their supporters , including sometimes entire villages , by British reprisals ; the cities of Delhi and Lucknow were laid waste in the fighting and the British retaliation .
