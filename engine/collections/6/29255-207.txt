At the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro in 1992 , most of the world 's governments adopted a program for action under the auspices of the United Nations Agenda 21 , which included an Official Development Assistance ( ODA ) aid target of 0.7 % of gross national product ( GNP ) for rich nations , specified as roughly 22 members of the OECD and known as the Development Assistance Committee ( DAC ) . However , most countries do not adhere to this target , as the OECD 's table indicates that the DAC average ODA in 2011 was 0.31 % of GNP . The U.S. figure for 2011 was 0.20 % of GNP , which still left the U.S. as the largest single source of ODA among individual countries .
