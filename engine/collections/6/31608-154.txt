A particularly severe penalty applies where federal income tax withholding and Social Security taxes are not paid to the IRS . The penalty of up to 100 % of the amount not paid can be assessed against the employer entity as well as any person ( such as a corporate officer ) having control or custody of the funds from which payment should have been made .
