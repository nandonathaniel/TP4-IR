Davy also experimented with gases by inhaling them . This experimental procedure nearly proved fatal on several occasions , but led to the discovery of the unusual effects of nitrous oxide , which came to be known as laughing gas . Chlorine was discovered in 1774 by Swedish chemist Carl Wilhelm Scheele , who called it `` dephlogisticated marine acid '' ( see phlogiston theory ) and mistakenly thought it contained oxygen . Scheele observed several properties of chlorine gas , such as its bleaching effect on litmus , its deadly effect on insects , its yellow - green colour , and the similarity of its smell to that of aqua regia . However , Scheele was unable to publish his findings at the time . In 1810 , chlorine was given its current name by Humphry Davy ( derived from the Greek word for green ) , who insisted that chlorine was in fact an element . He also showed that oxygen could not be obtained from the substance known as oxymuriatic acid ( HCl solution ) . This discovery overturned Lavoisier 's definition of acids as compounds of oxygen . Davy was a popular lecturer and able experimenter .
