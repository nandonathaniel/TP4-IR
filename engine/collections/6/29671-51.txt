During the early 13th century Khwarezmia was invaded by the early Mongol Empire . The Mongol ruler Genghis Khan had the once vibrant cities of Bukhara and Samarkand burned to the ground after besieging them . However , in 1370 Samarkand saw a revival as the capital of the new Timurid Empire . The Turko - Mongol ruler Timur forcefully moved artisans and intellectuals from across Asia to Samarkand , making it one of the most important trade centers and cultural entrep√¥ts of the Islamic world .
