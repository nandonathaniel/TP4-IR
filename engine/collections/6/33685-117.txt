All these genres were highly fluid . A cross between a sirventes and a canso was a meg - sirventes ( half - sirventes ) . A tenso could be `` invented '' by a single poet ; an alba or canso could be written with religious significance , addressed to God or the Virgin ; and a sirventes may be nothing more than a political attack . The maldit and the comiat were often connected as a maldit - comiat and they could be used to attack and renounce a figure other than a lady or a lover , like a commanding officer ( when combined , in a way , with the sirventes ) .
