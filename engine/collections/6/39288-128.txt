The character was not devoid of criticism . Charlotte O'Sullivan from the London Evening Standard gave a more negative assessment of Elsa , saying that she `` resembles one of those brittle mentors on The X Factor . Purple eyeshadow , tiny waist , kitten heels '' . Anna Smith of The Guardian disliked that both Elsa and Anna were drawn with slender figures and large eyes as is typical of Disney princesses . Slate 's Dana Stevens wrote that `` it 's impossible not to thrill to Elsa 's surging sense of power '' but criticized the choice to illustrate her growing confidence by changing her appearance ; Stevens further expressed concern that the switch from the character 's modest coronation gown to `` a slinky , slit - to - the - thigh dress with a transparent snowflake - patterned train and a pair of silver - white high heels '' and a hairstyle that suggested `` come - hither bad - girl seduction '' was overly sexual . Christy Lemire compared Elsa to Carrie White , another well - known fictional female who unleashes magical powers when agitated .
