Adomnan of Iona is one of the earliest Christian proponents of this concept of kings ruling with divine right . He wrote of the Irish King Diarmait mac Cerbaill 's assassination and claimed that divine punishment fell on his assassin for the act of violating the monarch . Adomnan also recorded a story about St Columba supposedly being visited by an angel carrying a glass book and telling him that he needed to ordain Aedan mac Gabrain as King of Dal Riata , but Columba initially refused and to this response , the angel answered by whipping him and demanding that he perform the ordination because God had commanded it . The same angel then visited Columba on three successive nights , and then finally Columba agreed and Aedan came to receive ordination . At the ordination Columba told Aedan that so long as he obeyed God 's laws , then none of his enemies would prevail against him , but the moment he broke them , this protection would end and the same whip with which he had been struck would be turned against the king . Adomnan 's writings most likely influenced other Irish writers , who in turn influenced continental ideas as well . Pepin the Short 's coronation may have also come from the same influence . The Carolingian dynasty and the Holy Roman Emperors also influenced all subsequent western ideas of kingship .
