Mercedes - Benz S - Class Active Body Control system uses another approach : the computer uses sensors to detect lateral load , lateral force , and height difference in the suspension strut , then uses hydraulic pressure to raise or lower the spring to counter roll . This system removes the anti-roll bar . Most active roll control systems allow a small degree of roll to give a more natural feel .
