A number of species of Taraxacum are seed - dispersed ruderals that rapidly colonize disturbed soil , especially the common dandelion ( T. officinale ) , which has been introduced over much of the temperate world . After flowering is finished , the dandelion flower head dries out for a day or two . The dried petals and stamens drop off , the bracts reflex ( curve backwards ) , and the parachute ball opens into a full sphere . When development is complete , the mature seeds are attached to white , fluffy `` parachutes '' which easily detach from the seed head , glide by wind , and disperse .
