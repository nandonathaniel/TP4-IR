The Indo - Iranian migrations took place in two waves . The first wave consisted of the Indo - Aryan migration into the Levant , founding the Mittani kingdom , and a migration south - eastward of the Vedic people , over the Hindu Kush into northern India . The Indo - Aryans split - off around 1800 -- 1600 BCE from the Iranians , where - after they were defeated and split into two groups by the Iranians , who dominated the Central Eurasian steppe zone and `` chased ( the Indo - Aryans ) to the extremities of Central Eurasia '' . One group were the Indo - Aryans who founded the Mitanni kingdom in northern Syria ; ( c. 1500 -- 1300 BCE ) the other group were the Vedic people . Christopher I. Beckwith suggests that the Wusun , an Indo - European Caucasian people of Inner Asia in antiquity , were also of Indo - Aryan origin .
