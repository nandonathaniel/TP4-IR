Criminal justice was entirely separate from civil law and was judged upon common law administered through the Minister of Justice , local governors and the Court minister ( the Nazir ) . Despite being based on urf , it relied upon certain sets of legal principles . Murder was punishable by death , and the penalty for bodily injuries was invariably the bastinado . Robbers had their right wrists amputated the first time , and sentenced to death on any subsequent occasion . State criminals were subjected to the karkan , a triangular wooden collar placed around the neck . On extraordinary occasions when the Shah took justice into his own hand , he would dress himself up in red for the importance of the event , according to ancient tradition .
