The jacket is form - fitting , and has a strap ( croissard ) that passes between the legs . In sabre fencing , jackets are cut along the waist . A small gorget of folded fabric is sewn in around the collar to prevent an opponent 's blade from slipping under the mask and along the jacket upwards towards the neck . Fencing instructors may wear a heavier jacket , such as one reinforced by plastic foam , to deflect the frequent hits an instructor endures .
