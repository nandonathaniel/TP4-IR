A Spanish shepherd , Martin Alhaja , was given the name by the Castilian King Alfonso VIII . In 1212 Alhaja placed a cow skull on the road that led over a pass in the mountains . Using this shepherds path to infiltrate soldiers behind the Moorish position led to the victory of the Spanish king over the Moors at the battle of Navas de Tolosa in Andalusia . He was awarded a coat - of - arms that included cow skulls in its design . A Spanish knight named Fernan Ruiz distinguished himself in a victory over the Moors at Córdoba in 1235 . For his services , the king added Cabeza de Vaca to Ruiz 's name . This name was taken from the area where the knight was born . Research into Alvar Nuñez Cabeza de Vaca 's genealogy indicates that a number of his ancestors and other relatives had the name Fernan Ruiz .
