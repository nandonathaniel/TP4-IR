A change came in the Victorian era with a profusion on the London stage of farces , musical burlesques , extravaganzas and comic operas that competed with productions of Shakespeare 's plays and serious drama by dramatists like James Planché and Thomas William Robertson . In 1855 , the German Reed Entertainments began a process of elevating the level of ( formerly risqué ) musical theatre in Britain that culminated in the famous series of comic operas by Gilbert and Sullivan and was followed by the 1890s with the first Edwardian musical comedies . The length of runs in the theatre changed rapidly during the Victorian period . As transport improved , poverty in London diminished , and street lighting made for safer travel at night , the number of potential patrons for the growing number of theatres increased enormously . Plays could run longer and still draw in the audiences , leading to better profits and improved production values . The first play to achieve 500 consecutive performances was the London comedy Our Boys , opening in 1875 . Its record of 1,362 performances was bested in 1892 by Charley 's Aunt .
