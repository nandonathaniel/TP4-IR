In 2003 , Chris Slusarenko 's Off Records released an album called Wig in a Box , a charity tribute album which also included new material adding to the mythology of Hedwig . Performers included Frank Black and The Breeders . Slusarenko said that he fielded questions from Kim Deal of The Breeders about Black , her former bandmate in The Pixies , with whom she 'd had limited conversation since the band 's breakup in 1993 . They made contact soon after , and Pixies reunited the following spring . Other bands who participated in `` Wig in a Box '' were Yo La Tengo featuring Yoko Ono , Sleater - Kinney featuring Fred Schneider ( of The B - 52 's ) , Jonathan Richman , Rufus Wainwright , Polyphonic Spree , Spoon , Imperial Teen , Bob Mould , Cyndi Lauper with The Minus Five ( featuring Peter Buck of R.E.M. ) , The Bens ( Ben Folds , Ben Lee and Ben Kweller ) , They Might Be Giants and Robyn Hitchcock . Trask and Mitchell completed an unfinished Tommy Gnosis song ( left over from the musical 's development days ) called `` Milford Lake '' ( sung by Mitchell ) and included it . The CD also features comedian Stephen Colbert reciting the spoken introduction to Tear Me Down . The profits of this album benefitted The Hetrick - Martin Institute , home of the Harvey Milk High School , a New York City public school for gay , lesbian , bisexual , transgender and questioning youth who have experienced discrimination and violence in other public schools or at home and are at risk of not completing their secondary education .
