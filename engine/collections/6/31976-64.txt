Overfishing has been cited as a possible reason for a decrease in population of various whitefish , important because of their culinary desirability and , hence , economic consequence . Moreover , between 1879 and 1899 , reported whitefish harvests declined from some 24.3 million pounds ( 11 million kg ) to just over 9 million pounds ( 4 million kg ) . By 1900 , commercial fishermen on Lake Michigan were hauling in an average of 41 million pounds of fish annually . By 1938 , Wisconsin 's commercial fishing operations were motorized and mechanized , generating jobs for more than 2,000 workers , and hauling 14 million pounds per year . The population of giant freshwater mussels was eliminated as the mussels were harvested for use as buttons by early Great Lakes entrepreneurs . Since 2000 , the invasive quagga mussel has smothered the bottom of Lake Michigan almost from shore to shore , and their numbers are estimated at 900 trillion .
