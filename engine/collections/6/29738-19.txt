Cargo sailing ships were slow ; historians estimate that the average speed of all long - distance Mediterranean voyages to Palestine was only 2.8 knots . Passenger ships achieved greater speed by sacrificing cargo space . The sailing ship records were held by the clipper , a very fast sailing ship of the 1843 - 69 era . Clippers were narrow for their length , could carry limited bulk freight , small by later 19th century standards , and had a large total sail area . They average speed was six knots and they carried passengers across the globe , primarily on the trade routes between Britain and its colonies in the east , in trans - Atlantic trade , and the New York - to - San Francisco route round Cape Horn during the California Gold Rush . The much faster steam - powered , iron - hulled ocean liner became the dominant mode of passenger transportation from the 1850s to the 1950s . It used coal -- and needed many coaling stations . After 1900 oil became the favoured fuel and did not require frequent refueling .
