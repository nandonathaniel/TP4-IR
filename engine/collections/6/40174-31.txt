Light tube indicators make electronics cheaper to manufacture since the old way would be to mount a tiny lamp into a small socket directly behind the spot to be illuminated .

Light tubes permit all lights to be mounted on a single flat circuit board , but the illumination can be directed up and away from the board by several inches , wherever it is required .
