The Russian avant - garde was a large , influential wave of modernist art that flourished in Russia from approximately 1890 to 1930 . The term covers many separate , but inextricably related art movements that occurred at the time , namely neo-primitivism , suprematism , constructivism , rayonism , and Russian Futurism . Notable artists from this era include El Lissitzky , Kazimir Malevich , Wassily Kandinsky , and Marc Chagall . Since the 1930s the revolutionary ideas of the avant - garde clashed with the newly emerged conservative direction of socialist realism .
