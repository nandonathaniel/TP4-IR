Safety Screening : - DSC may also be used as an initial safety screening tool . In this mode the sample will be housed in a non-reactive crucible ( often Gold , or Gold plated steel ) , and which will be able to withstand pressure ( typically up to 100 bar ) . The presence of an exothermic event can then be used to assess the stability of a substance to heat . However , due to a combination of relatively poor sensitivity , slower than normal scan rates ( typically 2 -- 3 ° / min - due to much heavier crucible ) and unknown activation energy , it is necessary to deduct about 75 -- 100 ° C from the initial start of the observed exotherm to suggest a maximum temperature for the material . A much more accurate data set can be obtained from an adiabatic calorimeter , but such a test may take 2 -- 3 days from ambient at a rate of 3 ° C increment per half hour .
