Other common objections to the use of EM are that it has a propensity to spuriously identify local maxima , as well as displaying sensitivity to initial values . One may address these problems by evaluating EM at several initial points in the parameter space but this is computationally costly and other approaches , such as the annealing EM method of Udea and Nakano ( 1998 ) ( in which the initial components are essentially forced to overlap , providing a less heterogeneous basis for initial guesses ) , may be preferable .
