Employers ' acceptance of online education has risen over time . More than 50 % of human resource managers SHRM surveyed for an August 2010 report said that if two candidates with the same level of experience were applying for a job , it would not have any kind of effect whether the candidate 's obtained degree was acquired through an online or a traditional school . Seventy - nine percent said they had employed a candidate with an online degree in the past 12 months . However 66 % said candidates who get degrees online were not seen as positively as a job applicant with traditional degrees .
