Many questions regarding prime numbers remain open , such as Goldbach 's conjecture ( that every even integer greater than 2 can be expressed as the sum of two primes ) , and the twin prime conjecture ( that there are infinitely many pairs of primes whose difference is 2 ) . Such questions spurred the development of various branches of number theory , focusing on analytic or algebraic aspects of numbers . Primes are used in several routines in information technology , such as public - key cryptography , which makes use of properties such as the difficulty of factoring large numbers into their prime factors . Prime numbers give rise to various generalizations in other mathematical domains , mainly algebra , such as prime elements and prime ideals .
