The flag has horizontal bands of red ( on the top ) and blue ( on the bottom ) , of equal width , separated by a central green band which splits into a horizontal `` Y '' shape , the arms of which end at the corners of the hoist side ( and follow the flag 's diagonals ) . The `` Y '' embraces a black isosceles triangle from which the arms are separated by narrow yellow bands ; the red and blue bands are separated from the green band and its arms by narrow white stripes . The stripes at the fly end are in the 5 : 1 : 3 : 1 : 5 ratio .
