A poor village in Mexico is periodically raided for food and supplies by a gang of bandits led by Calvera ( Eli Wallach ) . After the latest raid , during which the bandits kill a villager , the village leaders decide they have had enough , and on the advice of the village elder ( Vladimir Sokoloff ) , they decide to fight back . Taking what few objects of value the village has , three villagers ride to a town just inside the United States border hoping to barter for weapons . They are impressed by Chris Adams ( Yul Brynner ) , a veteran Cajun gunslinger , and approach him for advice . Chris suggests they instead hire gunfighters to defend the village , as `` men are cheaper than guns . '' At first agreeing only to help them recruit men , Chris eventually decides to lead the group and , despite the meager pay offered , he finds five willing gunmen .
