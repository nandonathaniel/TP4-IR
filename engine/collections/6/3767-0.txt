Population health has been defined as `` the health outcomes of a group of individuals , including the distribution of such outcomes within the group '' . It is an approach to health that aims to improve the health of an entire human population . This concept does not refer to animal or plant populations . It has been described as consisting of three components . These are `` health outcomes , patterns of health determinants , and policies and interventions '' . A priority considered important in achieving the aim of Population Health is to reduce health inequities or disparities among different population groups due to , among other factors , the social determinants of health , SDOH . The SDOH include all the factors ( social , environmental , cultural and physical ) that the different populations are born into , grow up and function with throughout their lifetimes which potentially have a measurable impact on the health of human populations . The Population Health concept represents a change in the focus from the individual - level , characteristic of most mainstream medicine . It also seeks to complement the classic efforts of public health agencies by addressing a broader range of factors shown to impact the health of different populations . The World Health Organization 's Commission on Social Determinants of Health , reported in 2008 , that the SDOH factors were responsible for the bulk of diseases and injuries and these were the major causes of health inequities in all countries . In the US , SDOH were estimated to account for 70 % of avoidable mortality .
