From the 10th century the Kingdom of Alba was ruled by chiefs ( toisechs ) and subkings ( mormaers ) under the suzerainty , real or nominal , of a High King . Popular assemblies , as in Ireland , were involved in law - making , and sometimes in king - making , although the introduction of tanistry -- naming a successor in the lifetime of a king -- made the second less than common . These early assemblies can not be considered `` parliaments '' in the later sense of the word , and were entirely separate from the later , Norman - influenced , institution .
