European ideas of modern medicine were spread widely through the world by medical missionaries , and the dissemination of textbooks . Japanese elites enthusiastically embraced Western medicine after the Meiji Restoration of the 1860s . However they had been prepared by their knowledge of the Dutch and German medicine , for they had some contact with Europe through the Dutch . Highly influential was the 1765 edition of Hendrik van Deventer 's pioneer work Nieuw Ligt ( `` A New Light '' ) on Japanese obstetrics , especially on Katakura Kakuryo 's publication in 1799 of Sanka Hatsumo ( `` Enlightenment of Obstetrics '' ) . A cadre of Japanese physicians began to interact with Dutch doctors , who introduced smallpox vaccinations . By 1820 Japanese ranp√¥ medical practitioners not only translated Dutch medical texts , they integrated their readings with clinical diagnoses . These men became leaders of the modernization of medicine in their country . They broke from Japanese traditions of closed medical fraternities and adopted the European approach of an open community of collaboration based on expertise in the latest scientific methods .
