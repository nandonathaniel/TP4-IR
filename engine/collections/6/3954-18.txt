Skeletal muscle or `` voluntary muscle '' is anchored by tendons ( or by aponeuroses at a few places ) to bone and is used to effect skeletal movement such as locomotion and in maintaining posture . Though this postural control is generally maintained as an unconscious reflex , the muscles responsible react to conscious control like non-postural muscles . An average adult male is made up of 42 % of skeletal muscle and an average adult female is made up of 36 % ( as a percentage of body mass ) . Smooth muscle or `` involuntary muscle '' is found within the walls of organs and structures such as the esophagus , stomach , intestines , bronchi , uterus , urethra , bladder , blood vessels , and the arrector pili in the skin ( in which it controls erection of body hair ) . Unlike skeletal muscle , smooth muscle is not under conscious control . Cardiac muscle ( myocardium ) , is also an `` involuntary muscle '' but is more akin in structure to skeletal muscle , and is found only in the heart .
