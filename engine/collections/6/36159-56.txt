In 1968 Ohio State defeated the number one - ranked Purdue Boilermakers and continued to an undefeated season including a 50 -- 14 rout of Michigan and a Rose Bowl victory over the USC Trojans that resulted in the national championship . The Class of 1970 became known as the `` super sophomores '' in 1968 , and might have gone on to three consecutive national championships except for what may have been the most bitter loss in Buckeye history . The winning streak reached 22 games as Ohio State traveled to Michigan . The Buckeyes were 17 - point favorites but directed by first - year coach Bo Schembechler , Michigan shocked the Buckeyes in a 24 -- 12 upset .
