The MTA faced a budget deficit of US $1.2 billion in 2009 . This resulted in fare increases ( three times from 2008 to 2010 ) and service reductions ( including the elimination of two part - time subway services , the V and W ) . Several other routes were modified as a result of the deficit . The N was made a full - time local in Manhattan ( in contrast to being a weekend local / weekday express before 2010 ) , while the Q was extended nine stations north to Astoria -- Ditmars Boulevard on weekdays , both to cover the discontinued W . The M was combined with the V , routing it over the Chrystie Street Connection , IND Sixth Avenue Line and IND Queens Boulevard Line to Forest Hills -- 71st Avenue on weekdays instead of via the BMT Fourth Avenue Line and BMT West End Line to Bay Parkway . The G was truncated to Court Square full - time . Construction headways on eleven routes were lengthened , and off - peak service on seven routes were lengthened .
