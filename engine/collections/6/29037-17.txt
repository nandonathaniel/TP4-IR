According to tradition , in 1325 a promissory note was signed in Milan . However , according to a travelogue of a visit to Prague in 960 by Ibrahim ibn Yaqub , small pieces of cloth were used as a means of trade , with these cloths having a set exchange rate versus silver . Around 1150 the Knights Templar issued promissory notes to pilgrims , pilgrims deposited their valuables with a local Templar preceptory before embarking , received a document indicating the value of their deposit , then used that document upon arrival in the Holy Land to retrieve their funds in an amount of treasure of equal value .
