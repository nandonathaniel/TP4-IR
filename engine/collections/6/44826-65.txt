Personality is a frequently cited example of a heritable trait that has been studied in twins and adoptees using behavioral genetic study designs . The most famous categorical organization of heritable personality traits were created by Goldberg ( 1990 ) in which he had college students rate their personalities on 1400 dimensions to begin , and then narrowed these down into `` The Big Five '' factors of personality -- Openness , conscientiousness , extraversion , agreeableness , and neuroticism . The close genetic relationship between positive personality traits and , for example , our happiness traits are the mirror images of comorbidity in psychopathology . These personality factors were consistent across cultures , and many studies have also tested the heritability of these traits .
