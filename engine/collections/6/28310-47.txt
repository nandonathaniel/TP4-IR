The floras of the Appalachians are diverse and vary primarily in response to geology , latitude , elevation and moisture availability . Geobotanically , they constitute a floristic province of the North American Atlantic Region . The Appalachians consist primarily of deciduous broad - leaf trees and evergreen needle - leaf conifers , but also contain the evergreen broad - leaf American holly ( Ilex opaca ) , and the deciduous needle - leaf conifer , the tamarack , or eastern larch ( Larix laricina ) .
