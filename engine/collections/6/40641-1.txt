Originally , operons were thought to exist solely in prokaryotes ( which includes organelles like plastids that are derived from bacteria ) , but since the discovery of the first operons in eukaryotes in the early 1990s , more evidence has arisen to suggest they are more common than previously assumed . In general , expression of prokaryotic operons leads to the generation of polycistronic mRNAs , while eukaryotic operons lead to monocistronic mRNAs .
