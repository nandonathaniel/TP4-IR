The origins of the earlier flag of Great Britain date back to 1606 . James VI of Scotland had inherited the English and Irish thrones in 1603 as James I , thereby uniting the crowns of England , Scotland , and Ireland in a personal union , although the three kingdoms remained separate states . On 12 April 1606 , a new flag to represent this regal union between England and Scotland was specified in a royal decree , according to which the flag of England ( a red cross on a white background , known as St George 's Cross ) , and the flag of Scotland ( a white saltire on a blue background , known as the Saltire or St Andrew 's Cross ) , would be joined together , forming the flag of England and Scotland for maritime purposes . King James also began to refer to a `` Kingdom of Great Britaine '' , although the union remained a personal one .
