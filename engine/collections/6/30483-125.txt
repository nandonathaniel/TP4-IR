Most countries use mean solar time . Australia , Canada ( Quebec only ) , Colombia , France , Germany , New Zealand , Papua New Guinea ( Bougainville only ) , Paraguay , Portugal , Switzerland , the United States and Venezuela use UTC . However , UTC is widely used by the scientific community in countries where mean solar time is official . UTC time is based on the SI second , which was first defined in 1967 , and is based on the use of atomic clocks . Some other less used but closely related time - standards include International Atomic Time ( TAI ) , Terrestrial Time , and Barycentric Dynamical Time .
