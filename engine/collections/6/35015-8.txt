The Zhou dynasty , which overthrew the Shang , was more rooted in an agricultural worldview , and they emphasised a more universal idea of Tian ( å¤© `` Heaven '' ) . The Shang dynasty 's identification of Shangdi as their ancestor - god had asserted their claim to power by divine right ; the Zhou transformed this claim into a legitimacy based on moral power , the Mandate of Heaven . In Zhou theology , Tian had no singular earthly progeny , but bestowed divine favour on virtuous rulers . Zhou kings declared that their victory over the Shang was because they were virtuous and loved their people , while the Shang were tyrants and thus were deprived of power by Tian .
