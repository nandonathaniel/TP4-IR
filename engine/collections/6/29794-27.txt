The summit of Nevado del Ruiz is covered by glaciers ( nevado means `` snow - covered '' in Spanish ) , which formed over many thousands of years , and have generally retreated since the last glacial maximum . From 28,000 to 21,000 years ago , glaciers occupied about 1,500 square kilometers ( 600 sq mi ) of the Ruiz -- Tolima massif . As late as 12,000 years ago , when the ice sheets from the last glacial period were retreating , they still covered 800 square kilometers ( 300 sq mi ) . During the Little Ice Age , which lasted from about 1600 to 1900 CE , the ice cap covered approximately 100 square kilometers ( 40 sq mi ) .
