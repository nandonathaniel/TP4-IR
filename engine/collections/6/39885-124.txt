Motive can not be a defense . If , for example , a person breaks into a laboratory used for the testing of pharmaceuticals on animals , the question of guilt is determined by the presence of an actus reus , i.e. entry without consent and damage to property , and a mens rea , i.e. intention to enter and cause the damage . That the person might have had a clearly articulated political motive to protest such testing does not affect liability . If motive has any relevance , this may be addressed in the sentencing part of the trial , when the court considers what punishment , if any , is appropriate .
