In 1959 , Septima Clarke , Bernice Robinson , and Esau Jenkins , with the help of Myles Horton 's Highlander Folk School in Tennessee , began the first Citizenship Schools in South Carolina 's Sea Islands . They taught literacy to enable blacks to pass voting tests . The program was an enormous success and tripled the number of black voters on Johns Island . SCLC took over the program and duplicated its results elsewhere .
