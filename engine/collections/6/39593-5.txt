In 1769 , Virginia longhunter and explorer Joseph Martin made the first of several forays into the region . Acting as an agent for Dr. Thomas Walker , to whom Martin was connected through family relationships , Martin began an expedition to Powell 's Valley in early 1769 in return for a promised 21,000 - acre ( 8,500 ha ) land grant from Walker and the Loyal Land Company . Martin and his men built the earliest westernmost frontier fort at present - day Rose Hill , Virginia , a fort dubbed Martin 's Station . Later that year Indians chased off Martin and his men , who returned to Albemarle County . Martin returned six years later to rebuild the fort , and a few months later became an agent for Richard Henderson 's Transylvania Company .
