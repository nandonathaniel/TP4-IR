The film was shot primarily in Crema , and in the nearby villages of Pandino and Moscazzano . It was shot during an unexpected historic rainstorm in Italy , described by the weather reports as a `` once - in - century rain . '' The pre-production in Crema was fast : a search for extras began there in March and April . Scenes from Pandino and Moscazzano were filmed from May 17 , before moving to Crema on June 1 . Additional outdoor scenes were shot at the Palazzo Albergoni on December 4 , 2016 . Several historical locations in the surrounding streets in Crema and Pandino were chosen during production , including the Crema Cathedral . Businesses received compensation for financial losses caused by the closure , scheduled for May 30 and 31 . Two days ' filming at the cathedral were postponed due to the weather .
