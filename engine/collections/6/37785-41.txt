One of the great scoops in Tribune history came when it obtained the text of the Treaty of Versailles in June 1919 . Another was its revelation of United States war plans on the eve of the Pearl Harbor attack . The Tribune 's June 7 , 1942 , front page announcement that the United States had broken Japan 's naval code was the revelation by the paper of a closely guarded military secret . The story revealing that Americans broke the enemy naval codes was not cleared by censors , and had US President Franklin D. Roosevelt so enraged that he considered shutting down the Tribune .
