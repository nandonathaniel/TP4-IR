The Shias openly revolted against Saddam following the Gulf War in 1991 and were encouraged by Saddam 's defeat in Kuwait and by simultaneous Kurdish uprising in the north . However , Shia opposition to the government was brutally suppressed , resulting in some 50,000 to 100,000 casualties and successive repression by Saddam 's forces . The governing regimes of Iraq were composed mainly of Sunnis for nearly a century until the 2003 Iraq War .
