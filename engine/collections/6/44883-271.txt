Islam is the second largest religion in the state . In 2012 , there were about 825,000 Muslims in the Netherlands ( 5 % of the population ) . Muslim numbers increased from the 1960 as a consequence of large numbers of migrant workers . This included migrants from former Dutch colonies , such as Surinam and Indonesia , but mainly migrant workers from Turkey and Morocco . During the 1990s , Muslim refugees arrived from countries like Bosnia and Herzegovina , Iran , Iraq , Somalia , and Afghanistan .
