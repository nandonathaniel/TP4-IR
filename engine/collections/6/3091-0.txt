`` The Princes in the Tower '' is an expression frequently used to refer to Edward V , King of England and Richard of Shrewsbury , Duke of York . The two brothers were the only sons of Edward IV of England and Elizabeth Woodville surviving at the time of their father 's death in 1483 . When they were 12 and 9 years old , respectively , they were lodged in the Tower of London by the man appointed to look after them , their uncle , the Lord Protector : Richard , Duke of Gloucester . This was supposedly in preparation for Edward 's forthcoming coronation as king . However , Richard took the throne for himself and the boys disappeared .
