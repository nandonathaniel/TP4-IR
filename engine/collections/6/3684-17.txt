Completed in 1998 , it is a steel sculpture of an angel , 20 metres ( 66 ft ) tall , with wings measuring 54 metres ( 177 ft ) across . The wings do not stand straight sideways , but are angled 3.5 degrees forward ; Gormley did this to create `` a sense of embrace '' . The angel like much of Gormley 's other work is based on a cast of his body .
