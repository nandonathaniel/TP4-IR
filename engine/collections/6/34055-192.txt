Shamanic practices may originate as early as the Paleolithic , predating all organized religions , and certainly as early as the Neolithic period . The earliest known undisputed burial of a shaman ( and by extension the earliest undisputed evidence of shamans and shamanic practices ) dates back to the early Upper Paleolithic era ( c . 30,000 BP ) in what is now the Czech Republic .
