The proposal of using criminal sanctions to enforce attendance under this new system was opposed by MPs from both the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats , who believed compulsion and threats were the wrong approach to increasing participation . A spokesperson for the DfES said the proposals were not about `` forcing young people to do something they do n't want to '' , and that `` we are letting young people down if we allow them to leave education and training without skills at the age of 16 . '' However , the Prime Minister 's Queen 's Speech in November 2007 , which discussed the raise in school leaving age , suggested that pupils who failed to comply with new laws are to be expected to face fines or community service , rather than custodial sentencing which had previously been proposed . Local Authorities will also be expected to ensure pupils are participating up to 18 years of age .
