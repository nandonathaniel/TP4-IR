The Revolution caused a massive shift of power from the Roman Catholic Church to the state . Under the Ancien RÃ©gime , the Church had been the largest single landowner in the country , owning about 10 % of the land in the kingdom . The Church was exempt from paying taxes to the government , while it levied a tithe -- a 10 % tax on income , often collected in the form of crops -- on the general population , only a fraction of which it then redistributed to the poor .
