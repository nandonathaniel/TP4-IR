A lightly regarded prospect coming out of college , Brady was selected by the New England Patriots with the 199th overall pick in the sixth round of 2000 NFL Draft and has since spent his entire 18 - season career with the Patriots . Since Brady became their starting quarterback in 2001 , the Patriots have never had a losing season and have won 14 division titles . The Patriots played in eleven AFC Championship Games from 2001 to 2016 -- including six in a row from 2011 to 2016 -- and won seven of them . Brady and Patriots head coach Bill Belichick have combined to form the most successful quarterback - head coach tandem in NFL history , winning more regular season games and postseason games than any other such duo as well as appearing in seven Super Bowls . All of these events set new NFL records .
