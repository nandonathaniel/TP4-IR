Since the North Sea is relatively warm ( around 13 째 C or 55.4 째 F at the beginning of winter , typically 10 to 6 째 C or 50 to 43 째 F by the end ) , sufficiently cold air aloft can create significant snowfalls in a relatively short period of time . The best - known example occurred in January 1987 , when record - breaking cold air ( associated with an upper low ) moved across the North Sea towards the UK . The end result was over two foot of snow for coastal areas , leading to communities being cut off for over a week . The latest of these events to affect Britain 's east coast occurred on November 30th 2017 , February 28th 2018 and 17th March 2018 in connection with the 2018 Great Britain and Ireland cold wave . The 2nd event of Winter 2017 / 18 was particularly severe , with up to 27.5 inches ( 70 cm ) falling in total over the 27th - 28th .
