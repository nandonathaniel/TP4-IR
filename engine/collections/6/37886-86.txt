The flowering plants have long been assumed to have evolved from within the gymnosperms ; according to the traditional morphological view , they are closely allied to the Gnetales . However , as noted above , recent molecular evidence is at odds with this hypothesis , and further suggests that Gnetales are more closely related to some gymnosperm groups than angiosperms , and that extant gymnosperms form a distinct clade to the angiosperms , the two clades diverging some 300 million years ago .
