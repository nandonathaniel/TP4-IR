About the year 1337 Hesychasm attracted the attention of a learned member of the Orthodox Church , Barlaam of Calabria who at that time held the office of abbot in the Monastery of St Saviour 's in Constantinople and who visited Mount Athos . Mount Athos was then at the height of its fame and influence under the reign of Andronicus III Palaeologus and under the ' first - ship ' of the Protos Symeon . On Mount Athos , Barlaam encountered Hesychasts and heard descriptions of their practices , also reading the writings of the teacher in Hesychasm of St Gregory Palamas , himself an Athonite monk . Trained in Western Scholastic theology , Barlaam was scandalised by Hesychasm and began to combat it both orally and in his writings . As a private teacher of theology in the Western Scholastic mode , Barlaam propounded a more intellectual and propositional approach to the knowledge of God than the Hesychasts taught . Hesychasm is a form of constant purposeful prayer or experiential prayer , explicitly referred to as contemplation . Descriptions of the Hesychast practices can be found in the Philokalia , The Way of a Pilgrim , and St. John Climacus ' The Ladder of Divine Ascent .
