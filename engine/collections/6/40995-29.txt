A diet deficient in vitamin D in conjunction with inadequate sun exposure causes osteomalacia ( or rickets when it occurs in children ) , which is a softening of the bones . In the developed world , this is a rare disease . However , vitamin D deficiency has become a worldwide problem in the elderly and remains common in children and adults . Low blood calcifediol ( 25 - hydroxy - vitamin D ) can result from avoiding the sun . Deficiency results in impaired bone mineralization and bone damage which leads to bone - softening diseases , including rickets and osteomalacia .
