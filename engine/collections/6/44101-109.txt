On Earth , a characteristic temperature for T s ( \ displaystyle T_ ( s ) ) is 300 K and for T o ( \ displaystyle T_ ( o ) ) is 200 K , corresponding to a Carnot efficiency of Îµ = 1 / 3 ( \ displaystyle \ epsilon = 1 / 3 ) . The ratio of the surface exchange coefficients , C k / C d ( \ displaystyle C_ ( k ) / C_ ( d ) ) , is typically taken to be 1 . However , observations suggest that the drag coefficient C d ( \ displaystyle C_ ( d ) ) varies with wind speed and may decrease at high wind speeds within the boundary layer of a mature hurricane . Additionally , C k ( \ displaystyle C_ ( k ) ) may vary at high wind speeds due to the effect of sea spray on evaporation within the boundary layer .
