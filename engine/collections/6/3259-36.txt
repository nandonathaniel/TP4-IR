Flair signed with the World Wrestling Federation ( WWF ) in September 1991 and began appearing on television with the Big Gold Belt , calling himself `` The Real World Champion '' . Led by his `` financial adviser '' Bobby Heenan and his `` executive consultant '' Mr. Perfect , Flair repeatedly issued challenges to WWF wrestlers like `` Rowdy '' Roddy Piper and Hulk Hogan , wrestling a team led by Piper at Survivor Series in November 1991 and helping The Undertaker defeat Hogan for the WWF Championship that same night . WCW sued Flair in an attempt to reclaim the championship belt , but Flair claimed that he owned the title belt in lieu of the US $25,000 deposit paid by NWA champions upon winning the title , which had not been returned to him when he was fired from WCW .
