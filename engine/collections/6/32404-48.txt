This is the reason for the frequent choice of the law of the State of New York in commercial contracts , even when neither entity has extensive contacts with New York -- and remarkably often even when neither party has contacts with the United States . Commercial contracts almost always include a `` choice of law clause '' to reduce uncertainty . Somewhat surprisingly , contracts throughout the world ( for example , contracts involving parties in Japan , France and Germany , and from most of the other states of the United States ) often choose the law of New York , even where the relationship of the parties and transaction to New York is quite attenuated . Because of its history as the United States ' commercial center , New York common law has a depth and predictability not ( yet ) available in any other jurisdictions of the United States . Similarly , American corporations are often formed under Delaware corporate law , and American contracts relating to corporate law issues ( merger and acquisitions of companies , rights of shareholders , and so on . ) include a Delaware choice of law clause , because of the deep body of law in Delaware on these issues . Outside the United States , parties that are in different jurisdictions from each other often choose the law of England and Wales , particularly when the parties are each in former British colonies and members of the Commonwealth . The common theme in all cases is that commercial parties seek predictability and simplicity in their contractual relations , and frequently choose the law of a common law jurisdiction with a well - developed body of common law to achieve that result .
