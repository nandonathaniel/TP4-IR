In a 2001 interview , Rowling said Voldemort was invented as a nemesis for Harry Potter ( the protagonist of the novels ) , and she intentionally did not flesh out Voldemort 's backstory at first . `` The basic idea ( was that Harry ) did n't know he was a wizard ... And so then I kind of worked backwards from that position to find out how that could be , that he would n't know what he was ... When he was one year old , the most evil wizard for hundreds and hundreds of years attempted to kill him . He killed Harry 's parents , and then he tried to kill Harry -- he tried to curse him ... Harry has to find out , before we find out . And -- so -- but for some mysterious reason the curse did n't work on Harry . So he 's left with this lightning bolt shaped scar on his forehead and the curse rebounded upon the evil wizard , who has been in hiding ever since . ''
