There is evidence from mitochondrial DNA that modern humans have passed through at least one genetic bottleneck , in which genome diversity was drastically reduced . Henry Harpending has proposed that humans spread from a geographically restricted area about 100,000 years ago , the passage through the geographic bottleneck and then with a dramatic growth amongst geographically dispersed populations about 50,000 years ago , beginning first in Africa and thence spreading elsewhere . Climatological and geological evidence suggests evidence for the bottleneck . The explosion of Lake Toba created a 1,000 year cold period , as a result of the largest volcanic eruption of the Quaternary , potentially reducing human populations to a few tropical refugia . It has been estimated that as few as 15,000 humans survived . In such circumstances genetic drift and founder effects may have been maximised . The greater diversity amongst African genomes may be in part due to the greater prevalence of African refugia during the Toba incident . However , a recent review highlights that the single - source hypothesis of non-African populations is less supported by ancient DNA analysis than multiple sources plus genetic mixing across Eurasia .
