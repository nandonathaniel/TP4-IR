Before the rise of professional historians in the 19th century , the Spanish Inquisition had largely been portrayed by Protestant scholars who saw it as the archetypal symbol of Catholic intolerance and ecclesiastical power . The Spanish Inquisition for them was largely associated with the persecution of Protestants , or inexplicably , of witches . William H. Prescott described the Inquisition as an `` eye that never slumbered '' . Despite of the existence of extensive documentation regarding the trials and procedures , and to the Inquisition 's deep bureaucratization , none of these sources were studied outside of Spain , and Spanish scholars arguing against the predominant view were automatically dismissed . The 19th - century professional historians , including the Spanish scholar Amador de los Rios , were the first to successfully challenge this perception in the international sphere and get foreign scholars to make eco of their discoveries . Said scholars would obtain international recognition and start a period of revision on the Black Legend of the Spanish Inquisition .
