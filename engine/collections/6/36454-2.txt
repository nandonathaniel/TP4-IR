With alcohol consumption , a drunk driver 's level of intoxication is typically determined by a measurement of blood alcohol content or BAC ; but this can also be expressed as a breath test measurement , often referred to as a BrAC . A BAC or BrAC measurement in excess of the specific threshold level , such as 0.08 % , defines the criminal offense with no need to prove impairment . In some jurisdictions , there is an aggravated category of the offense at a higher BAC level , such as 0.12 % , 0.15 % or 0.25 % . In many jurisdictions , police officers can conduct field tests of suspects to look for signs of intoxication . The US state of Colorado has a maximum blood content of THC for drivers who have consumed cannabis .
