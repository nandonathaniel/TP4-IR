Using public transportation can result in a reduction of an individual 's carbon footprint . A single person , 20 - mile ( 32 km ) round trip by car can be replaced using public transportation and result in a net CO emissions reduction of 4,800 pounds ( 2,200 kg ) per year . Using public transportation saves CO emissions in more ways than simply travel as public transportation can help to alleviate traffic congestion as well as promote more efficient land use . When all three of these are considered , it is estimated that 37 million metric tons of CO will be saved annually . Another study claims that using public transit instead of private in the U.S. in 2005 would have reduced CO emissions by 3.9 million metric tons and that the resulting traffic congestion reduction accounts for an additional 3.0 million metric tons of CO saved . This is a total savings of about 6.9 million metric tons per year given the 2005 values .
