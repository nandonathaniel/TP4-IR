`` After You 've Gone '' is a 1918 popular song composed by Turner Layton with lyrics by Henry Creamer . It was recorded by Marion Harris on July 22 , 1918 , and released by Victor Records . The chorus adheres to a standard ABAC pattern , but is only 20 measures long . There are four 4 - bar phrases , followed by a 4 measure tag . The song is harmonically active , with chord changes almost every measure . The opening four notes are identical to the opening notes of Peg o ' My Heart ( 1912 ) -- at the time songwriters often borrowed the first few notes of a hit melody .
