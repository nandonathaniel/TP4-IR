To make best use of the waters of the Nile river , the Egyptians developed systems of irrigation . Irrigation allowed the Egyptians to use the Nile 's waters for a variety of purposes . Notably , irrigation granted them greater control over their agricultural practices . Flood waters were diverted away from certain areas , such as cities and gardens , to keep them from flooding . Irrigation was also used to provide drinking water to Egyptians . Despite the fact that irrigation was crucial to their agricultural success , there were no statewide regulations on water control . Rather , irrigation was the responsibility of local farmers . However , the earliest and most famous reference to irrigation in Egyptian archaeology has been found on the mace head of the Scorpion King , which has been roughly dated to about 3100 BC . The mace head depicts the king cutting into a ditch that is part of a grid of basin irrigation . The association of the high ranking king with irrigation highlights the importance of irrigation and agriculture to their society .
