In Egypt the principal writing material was of quite a different sort . Wooden tablets are found pictured on the monuments ; but the material which was in common use , even from very ancient times , was the papyrus . This reed , found chiefly in Lower Egypt , had various economic means for writing , the pith was taken out , and divided by a pointed instrument into the thin pieces of which it is composed ; it was then flattened by pressure , and the strips glued together , other strips being placed at right angles to them , so that a roll of any length might be manufactured . Writing seems to have become more widespread with the invention of papyrus in Egypt . That this material was in use in Egypt from a very early period is evidenced by still existing papyrus of the earliest Theban dynasties . As the papyrus , being in great demand , and exported to all parts of the world , became very costly , other materials were often used instead of it , among which is mentioned leather , a few leather mills of an early period having been found in the tombs . Parchment , using sheepskins left after the wool was removed for cloth , was sometimes cheaper than papyrus , which had to be imported outside Egypt . With the invention of wood - pulp paper , the cost of writing material began a steady decline .
