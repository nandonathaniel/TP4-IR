From September 1947 , Toyota 's small - sized vehicles were sold under the name `` Toyopet '' ( トヨペット ) . The first vehicle sold under this name was the Toyopet SA , but it also included vehicles such as the Toyopet SB light truck , Toyopet Stout light truck , Toyopet Crown , Toyopet Master , and the Toyopet Corona . The word `` Toyopet ( Japanese article ) '' was a nickname given to the Toyota SA due to its small size , as the result of a naming contest the Toyota Company organized in 1947 . However , when Toyota eventually entered the American market in 1957 with the Crown , the name was not well received due to connotations of toys and pets . The name was soon dropped for the American market , but continued in other markets until the mid-1960s .
