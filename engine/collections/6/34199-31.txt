The song received generally favorable reviews from music critics . Writing for Billboard , Chuck Taylor commented that `` there 's no reason that ' Man ! ' , with its coquettish turn of phrase , should n't have the same kind of appeal as her earlier ' That Do n't Impress Me Much ' , '' also noting that the song has `` plenty of tasty ingredients that radio traditionally searches out - great tempo , attitude , a hook that sells like ice cream in summer , and the instantly recognizable vocals of a woman who is a found acquaintance of so many millions out there now . '' Taylor ultimately called it `` country crossover at its best . '' Chuck Eddy of Rolling Stone noted that `` Man ! I Feel Like a Woman ! '' and other high - gloss songs `` open with a bubblegum - glam cheerleader shout , then blasts into radio - ready rapture with offhand vocal interjections -- doot - doot - doot scatting , do - si - do rapping , sexy squeaks , sarcastic Alanis Morissette asides .
