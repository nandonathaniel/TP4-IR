The Neolithic Revolution involved far more than the adoption of a limited set of food - producing techniques . During the next millennia it would transform the small and mobile groups of hunter - gatherers that had hitherto dominated human pre-history into sedentary ( non-nomadic ) societies based in built - up villages and towns . These societies radically modified their natural environment by means of specialized food - crop cultivation , with activities such as irrigation and deforestation which allowed the production of surplus food . Other developments found very widely are the domestication of animals , pottery , polished stone tools , and rectangular houses .
