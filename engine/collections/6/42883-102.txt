In her review of the personality disorder literature published in 2007 , Lee Anna Clark asserted that `` the five - factor model of personality is widely accepted as representing the higher - order structure of both normal and abnormal personality traits '' . However , other researches disagree that this model is widely accepted ( see the section Critique below ) and suggest that it simply replicates early temperament research . Noticeably , FFM publications never compare their findings to temperament models even though temperament and mental disorders ( especially personality disorders ) are thought to be based on the same neurotransmitter imbalances , just to varying degrees .
