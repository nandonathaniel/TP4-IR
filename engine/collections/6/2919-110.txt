Biologist E.O. Wilson estimated in 2002 that if current rates of human destruction of the biosphere continue , one - half of all plant and animal species of life on earth will be extinct in 100 years . More significantly , the current rate of global species extinctions is estimated as 100 to 1000 times `` background '' rates ( the average extinction rates in the evolutionary time scale of planet Earth ) , while future rates are likely 10,000 times higher . However , some groups are going extinct much faster . Biologists Paul R. Ehrlich and Stuart Pimm , among others , contend that human population growth and overconsumption are the main drivers of the modern extinction crisis .
