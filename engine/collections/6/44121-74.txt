The South sent delegations to Washington and offered to pay for the federal properties and enter into a peace treaty with the United States . Lincoln rejected any negotiations with Confederate agents because he claimed the Confederacy was not a legitimate government , and that making any treaty with it would be tantamount to recognition of it as a sovereign government . Secretary of State William Seward , who at the time saw himself as the real governor or `` prime minister '' behind the throne of the inexperienced Lincoln , engaged in unauthorized and indirect negotiations that failed . President Lincoln was determined to hold all remaining Union - occupied forts in the Confederacy , Fort Monroe in Virginia , in Florida , Fort Pickens , Fort Jefferson , and Fort Taylor , and in the cockpit of secession , Charleston , South Carolina 's Fort Sumter .
