With a diagnosis of pusher behaviour , three important variables should be seen , the most obvious of which is spontaneous body posture of a longitudinal tilt of the torso toward the paretic side of the body occurring on a regular basis and not only on occasion . The use of the nonparetic extremities to create the pathological lateral tilt of the body axis is another sign to be noted when diagnosing for pusher behaviour . This includes abduction and extension of the extremities of the non-affected side , to help in the push toward the affected ( paretic ) side . The third variable that is seen is that attempts of the therapist to correct the pusher posture by aiming to realign them to upright posture are resisted by the patient .
