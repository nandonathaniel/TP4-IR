The state police issue licenses for the concealed carry of handguns to qualified applicants age 21 or older who pass a 16 - hour training course . However , any law enforcement agency can object to an individual being granted a license `` based upon a reasonable suspicion that the applicant is a danger to himself or herself or others , or a threat to public safety '' . Objections are considered by a Concealed Carry Licensing Review Board , which decides whether or not the license will be issued , based on `` a preponderance of the evidence '' . Licenses issued by other states are not recognized , except for carry in a vehicle . Open carry is prohibited in most areas . When a firearm is being transported by a person without a concealed carry license , it must be unloaded and enclosed in a case , or broken down in a non-functioning state , or not immediately accessible .
