In 1963 , Carl F. Essig of the Addiction Research Center of the National Institute of Mental Health stated that meprobamate , glutethimide , ethinamate , ethchlorvynol , methyprylon and chlordiazepoxide as drugs whose usefulness can hardly be questioned . However , Essig labeled these newer products as drugs of addiction , like barbiturates , whose habit - forming qualities were more widely known . He mentioned a 90 - day study of chlordiazepoxide , which concluded that the automobile accident rate among 68 users was 10 times higher than normal . Participants ' daily dosage ranged from 5 to 100 milligrams .
