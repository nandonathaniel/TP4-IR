In the most recent election of 2010 , there were numerous examples of gerrymandering throughout the entire country of Sudan . A report from the Rift Valley Institute uncovered violations of Sudan 's electoral law , where constituencies were created that were well below and above the required limit . According to Sudan 's National Elections Act of 2008 , no constituency can have a population that is 15 % greater or less than the average constituency size . The Rift Valley Report uncovered a number of constituencies that are in violation of this rule . Examples include constituencies in Jonglei , Warrap , South Darfur , and several other states .
