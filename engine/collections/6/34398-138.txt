The Constitutional Acts of 11 and 12 July 1940 granted to Pétain all powers ( legislative , judicial , administrative , executive -- and diplomatic ) and the title of `` head of the French state '' ( chef de l'État français ) , as well as the right to nominate his successor . On 12 July Pétain designated Laval as Vice-President and his designated successor , and appointed Fernand de Brinon as representative to the German High Command in Paris . Pétain remained the head of the Vichy regime until 20 August 1944 . The French national motto , Liberté , Egalité , Fraternité ( Freedom , Equality , Brotherhood ) , was replaced by Travail , Famille , Patrie ( Work , Family , Fatherland ) ; it was noted at the time that TFP also stood for the criminal punishment of `` travaux forcés à perpetuité '' ( `` forced labor in perpetuity '' ) . Reynaud was arrested in September 1940 by the Vichy government and sentenced to life imprisonment in 1941 before the opening of the Riom Trial .
