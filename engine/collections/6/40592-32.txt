Most liquids under increased pressure freeze at higher temperatures because the pressure helps to hold the molecules together . However , the strong hydrogen bonds in water make it different : For some pressures higher than 1 atm ( 0.10 MPa ) , water freezes at a temperature below 0 Â° C , as shown in the phase diagram below . The melting of ice under high pressures is thought to contribute to the movement of glaciers .
