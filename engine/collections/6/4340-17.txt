In 2005 , the International Committee for Weights and Measures ( CIPM ) approved preparation of new definitions for the kilogram , the ampere , and the kelvin and it noted the possibility of a new definition of the mole based on the Avogadro constant . The 23rd CGPM ( 2007 ) decided to postpone any formal change until the next General Conference in 2011 .
