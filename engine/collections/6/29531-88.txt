For landings and take - offs , wire flying riggings were devised and used . On location , these were suspended from tower cranes , whereas in the studio elaborate rigs were suspended from the studio ceilings . Some of the wire - flying work was quite audacious considering computer - controlled rigs were not then available -- the penultimate shot where Superman flies out of the prison yard for example . Although stuntmen were used , Reeve did much of the work himself , and was suspended as high as 50 feet in the air . Counterweights and pulleys were typically used to achieve flying movement , rather than electronic or motorized devices . The thin wires used to suspend Reeve were typically removed from the film in post-production using rotoscope techniques , although this was n't necessary in all shots ( in certain lighting conditions or when Superman is very distant in the frame , the wires were more or less imperceptible ) .
