Viral infections of the heart can lead to inflammation of the muscular layer of the heart and subsequently contribute to the development of heart failure . Heart damage can predispose a person to develop heart failure later in life and has many causes including systemic viral infections ( e.g. , HIV ) , chemotherapeutic agents such as daunorubicin , cyclophosphamide , and trastuzumab , and abuse of drugs such as alcohol , cocaine , and methamphetamine . An uncommon cause is exposure to certain toxins such as lead and cobalt . Additionally , infiltrative disorders such as amyloidosis and connective tissue diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus have similar consequences . Obstructive sleep apnea ( a condition of sleep wherein disordered breathing overlaps with obesity , hypertension , and / or diabetes ) is regarded as an independent cause of heart failure .
