Among the metallic elements that occur in nature in significant quantities ( 56 up to U , without Tc and Pm ) , almost half ( 27 ) are allotropic at ambient pressure : Li , Be , Na , Ca , Ti , Mn , Fe , Co , Sr , Y , Zr , Sn , La , Ce , Pr , Nd , Sm , Gd , Tb , Dy , Yb , Hf , Tl , Th , Pa and U . Some phase transitions between allotropic forms of technologically relevant metals are those of Ti at 882 ° C , Fe at 912 ° C and 1394 ° C , Co at 422 ° C , Zr at 863 ° C , Sn at 13 ° C and U at 668 ° C and 776 ° C .
