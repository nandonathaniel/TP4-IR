Most portable computers have power supplies that provide 25 to 200 W. In portable computers ( such as laptops ) there is usually an external power supply ( sometimes referred to as a `` power brick '' due to its similarity , in size , shape and weight , to a real brick ) which converts AC power to one DC voltage ( most commonly 19 V ) , and further DC - DC conversion occurs within the laptop to supply the various DC voltages required by the other components of the portable computer .
