Conflict between these ghilman and the population of Baghdad prompted the caliph al - Mu'tasim to move his capital to the city of Samarra , but this did not succeed in calming tensions . The caliph al - Mutawakkil was assassinated by some of these slave - soldiers in 861 ( see Anarchy at Samarra ) .
