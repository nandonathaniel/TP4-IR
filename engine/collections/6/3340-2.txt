The three wise monkeys ( Japanese : 三猿 , Hepburn : san'en or sanzaru , alternatively 三 匹 の 猿 sanbiki no saru , literally `` three monkeys '' ) , sometimes called the three mystic apes , are a pictorial maxim . Together they embody the proverbial principle `` see no evil , hear no evil , speak no evil '' . The three monkeys are Mizaru , covering his eyes , who sees no evil ; Kikazaru , covering his ears , who hears no evil ; and Iwazaru , covering his mouth , who speaks no evil .
