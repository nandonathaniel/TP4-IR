The in situ underwater archaeological investigation and excavation culminated with the raising of the Hunley on August 8 , 2000 . A large team of professionals from the Naval Historical Center 's Underwater Archaeology Branch , National Park Service , the South Carolina Institute of Archaeology and Anthropology , and various other individuals investigated the vessel , measuring and documenting her prior to removal . Once the on - site investigation was complete , harnesses were slipped underneath the sub and attached to a truss designed by Oceaneering International . After the last harness had been secured , the crane from the recovery barge Karlissa B hoisted the submarine from the sea floor . She was raised from the open waters of the Atlantic Ocean , just over 3.5 nautical miles ( 6.5 km ) from Sullivan 's Island outside the entrance to Charleston Harbor . Despite having used a sextant and hand - held compass , thirty years earlier , to plot the wreck 's location , Dr. Spence 's 52 meters accuracy turned out to be well within the length of the recovery barge , which was 64 meters long . On August 8 , 2000 , at 8 : 37 a.m. , the sub broke the surface for the first time in more than 136 years , greeted by a cheering crowd on shore and in surrounding watercraft , including author Clive Cussler . Once safely on her transporting barge , the Hunley was shipped back to Charleston . The removal operation concluded when the submarine was secured inside the Warren Lasch Conservation Center , at the former Charleston Navy Yard in North Charleston , in a specially designed tank of fresh water to await conservation until she could eventually be exposed to air .
