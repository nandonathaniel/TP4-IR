Computing the reciprocal is important in many division algorithms , since the quotient a / b can be computed by first computing 1 / b and then multiplying it by a . Noting that f ( x ) = 1 / x âˆ’ b ( \ displaystyle f ( x ) = 1 / x-b ) has a zero at x = 1 / b , Newton 's method can find that zero , starting with a guess x 0 ( \ displaystyle x_ ( 0 ) ) and iterating using the rule :
