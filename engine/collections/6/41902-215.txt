Sumerian agriculture depended heavily on irrigation . The irrigation was accomplished by the use of shaduf , canals , channels , dykes , weirs , and reservoirs . The frequent violent floods of the Tigris , and less so , of the Euphrates , meant that canals required frequent repair and continual removal of silt , and survey markers and boundary stones needed to be continually replaced . The government required individuals to work on the canals in a corvee , although the rich were able to exempt themselves .
