The anode is the electrode where oxidation ( loss of electrons ) takes place ; in a galvanic cell , it is the negative electrode , as when oxidation occurs , electrons are left behind on the electrode . These electrons then migrate to the cathode ( positive electrode ) . However , in electrolysis , an electric current stimulates electron flow in the opposite direction . Thus , the anode is positive , and the statement anode attracts anions is true ( negatively charged ions flow to the anode , while electrons are expelled through the wire ) . The metal - A electrode is the anode .
