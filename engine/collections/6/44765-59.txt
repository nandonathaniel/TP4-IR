Angiogenesis is generally associated with aerobic exercise and endurance exercise . While arteriogenesis produces network changes that allow for a large increase in the amount of total flow in a network , angiogenesis causes changes that allow for greater nutrient delivery over a long period of time . Capillaries are designed to provide maximum nutrient delivery efficiency , so an increase in the number of capillaries allows the network to deliver more nutrients in the same amount of time . A greater number of capillaries also allows for greater oxygen exchange in the network . This is vitally important to endurance training , because it allows a person to continue training for an extended period of time . However , no experimental evidence suggests that increased capillarity is required in endurance exercise to increase the maximum oxygen delivery .
