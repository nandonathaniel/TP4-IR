The major homeostatic control point for maintaining this stable balance is renal excretion . The kidney is directed to excrete or retain sodium via the action of aldosterone , antidiuretic hormone ( ADH , or vasopressin ) , atrial natriuretic peptide ( ANP ) , and other hormones . Abnormal ranges of the fractional excretion of sodium can imply acute tubular necrosis or glomerular dysfunction .
