The spill was also notable for the volume of Corexit oil dispersant used and for application methods that were `` purely experimental . '' Altogether , 1.84 million US gallons ( 7,000 m ) of dispersants were used ; of this 771,000 US gallons ( 2,920 m ) were released at the wellhead . Subsea injection had never previously been tried but due to the spill 's unprecedented nature BP together with USCG and EPA decided to use it . Over 400 sorties were flown to release the product . Although usage of dispersants was described as `` the most effective and fast moving tool for minimizing shoreline impact '' , the approach continues to be investigated .
