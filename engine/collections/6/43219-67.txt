In relation to mathematics , the second national language and foreign languages , a student can choose to study a curriculum from different levels of difficulty . Students choose their relevant levels at the beginning of school , when selecting appropriate courses , and at the end of school , when registering for the matriculation exam in order to receive the relevant exam paper . These two choices are not directly linked , but students generally keep the level the same for the matriculation exam . One common exception to this rule of thumb occurs when a student has barely completed a higher level course and is unsure of their performance in the matriculation exam . In those cases , a student may elect to take an easier exam .
