The restaurant 's signature is serving USDA prime steaks that are seared at 1800 째 Fahrenheit ( approximately 980 째 C ) and served on ceramic plates heated to 500 째 Fahrenheit ( 260 째 C ) . Half an ounce ( 1 Tbsp ) of butter is added just before the plates leave the kitchen in order to create the signature ' sizzle ' . Fertel firmly believed that the success of her steaks was due as much to the sound and smell of the ' sizzle ' as well as the taste . `` You hear that sizzle , and you think , ' I wonder if that 's my steak ' '' , she commented in an interview shortly before her death .
