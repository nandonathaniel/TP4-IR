When Alaska and Hawaii were being considered for statehood in the 1950s , more than 1,500 designs were submitted to President Dwight D. Eisenhower . Although some of them were 49 - star versions , the vast majority were 50 - star proposals . At least three of these designs were identical to the present design of the 50 - star flag . At the time , credit was given by the executive department to the United States Army Institute of Heraldry for the design .
