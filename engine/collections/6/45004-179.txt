Since the invasion , the U.S. government statements concerning Iraqi weapons programs and links to al - Qaeda have been discredited . While the debate of whether Iraq intended to develop chemical , biological , and nuclear weapons in the future remains open , no WMDs have been found in Iraq since the invasion despite comprehensive inspections lasting more than 18 months . In Cairo , on 24 February 2001 , Colin Powell had predicted as much , saying , `` ( Saddam ) has not developed any significant capability with respect to weapons of mass destruction . He is unable to project conventional power against his neighbours . '' Similarly , assertions of operational links between the Iraqi regime and al - Qaeda have largely been discredited by the intelligence community , and Secretary Powell himself later admitted he had no proof .
