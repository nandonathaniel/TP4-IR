The middle years of Edward 's reign were a period of significant legislative activity . Perhaps the best - known piece of legislation was the Statute of Labourers of 1351 , which addressed the labour shortage problem caused by the Black Death . The statute fixed wages at their pre-plague level and checked peasant mobility by asserting that lords had first claim on their men 's services . In spite of concerted efforts to uphold the statute , it eventually failed due to competition among landowners for labour . The law has been described as an attempt `` to legislate against the law of supply and demand '' , which made it doomed to fail . Nevertheless , the labour shortage had created a community of interest between the smaller landowners of the House of Commons and the greater landowners of the House of Lords . The resulting measures angered the peasants , leading to the Peasants ' Revolt of 1381 .
