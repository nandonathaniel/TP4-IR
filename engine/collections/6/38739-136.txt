The above generalizes easily to the case of taking the mean of vector - valued estimates . For example , estimates of position on a plane may have less certainty in one direction than another . As in the scalar case , the weighted mean of multiple estimates can provide a maximum likelihood estimate . We simply replace the variance σ 2 ( \ displaystyle \ sigma ^ ( 2 ) ) by the covariance matrix Σ ( \ displaystyle \ Sigma ) and the arithmetic inverse by the matrix inverse ( both denoted in the same way , via superscripts ) ; the weight matrix then reads :
