Two distinct functions -- first that of traction by adhesion as in an ordinary loco ; second that of traction by pinions acting on the track bars . The brakes are four in number -- two handbrakes , acting by friction ; and two acting by preventing the free escape of air from cylinder and thus using compressed air in retarding the progress of the engine . The former are used for shunting whilst the later for descending steep gradients . One of the handbrakes acts on the tyres of the wheels in the ordinary manner and the second acts on grooved surfaces of the pinion axle , but can be used in those places where the rack is laid .
