Disc brakes consist of a rotor and caliper at each wheel . Carbon composite rotors ( introduced by the Brabham team in 1976 ) are used instead of steel or cast iron because of their superior frictional , thermal , and anti-warping properties , as well as significant weight savings . These brakes are designed and manufactured to work in extreme temperatures , up to 1,000 degrees Celsius ( 1800 Â° F ) . The driver can control brake force distribution fore and aft to compensate for changes in track conditions or fuel load . Regulations specify this control must be mechanical , not electronic , thus it is typically operated by a lever inside the cockpit as opposed to a control on the steering wheel .
