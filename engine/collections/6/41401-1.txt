Initiation of translation in prokaryotes involves the assembly of the components of the translation system , which are : the two ribosomal subunits ( 50S and 30S subunits ) ; the mature mRNA to be translated ; the tRNA charged with N - formylmethionine ( the first amino acid in the nascent peptide ) ; guanosine triphosphate ( GTP ) as a source of energy , and the three prokaryotic initiation factors IF1 , IF2 , and IF3 , which help the assembly of the initiation complex . Variations in the mechanism can be anticipated .
