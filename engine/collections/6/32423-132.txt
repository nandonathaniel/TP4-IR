The Virginia Plan ( also known as the Large State Plan or the Randolph Plan ) proposed that the legislative department of the national government be composed of a Bicameral Congress , with both chambers elected with apportionment according to population . Generally favoring the most highly populated states , it used the philosophy of John Locke to rely on consent of the governed , Montesquieu for divided government , and Edward Coke to emphasize civil liberties . The New Jersey Plan proposed that the legislative department be a unicameral body with one vote per state . Generally favoring the less - populous states , it used the philosophy of English Whigs such as Edmund Burke to rely on received procedure and William Blackstone to emphasize sovereignty of the legislature . This position reflected the belief that the states were independent entities and , as they entered the United States of America freely and individually , remained so .
