Jesus says he is teaching in parables because he does not want everyone to understand him , only those who are his followers . Those outside the group are not meant to understand them . Thus one must already be committed to following Jesus to fully understand his message and that without that commitment one will never fully understand him or be helped by his message . If one does not correctly understand the parables , this is a sign that one is not a true disciple of Jesus . He quotes Isaiah 6 : 9 - 10 , who also preached to Israel knowing that his message would go unheeded and not understood so that the Israelites ' sins would not be forgiven and they would be punished by God for them . This parable seems to be essential for understanding all the rest of Jesus ' parables , as it makes clear that what is necessary to understand Jesus is a prior faith in him , and that Jesus will not enlighten those who refuse to believe , he will only confuse them .
