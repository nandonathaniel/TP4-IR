Ibuprofen is administered as a racemic mixture . The R - enantiomer undergoes extensive interconversion to the S - enantiomer in vivo . The S - enantiomer is believed to be the more pharmacologically active enantiomer . The R - enantiomer is converted through a series of three main enzymes . These enzymes include acyl - CoA - synthetase , which converts the R - enantiomer to ( - ) - R - ibuprofen I - CoA ; 2 - arylpropionyl - CoA epimerase , which converts ( - ) - R - ibuprofen I - CoA to ( + ) - S - Ibuprofen I - CoA ; and hydrolase , which converts ( + ) - S - ibuprofen I - CoA to the S - enantiomer . In addition to the conversion of ibuprofen to the S - enantiomer , the body can metabolize ibuprofen to several other compounds , including numerous hydroxyl , carboxyl and glucuronyl metabolites . Virtually all of these have no pharmacological effects .
