United States Steel Corporation , which was much larger than Standard Oil , won its antitrust suit in 1920 despite never having delivered the benefits to consumers that Standard Oil did . In fact , it lobbied for tariff protection that reduced competition , and so contending that it was one of the `` good trusts '' that benefited the economy is somewhat doubtful . Likewise International Harvester survived its court test , while other monopolies were broken up in tobacco , meatpacking , and bathtub fixtures . Over the years hundreds of executives of competing companies who met together illegally to fix prices went to federal prison .
