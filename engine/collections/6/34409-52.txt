The city sits in a saddle between the two mountains Machu Picchu and Huayna Picchu , with a commanding view down two valleys and a nearly impassable mountain at its back . It has a water supply from springs that can not be blocked easily . The hillsides leading to it were terraced , to provide more farmland to grow crops , and to steepen the slopes that invaders would have to ascend . The terraces reduced soil erosion and protected against landslides . Two high - altitude routes from Machu Picchu cross the mountains back to Cusco , one through the Sun Gate , and the other across the Inca bridge . Both could be blocked easily , should invaders approach along them .
