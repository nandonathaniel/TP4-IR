Initially international opinion was skeptical and Suez Canal Company shares did not sell well overseas . Britain , Austria , and Russia did not buy a significant number of shares . However , with assistance from the Cattaui banking family , and their relationship with James de Rothschild of the French House of Rothschild bonds and shares were successfully promoted in France and other parts of Europe . All French shares were quickly sold in France . A contemporary British skeptic claimed `` One thing is sure ... our local merchant community does n't pay practical attention at all to this grand work , and it is legitimate to doubt that the canal 's receipts ... could ever be sufficient to recover its maintenance fee . It will never become a large ship 's accessible way in any case . ''
