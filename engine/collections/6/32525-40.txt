Experimental evidence also suggests that gene expression can oscillate with the period seen in dividing wild - type cells independently of the CDK machinery . Orlando et al. used microarrays to measure the expression of a set of 1,271 genes that they identified as periodic in both wild type cells and cells lacking all S - phase and mitotic cyclins ( clb1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 ) . Of the 1,271 genes assayed , 882 continued to be expressed in the cyclin - deficient cells at the same time as in the wild type cells , despite the fact that the cyclin - deficient cells arrest at the border between G and S phase . However , 833 of the genes assayed changed behavior between the wild type and mutant cells , indicating that these genes are likely directly or indirectly regulated by the CDK - cyclin machinery . Some genes that continued to be expressed on time in the mutant cells were also expressed at different levels in the mutant and wild type cells . These findings suggest that while the transcriptional network may oscillate independently of the CDK - cyclin oscillator , they are coupled in a manner that requires both to ensure the proper timing of cell cycle events . Other work indicates that phosphorylation , a post-translational modification , of cell cycle transcription factors by Cdk1 may alter the localization or activity of the transcription factors in order to tightly control timing of target genes .
