Automatic vs. manual operation -- pump may be controlled automatically by a level switch . Power -- Sump pump motive power will vary from 1 / 4 horsepower to multiple horsepower . Head pressure -- The hydraulic head pressure of a sump pump describes the maximum height that the pump will move water . For instance , a sump pump with a 15 feet ( 4.6 m ) maximum head ( also called a shutoff head ) will raise water up 15 feet ( 4.6 m ) before it completely loses flow ... Power cord length -- Running a more powerful electrical motor a long distance from the main service panel will require heavier gauge wiring to assure sufficient voltage at the motor for proper pump performance . Phase and voltage -- Sump pumps powered from the AC mains are available with single - phase or three - phase induction motors , rated for 110 -- 120 , 220 -- 240 , or 460 volts . Three - phase power is typically not available in residential locations . Water level sensing switch type -- Pressure switches are fully enclosed , usually inside the pump body , making them immune to obstructions or floating debris in the sump basin . Float switches , particularly the types attached to the end of a short length of flexible electrical cable , can get tangled or obstructed , especially if the pump is prone to movement in the basin due to torque effects when starting and stopping . Pressure switches are typically factory set and not adjustable , while float switches can be adjusted in place to set the high and low water levels in the sump basin . There is a solid state switch utilizing field - effect technology , which will turn on and off the pump through use of an internal switch and a piggyback plug . Backup system and alarm for critical applications .
