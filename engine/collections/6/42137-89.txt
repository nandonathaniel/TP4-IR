In the 15th and 16th centuries , Spanish underwent a dramatic change in the pronunciation of its sibilant consonants , known in Spanish as the reajuste de las sibilantes , which resulted in the distinctive velar ( x ) pronunciation of the letter ⟨ j ⟩ and -- in a large part of Spain -- the characteristic interdental ( θ ) ( `` th - sound '' ) for the letter ⟨ z ⟩ ( and for ⟨ c ⟩ before ⟨ e ⟩ or ⟨ i ⟩ ) . See History of Spanish ( Modern development of the Old Spanish sibilants ) for details .
