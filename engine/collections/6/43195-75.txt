The wording of this clause caused much controversy at the time it was first used . When William Henry Harrison died in office , a debate arose over whether the Vice President would become President , or if he would just inherit the powers , thus becoming an Acting President . Harrison 's Vice President , John Tyler , believed that he had the right to become President . However , many Senators argued that he only had the right to assume the powers of the presidency long enough to call for a new election . Because the wording of the clause is so vague , it was impossible for either side to prove its point . Tyler took the Oath of Office as President , setting a precedent that made it possible for later Vice Presidents to ascend to the presidency unchallenged following the President 's death . The `` Tyler Precedent '' established that if the President dies , resigns or is removed from office , the Vice President becomes President .
