The Plague of Athens was an epidemic that devastated the city - state of Athens in ancient Greece during the second year of the Peloponnesian War ( 430 BC ) when an Athenian victory still seemed within reach . It is believed to have entered Athens through Piraeus , the city 's port and sole source of food and supplies . Much of the eastern Mediterranean also saw outbreak of the disease , albeit with less impact . The plague returned twice more , in 429 BC and in the winter of 427 / 426 BC . Some 30 pathogens have been suggested as causing the plague .
