Belichick 's defense held the Rams ' high - powered offense in check until the 4th quarter , but after trailing 17 -- 3 early in the quarter , St. Louis scored two touchdowns to tie the game at 17 -- 17 . With 1 : 30 to go and no timeouts , and with John Madden on the Fox Sports telecast opining that the Patriots should play for overtime , Brady calmly led New England 's offense downfield , missing on only one pass . The Patriots drove to the Rams ' 30 - yard line , setting up Adam Vinatieri , who won the game with a 48 - yard field goal as time expired , giving the Patriots their first Super Bowl win in the team 's 42nd season .
