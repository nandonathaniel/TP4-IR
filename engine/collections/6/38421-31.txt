The Dark Side of the Moon built upon experiments Pink Floyd had attempted in their previous live shows and recordings , but lacks the extended instrumental excursions which , according to critic David Fricke , had become characteristic of the band after founder member Syd Barrett left in 1968 . Gilmour , Barrett 's replacement , later referred to those instrumentals as `` that psychedelic noodling stuff '' , and with Waters cited 1971 's Meddle as a turning - point towards what would be realised on the album . The Dark Side of the Moon 's lyrical themes include conflict , greed , the passage of time , death , and insanity , the latter inspired in part by Barrett 's deteriorating mental state ; he had been the band 's principal composer and lyricist . The album is notable for its use of musique concr√®te and conceptual , philosophical lyrics , as found in much of the band 's other work .
