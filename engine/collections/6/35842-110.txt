Arnold Wesker 's play The Merchant tells the same story from Shylock 's point of view . In this retelling , Shylock and Antonio are fast friends bound by a mutual love of books and culture and a disdain for the crass anti-Semitism of the Christian community 's laws . They make the bond in defiant mockery of the Christian establishment , never anticipating that the bond might become forfeit . When it does , the play argues , Shylock must carry through on the letter of the law or jeopardise the scant legal security of the entire Jewish community . He is , therefore , quite as grateful as Antonio when Portia , as in Shakespeare 's play , shows the legal way out . The play received its American premiere on 16 November 1977 at New York 's Plymouth Theatre , with Joseph Leon as Shylock and Marian Seldes as Shylock 's sister Rivka . This production had a challenging history in previews on the road , culminating ( after the first night out of town in Philadelphia on 8 September 1977 ) with the death of the larger - than - life Broadway star Zero Mostel , who was initially cast as Shylock . The play 's author , Arnold Wesker , wrote a book chronicling the out - of - town tribulations that beset the play and Zero 's death called The Birth of Shylock and the Death of Zero Mostel .
