To find the perfect location to shoot the Amazon island of Themyscira , the birthplace of Wonder Woman herself , the film 's producers searched all over the world , finally settling on the Amalfi Coast : a stretch of coastline on the Tyrrhenian Sea , located in the Province of Salerno in Southern Italy . It was chosen because most beaches in the world that sit below big cliffs disappear beneath the tide for part of every day . Production designer Aline Bonetto and her location manager Charles Somers considered 47 countries and visited several of them before they found what they were looking for . Bonetto explained that , `` Italy had beautiful weather , a beautiful blue - green sea , not too much tide , not too much wave . Our effects team added some cliffs in post-production , and it was the perfect way to go '' .
