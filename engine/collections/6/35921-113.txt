Gus ( voiced by David Lynch ) -- He works as a bartender at the Broken Stool , before which he studied Drama at Northwestern University . Gus seems to be on good terms with Cleveland and his friends , giving them their drinks for free . However , he may just be unintelligent as he does not pay his mortgage on the bar , and learns quite a bit of bartending from the fourteen - year - old Cleveland Jr . Gus is also very lax , hiring Cleveland Jr. to work at his bar and letting people almost push him around . In `` A Nightmare on Grace Street '' , it is revealed that he uses parts of human corpses as the meat in the sandwiches served at his bar , possibly to save money on real meat . In `` Escape from Goochland '' , it is revealed that Gus is 117 years old . In `` The Hangover Part Tubbs '' , it is revealed that Gus also runs a restaurant called Gustavo 's on the second floor that is above the Broken Stool .
