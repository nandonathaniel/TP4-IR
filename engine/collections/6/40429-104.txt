In parliamentary systems , Cabinet Ministers are accountable to Parliament , but it is the prime minister who appoints and dismisses them . In the case of the United Kingdom and other countries with a monarchy , it is the monarch who appoints and dismisses ministers , on the advice of the prime minister . In turn the prime minister will resign if the government loses the confidence of the parliament ( or a part of it ) . Confidence can be lost if the government loses a vote of no confidence or , depending on the country , loses a particularly important vote in parliament , such as vote on the budget . When a government loses confidence , it stays in office until a new government is formed ; something which normally but not necessarily required the holding of a general election .
