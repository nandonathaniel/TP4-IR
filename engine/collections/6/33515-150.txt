Carry permits required ? Yes Yes CGS 29 -- 28 Shall - Issue , with Limited Discretion . Connecticut 's pistol permit law specifies that issuing authorities May - Issue pistol permits to qualified applicants , but the state 's courts have generally ruled that permits must be granted on a Shall - Issue basis to applicant 's meeting the state 's qualifications for a pistol permit , as Connecticut does not require an applicant to `` show good cause '' for needing a permit . Issuing local authorities have limited discretion to deny a permit when he or she has personal knowledge of the applicant 's character that would not otherwise be reflected on a background check . A denial on this basis would have to be justified with supporting evidence showing that the applicant is not of `` suitable '' character to be granted a pistol permit , but virtually all cases are thrown out if the applicant is not otherwise barred from owning firearms . Connecticut has a two - step permitting process : a 60 - day Temporary permit issued by local authorities and a 5 - year Regular permit issued by the Department of Emergency Services and Public Protection ( DESPP ) . Issuance of a Temporary permit is technically not a prerequisite to apply for a Regular permit , but in practice an applicant must await a decision from local authorities on the temporary permit application before applying to DESPP for the Regular permit . If the local permit is denied for any reason , instead one files an appeal to DESPP to have the state board re-examine the application . If the state board denies the permit ( rare occurrence ) , a court appeal is possible . Permit needed to carry open or concealed . Exceptions for peace officers and Active - Duty military members . Out of state permits not valid in Connecticut , but non-residents may apply for a Connecticut non-resident carry permit through the mail . Non-residents must have a carry permit issued by a United States jurisdiction to apply .
