First , the waves of Norse colonisation of northern parts of the British Isles in the 8th and 9th centuries put Old English into intense contact with Old Norse , a North Germanic language . Norse influence was strongest in the Northeastern varieties of Old English spoken in the Danelaw area around York , which was the centre of Norse colonisation ; today these features are still particularly present in Scots and Northern English . However the centre of norsified English seems to have been in the Midlands around Lindsey , and after 920 CE when Lindsey was reincorporated into the Anglo - Saxon polity , Norse features spread from there into English varieties that had not been in intense contact with Norse speakers . Some elements of Norse influence that persist in all English varieties today are the pronouns beginning with th - ( they , them , their ) which replaced the Anglo - Saxon pronouns with h - ( hie , him , hera ) .
