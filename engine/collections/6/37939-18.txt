Add : A and B are summed and the sum appears at Y and carry - out . Add with carry : A , B and carry - in are summed and the sum appears at Y and carry - out . Subtract : B is subtracted from A ( or vice versa ) and the difference appears at Y and carry - out . For this function , carry - out is effectively a `` borrow '' indicator . This operation may also be used to compare the magnitudes of A and B ; in such cases the Y output may be ignored by the processor , which is only interested in the status bits ( particularly zero and negative ) that result from the operation . Subtract with borrow : B is subtracted from A ( or vice versa ) with borrow ( carry - in ) and the difference appears at Y and carry - out ( borrow out ) . Two 's complement ( negate ) : A ( or B) is subtracted from zero and the difference appears at Y . Increment : A ( or B) is increased by one and the resulting value appears at Y . Decrement : A ( or B) is decreased by one and the resulting value appears at Y . Pass through : all bits of A ( or B) appear unmodified at Y . This operation is typically used to determine the parity of the operand or whether it is zero or negative , or to load the operand into a processor register .
