Some democratic peace researchers have been criticized for post hoc reclassifying some specific conflicts as non-wars or political systems as non-democracies without checking and correcting the whole data set used similarly . Supporters and opponents of the democratic peace agree that this is bad use of statistics , even if a plausible case can be made for the correction ( Bremer 1992 ) , ( Gleditsch 1995 ) , ( Gowa 1999 ) . A military affairs columnist of the newspaper Asia Times has summarized the above criticism in a journalist 's fashion describing the theory as subject to the no true Scotsman problem : exceptions are explained away as not being between `` real '' democracies or `` real '' wars .
