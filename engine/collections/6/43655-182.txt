Rule by a form of government in which the people , or some significant portion of them , have supreme control over the government and where offices of state are elected or chosen by elected people . A common simplified definition of a republic is a government where the head of state is not a monarch . Montesquieu included both democracies , where all the people have a share in rule , and aristocracies or oligarchies , where only some of the people rule , as republican forms of government .
