The respiratory segment comprises most of each nasal fossa and is lined with ciliated pseudostratified columnar epithelium ( also called respiratory epithelium ) . The conchae , or turbinates , are located in this region . The turbinates have a very vascularized lamina propria ( erectile tissue ) allowing the venous plexuses of their mucosa to engorge with blood , restricting airflow and causing air to be directed to the other side of the nose , which acts in concert by shunting blood out of its turbinates . This cycle occurs approximately every two and a half hours .
