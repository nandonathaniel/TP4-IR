That was a beat he found on SoundCloud by a producer who was pretty unknown ( BLVK ) and just blacked out for like 24 hours . He wrote and wrote and wrote to that loop . That was one song he expressed to me like , ' we got to make this worthy of an album . ' You ca n't just have an eight - minute song .
