Patty , you 're going further than I ever imagined . ' She said , ' She wants to provoke painful suffering , so she tested her own gas on her own face . She wanted to know how deep this form of her gas would go , so she put it on her own face . ' You can see half of her face is completely gone . This is the sadistic side of Dr. Maru '' .
