As of 2013 , the Astros ' new flagship radio station is KBME , Sportstalk 790AM ( a Fox Sports Radio affiliate ) , leaving KTRH , 740AM after a partnership with them since 1999 ( both stations are owned by iHeartMedia ) . This change suddenly made it difficult for listeners outside of Houston itself to hear the Astros , as KTRH runs 50 kilowatts of power day and night , and KBME runs only five kilowatts . As a result , KTRH is audible across much of Central , East , and South Texas , whereas KBME can only be heard in Houston , especially after dark . Milo Hamilton , a veteran voice who was on the call for Hank Aaron 's 715th career home run in 1974 , retired at the end of the 2012 season , after broadcasting play - by - play for the Astros since 1985 . Dave Raymond and Brett Dolan shared play - by play duty for road games , while Raymond additionally worked as Hamilton 's color analyst ( while Hamilton called home games only for the past few seasons before his retirement ) ; they were not retained and instead brought in Robert Ford and Steve Sparks to begin broadcasting for the 2013 season .
