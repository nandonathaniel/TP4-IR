Healey v. James ( 1972 ) found students have the right to self - determination . `` Students -- who , by reason of the 26th Amendment , become eligible to vote when 18 years of age -- are adults who are members of the college or university community . Their interests and concerns are often quite different from those of the faculty . They often have values , views , and ideologies that are at war with the ones which the college has traditionally espoused or indoctrinated . Bradshaw v. Rawlings ( 1979 ) found that `` adult students now demand and receive expanded rights of privacy in their college life '' .
