Antiochus III the Great attempted to project Seleucid power and authority into Hellenistic Greece , but his attempts were thwarted by the Roman Republic and Greek allies such as the Kingdom of Pergamon , culminating in a Seleucid defeat at the 190 BC Battle of Magnesia . In the subsequent Treaty of Apamea in 188 BC , the Seleucids were compelled to pay costly war reparations and relinquished claims to territories west of the Taurus Mountains . Much of the eastern part of the Seleucid Empire was conquered by the Parthians under Mithridates I of Parthia in the mid-2nd century BC . However , the Seleucid kings continued to rule a rump state from Syria until the invasion by Armenian king Tigranes the Great and their ultimate overthrow by the Roman general Pompey .
