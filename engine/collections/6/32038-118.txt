In Batman 's first appearance in Detective Comics # 27 , he is already operating as a crime - fighter . Batman 's origin is first presented in Detective Comics # 33 ( November 1939 ) and is later expanded upon in Batman # 47 . As these comics state , Bruce Wayne is born to Dr. Thomas Wayne and his wife Martha , two very wealthy and charitable Gotham City socialites . Bruce is brought up in Wayne Manor , and leads a happy and privileged existence until the age of eight , when his parents are killed by a small - time criminal named Joe Chill while on their way home from a movie theater . That night , Bruce Wayne swears an oath to spend his life fighting crime . He engages in intense intellectual and physical training ; however , he realizes that these skills alone would not be enough . `` Criminals are a superstitious cowardly lot '' , Wayne remarks , `` so my disguise must be able to strike terror into their hearts . I must be a creature of the night , black , terrible ... '' As if responding to his desires , a bat suddenly flies through the window , inspiring Bruce to craft the Batman persona .
