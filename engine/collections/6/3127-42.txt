`` Na Na Hey Hey Kiss Him Goodbye '' is a song written and recorded by Paul Leka , Gary DeCarlo and Dale Frashuer , attributed to a then - fictitious band they named `` Steam '' . It was released under the Mercury subsidiary label Fontana and became a number one pop single on the Billboard Hot 100 in late 1969 , and remained on the charts in early 1970 . In 1977 , Chicago White Sox organist Nancy Faust began playing the song when White Sox sluggers knocked out the opposing pitcher . The fans would sing and a sports ritual was born . The song 's chorus remains well - known , and is still frequently used as a crowd chant at many sporting events . It is generally directed at the losing side in an elimination contest when the outcome is all but certain or when an individual player is ejected or disqualified . It has also been observed by crowds in political rallies to drown out and mock disruptive protesters who are being escorted out by security .
