In Australia and New Zealand , the term SUV is not widely used , except by motoring organizations , the press , and industry bodies . Passenger class vehicles designed for off - road use are known as `` four - wheel drives '' , `` 4WDs '' , or `` 4 Ã— 4s '' . Some manufacturers do refer to their products as SUVs , but others invented names such as XUV , ( HSV Avalanche XUV or GMC Envoy XUV ) or action utility vehicles ( AUVs ) . The term `` AWD '' , or all - wheel drive , is used for any vehicle which drives on all four wheels , but may not be designed for off - road use . `` Crossover '' is a marketing term for a vehicle that is both four - wheel - drive and primarily a road car .
