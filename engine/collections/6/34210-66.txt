Regarded by many as one of the finest works in any language , El ingenioso hidalgo Don Quixote de la Mancha by Miguel de Cervantes was the first novel published in Europe ; it gave Cervantes a stature in the Spanish - speaking world comparable to his contemporary William Shakespeare in English . The novel , like Spain itself , was caught between the Middle Ages and the modern world . A veteran of the Battle of Lepanto ( 1571 ) , Cervantes had fallen on hard times in the late 1590s and was imprisoned for debt in 1597 , and some believe that during these years he began work on his best - remembered novel . The first part of the novel was published in 1605 ; the second in 1615 , a year before the author 's death . Don Quixote resembled both the medieval , chivalric romances of an earlier time and the novels of the early modern world . It parodied classical morality and chivalry , found comedy in knighthood , and criticized social structures and the perceived madness of Spain 's rigid society . The work has endured to the present day as a landmark in world literary history , and it was an immediate international hit in its own time , interpreted variously as a satirical comedy , social commentary and forbearer of self - referential literature .
