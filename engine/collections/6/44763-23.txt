Four days after Powers ' disappearance , NASA issued a very detailed press release noting that an aircraft had `` gone missing '' north of Turkey . The press release speculated that the pilot might have fallen unconscious while the autopilot was still engaged , even falsely claiming that `` the pilot reported over the emergency frequency that he was experiencing oxygen difficulties . '' To bolster this , a U-2 plane was quickly painted in NASA colors and shown to the media . Under the impression that the pilot had died and that the plane had been destroyed , the Americans had decided to use the NASA cover - up plan . Nikita Khrushchev used the American misstep to embarrass President Eisenhower and his administration .
