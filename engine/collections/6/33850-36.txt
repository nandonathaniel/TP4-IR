On May 24 , 1963 , Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy invited African - American novelist James Baldwin , along with a large group of cultural leaders , to a meeting in New York to discuss race relations . However , the meeting became antagonistic , as black delegates felt that Kennedy did not have a full understanding of the race problem in the nation . The public failure of the meeting , which came to be known as the Baldwin -- Kennedy meeting , underscored the divide between the needs of Black America and the understanding of Washington politicians . However , the meeting also provoked the Kennedy administration to take action on the civil rights for African - Americans . On June 11 , 1963 , President John F. Kennedy gave his famous civil rights address on national television and radio , announcing that he would begin to push for civil rights legislation -- the law which eventually became the Civil Rights Act of 1964 . That night , Mississippi activist Medgar Evers was murdered in his own driveway , further escalating national tension around the issue of racial inequality .
