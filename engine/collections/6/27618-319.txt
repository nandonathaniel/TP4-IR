The Battle of Burnt Corn , between Red Sticks and U.S. troops , occurred in the southern parts of Alabama on July 27 , 1813 . It prompted the state of Georgia as well as the Mississippi territory militia to immediately take major action against Creek offensives . The Red Sticks chiefs gained power in the east along the Alabama , Coosa , and Tallapoosa Rivers -- Upper Creek territory . The Lower Creek lived along the Chattahoochee River . Many Creeks tried to remain friendly to the United States , and some were organized by federal Indian Agent Benjamin Hawkins to aid the 6th Military District under General Thomas Pinckney and the state militias . The United States combined forces were large . At its peak the Red Stick faction had 4,000 warriors , only a quarter of whom had muskets .
