In recent years , there has been progress in the area of addressing customary practices that endanger women , with laws being enacted in several countries . The Inter-African Committee on Traditional Practices Affecting the Health of Women and Children is an NGO which works on changing social values , raising consciousness , and enacting laws against harmful traditions which affect the health of women and children in Africa . Laws were also enacted in some countries ; for example the 2004 Criminal Code of Ethiopia has a chapter on harmful traditional practices -- Chapter III -- Crimes committed against life , person and health through harmful traditional practices . In addition , the Council of Europe adopted a convention which addresses domestic violence and violence against women , and calls for the states which ratify it to create and fully adjudicate laws against acts of violence previously condoned by traditional , culture , custom , in the name of honor , or to correct what is deemed unacceptable behavior . The United Nations created the Handbook on effective police responses to violence against women to provide guidelines to address and manage violence through the creation of effective laws , law enforcement policies and practices and community activities to break down societal norms that condone violence , criminalize it and create effect support systems for survivors of violence .
