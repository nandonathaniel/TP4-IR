Assuming that the applicant again successfully satisfied the examiner that they were adequately prepared to continue , they will enter the aircraft . The examiner will usually give the applicant a list or oral briefing on what they want the applicant to do during the flight . For example , `` I want you to prepare for a VFR flight to Podunck County Airport at an altitude of 3,500 feet , and explain to me what steps you 're taking along the way . '' The examiner will then begin to assess the applicant as they proceed . At some point , however , the examiner may suddenly throw in distractors such as loss of radio communications , loss of instruments , flight into non-visual weather condition , or other emergency situations that the applicant must then respond to , all the while continuing the safe operation of the flight . After the emergency maneuvers are completed , the examiner will then have the applicant make several different landing approaches as well as different take off modes .
