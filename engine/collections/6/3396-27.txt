In 2000 , the De Beers business model changed because of factors such as the decision by producers in Canada and Australia to distribute diamonds outside the De Beers channel , as well as rising awareness of blood diamonds that forced De Beers to `` avoid the risk of bad publicity '' by limiting sales to its own mined products . De Beers ' market share of rough diamonds fell from as high as 90 % in the 1980s to 33 % in 2013 , because of a more fragmented diamond market bringing greater competition , as well as more transparency and greater liquidity . In November 2011 , the Oppenheimer family announced its intention to sell all its 40 % stake in De Beers to Anglo American plc , thereby increasing Anglo American 's ownership of the company to 85 % ( the other 15 % is owned by the Government of the Republic of Botswana ) . The transaction was worth Â£ 3.2 billion ( US $5.1 billion ) in cash and ended the Oppenheimer dynasty 's 80 - year ownership of De Beers .
