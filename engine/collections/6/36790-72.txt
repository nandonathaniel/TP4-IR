A right to be forgotten was replaced by a more limited right to erasure in the version of the GDPR that was adopted by the European Parliament in March 2014 . Article 17 provides that the data subject has the right to request erasure of personal data related to them on any one of a number of grounds , including noncompliance with Article 6.1 ( lawfulness ) that includes a case ( f ) if the legitimate interests of the controller is overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject , which require protection of personal data ( see also Google Spain SL , Google Inc. v Agencia Española de Protección de Datos , Mario Costeja González ) .
