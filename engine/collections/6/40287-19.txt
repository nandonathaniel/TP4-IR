Nearly a year after Maureen 's death , Rapp was recruited into the CIA by Irene Kennedy . He began training the week after graduating from Syracuse . Only twenty - three years old at the time , Rapp did not go through the standard CIA training program at `` The Farm '' , outside Williamsburg , Virginia . Instead , for a year straight he was shuttled from one location to the next , sometimes spending a week , sometimes a month . The bulk of the training was handled by Stan Hurley , a former CIA operative , who taught him `` how to shoot , stab , blow things up , and even kill with his bare hands '' . In other words , he was schooled in firearms and marksmanship , hand - to - hand combat , and explosives . Endurance was stressed . There were long swims and even longer runs . Between all the heavy lifting , they worked on his foreign language skills . Since he had minored in French at Syracuse , within a month at the CIA he was fluent in the language . He was then taught Arabic and Persian and can passably speak Urdu and Pashto . He also speaks German and Italian . He is ambidextrous , but naturally left - handed .
