Since the creation of the Football League in 1888 , the final has never been contested by two teams from outside the top division , and there have only been eight winners who were not in the top flight : Notts County ( 1894 ) ; Tottenham Hotspur ( 1901 ) ; Wolverhampton Wanderers ( 1908 ) ; Barnsley ( 1912 ) ; West Bromwich Albion ( 1931 ) ; Sunderland ( 1973 ) , Southampton ( 1976 ) and West Ham United ( 1980 ) . With the exception of Tottenham , these clubs were all playing in the second tier ( the old Second Division ) -- Tottenham were playing in the Southern League and were only elected to the Football League in 1908 , meaning they are the only non-League winners of the FA Cup since the League 's creation . Other than Tottenham 's victory , only 24 finalists have come from outside English football 's top tier , with a record of 7 wins and 17 runners - up : and none at all from the third tier or lower , Southampton ( 1902 , then in the Southern League ) being the last finalist from outside the top two tiers .
