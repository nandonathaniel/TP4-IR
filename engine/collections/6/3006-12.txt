The longest word in any of the major English language dictionaries is pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis , a word that refers to a lung disease contracted from the inhalation of very fine silica particles , specifically from a volcano ; medically , it is the same as silicosis . The word was deliberately coined to be the longest word in English , and has since been used in a close approximation of its originally intended meaning , lending at least some degree of validity to its claim .
