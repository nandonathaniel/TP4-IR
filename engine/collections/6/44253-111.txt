Although the African - American community quickly began litigation to challenge such provisions , in the 19th century Supreme Court challenges generally were not decided in their favor . The Supreme Court case of Plessy v. Ferguson ( 1896 ) upheld the segregation of races in schools as long as each race enjoyed parity in quality of education ( the `` separate but equal '' principle ) . However , few black students received equal education . They suffered for decades from inadequate funding , outmoded or dilapidated facilities , and deficient textbooks ( often ones previously used in white schools ) .
