Prototype spade money : This type of spade money is similar in shape and size to the original agricultural implements . While some are perhaps robust enough to be used in the fields , others are much lighter and bear an inscription , probably the name of the city which issued it . Some of these objects have been found in Shang and Western Zhou tombs , so they date from c. 1200 -- 800 BC . Inscribed specimens appear to date from c. 700 BC .
