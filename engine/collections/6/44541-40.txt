After migration of hepatoblasts into the septum transversum mesenchyme , the hepatic architecture begins to be established , with liver sinusoids and bile canaliculi appearing . The liver bud separates into the lobes . The left umbilical vein becomes the ductus venosus and the right vitelline vein becomes the portal vein . The expanding liver bud is colonized by hematopoietic cells . The bipotential hepatoblasts begin differentiating into biliary epithelial cells and hepatocytes . The biliary epithelial cells differentiate from hepatoblasts around portal veins , first producing a monolayer , and then a bilayer of cuboidal cells . In ductal plate , focal dilations emerge at points in the bilayer , become surrounded by portal mesenchyme , and undergo tubulogenesis into intrahepatic bile ducts . Hepatoblasts not adjacent to portal veins instead differentiate into hepatocytes and arrange into cords lined by sinudoidal epithelial cells and bile canaliculi . Once hepatoblasts are specified into hepatocytes and undergo further expansion , they begin acquiring the functions of a mature hepatocyte , and eventually mature hepatocytes appear as highly polarized epithelial cells with abundant glycogen accumulation . In the adult liver , hepatocytes are not equivalent , with position along the portocentrovenular axis within a liver lobule dictating expression of metabolic genes involved in drug metabolism , carbohydrate metabolism , ammonia detoxification , and bile production and secretion . WNT / Î² - catenin has now been identified to be playing a key role in this phenomenon .
