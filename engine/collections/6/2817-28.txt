The usual male headdress was the pudong , a turban , though in Panay both men and women also wore a head cloth or bandana called saplung . Commoners wore pudong of rough abaca cloth wrapped around only a few turns so that it was more of a headband than a turban and was therefore called pudong - pudong -- as the crowns and diadems on Christian images were later called . A red pudong was called magalong , and was the insignia of braves who had killed an enemy . The most prestigious kind of pudong , limited to the most valiant , was , like their G - strings , made of pinayusan , a gauze - thin abaca of fibers selected for their whiteness , tie - dyed a deep scarlet in patterns as fine as embroidery , and burnished to a silky sheen . Such pudong were lengthened with each additional feat of valor : real heroes therefore let one end hang loose with affected carelessness . Women generally wore a kerchief , called tubatub if it was pulled tight over the whole head ; but they also had a broad - brimmed hat called sayap or tarindak , woven of sago - palm leaves . Some were evidently signs of rank : when Humabon 's queen went to hear mass during Magellan 's visit , she was preceded by three girls carrying one of her hats . A headdress from Cebu with a deep crown , used by both sexes for travel on foot or by boat , was called sarok , which actually meant to go for water .
