The weather varies markedly according to elevation , and lack of precipitation , along with infertile soil , makes land at elevations higher than 400 meters unsuitable for purposes other than grazing . Precipitation is geographically and seasonally irregular , and in most parts of the country as much as half the annual rainfall occurs in the three summer months . This pattern favors the cultivation of paddy rice in warmer regions that are outfitted with irrigation and flood control networks . Rice yields are 5.3 tonnes per hectare , close to international norms . In 2005 , North Korea was ranked by the FAO as an estimated 10th in the production of fresh fruit and as an estimated 19th in the production of apples .
