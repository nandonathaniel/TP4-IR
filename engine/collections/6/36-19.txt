The US federal government has a similar law -- 49 CFR 392.14 -- which applies in all states as permitted under by the commerce clause and due process clause. ; for example California Vehicle Code section 22350 which states that `` No person shall drive a vehicle upon a highway at a speed greater than is reasonable ... and in no event at a speed which endangers the safety of persons or property '' .
