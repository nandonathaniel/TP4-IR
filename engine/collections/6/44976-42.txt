The limited effects of the local policies of the Alliance did little to address the overall problem of deflation and depressed agricultural prices . By 1886 , tensions had begun to form in the movement between the political activists , who promoted a national political agenda , and the political conservatives , who favored no change in national policy but a `` strictly business '' plan of local economic action . In Texas , the split reached a climax in August 1886 at the statewide convention in Cleburne . The political activists successfully lobbied for passage of a set of political demands that included support of the Knights of Labor and the Great Southwest Railroad Strike of 1886 . Other demands include changes in governmental land policy , and railroad regulation . The demands also included a demand for use of silver as legal tender , on the grounds that this would alleviate the contraction in the money supply that led to falling prices and scarcity of credit ( see gold standard ) .
