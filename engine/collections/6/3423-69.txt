Trump also claimed to own the painting Two Sisters ( On the Terrace ) , an 1881 work by French Impressionist artist Pierre - Auguste Renoir . The original work hangs in the Art Institute of Chicago . In October 2017 , Timothy L. O'Brien said that during his interviews with Trump for the book TrumpNation : The Art of Being The Donald , he asked Trump about the copy of Two Sisters , which was then on Trump 's plane . Trump repeatedly said that his copy was the genuine work , despite O'Brien's statements to the contrary . By then , the Renoir copy was hanging in Trump 's penthouse office . The Art Institute of Chicago released a statement refuting Trump 's claim that his Renoir copy was the genuine one .
