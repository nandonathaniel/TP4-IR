Extinction is the disappearance of an entire species . Extinction is not an unusual event , as species regularly appear through speciation and disappear through extinction . Nearly all animal and plant species that have lived on Earth are now extinct , and extinction appears to be the ultimate fate of all species . These extinctions have happened continuously throughout the history of life , although the rate of extinction spikes in occasional mass extinction events . The Cretaceous -- Paleogene extinction event , during which the non-avian dinosaurs became extinct , is the most well - known , but the earlier Permian -- Triassic extinction event was even more severe , with approximately 96 % of all marine species driven to extinction . The Holocene extinction event is an ongoing mass extinction associated with humanity 's expansion across the globe over the past few thousand years . Present - day extinction rates are 100 -- 1000 times greater than the background rate and up to 30 % of current species may be extinct by the mid 21st century . Human activities are now the primary cause of the ongoing extinction event ; global warming may further accelerate it in the future .
