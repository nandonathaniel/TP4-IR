The cosmic microwave background radiation is an emission of uniform , black body thermal energy coming from all parts of the sky . The radiation is isotropic to roughly one part in 100,000 : the root mean square variations are only 18 Î¼K , after subtracting out a dipole anisotropy from the Doppler shift of the background radiation . The latter is caused by the peculiar velocity of the Earth relative to the comoving cosmic rest frame as the planet moves at some 371 km / s towards the constellation Leo . The CMB dipole as well as aberration at higher multipoles have been measured , consistent with galactic motion .
