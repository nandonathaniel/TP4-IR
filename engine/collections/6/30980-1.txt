One of the first major studies of the middle class in America was White Collar : The American Middle Classes , published in 1951 by sociologist C. Wright Mills . Later sociologists such as Dennis Gilbert of Hamilton College commonly divide the middle class into two sub-groups . Constituting roughly 15 % to 20 % of households is the upper or professional middle class consisting of highly educated , salaried professionals and managers . Constituting roughly one third of households is the lower middle class consisting mostly of semi-professionals , skilled craftsmen and lower - level management . Middle - class persons commonly have a comfortable standard of living , significant economic security , considerable work autonomy and rely on their expertise to sustain themselves .
