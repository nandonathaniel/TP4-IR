As the 2009 -- 10 season began they started 19 -- 17 . Several trades were made by the team , one that sent Maynor and the contract of the retired Harpring to the Oklahoma City Thunder and another that sent starter Ronnie Brewer to the Memphis Grizzlies at mid-season , a trade which was openly criticized by Williams . The Brewer trade cleared the way for Matthews to take over his starter spot . Also , Williams was selected to play in the All - Star Game for the first time , and after a controversial off - season , Boozer played better than the year prior , averaging 19.5 points and 11.2 rebounds per game , and missed only four games to injury . He suggested that he would be happy to stay with Utah long - term . After returning from an early - season injury , Kyle Korver set the NBA record for three - point field goal percentage in a season .
