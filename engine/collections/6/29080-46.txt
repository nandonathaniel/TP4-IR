As bit cell size decreases , more data can be put onto a single drive platter . In 2013 , a production desktop 3 TB HDD ( with four platters ) would have had an areal density of about 500 Gbit / in which would have amounted to a bit cell comprising about 18 magnetic grains ( 11 by 1.6 grains ) . Since the mid-2000s areal density progress has increasingly been challenged by a superparamagnetic trilemma involving grain size , grain magnetic strength and ability of the head to write . In order to maintain acceptable signal to noise smaller grains are required ; smaller grains may self - reverse ( electrothermal instability ) unless their magnetic strength is increased , but known write head materials are unable to generate a magnetic field sufficient to write the medium . Several new magnetic storage technologies are being developed to overcome or at least abate this trilemma and thereby maintain the competitiveness of HDDs with respect to products such as flash memory - based solid - state drives ( SSDs ) .
