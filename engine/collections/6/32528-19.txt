People began to be alarmed . Samuel Pepys , who had an important position at the Admiralty , stayed in London and provided a contemporary account of the plague through his diary . On 30 April he wrote : `` Great fears of the sickness here in the City it being said that two or three houses are already shut up . God preserve us all ! '' Another source of information on the time is a fictional account , A Journal of the Plague Year , which was written by Daniel Defoe and published in 1722 . He had been only six when the plague struck but made use of his family 's recollections ( his uncle was a saddler in East London and his father a butcher in Cripplegate ) , interviews with survivors and sight of such official records as were available .
