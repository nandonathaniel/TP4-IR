Immediately after her initial solo feature ended , the Black Widow co-starred in Daredevil # 81 -- 124 ( Nov. 1971 -- Aug. 1975 ) , of which # 93 - 108 were cover titled Daredevil and the Black Widow . Daredevil writer Gerry Conway recounted , `` It was my idea to team up Daredevil and the Black Widow , mainly because I was a fan of Natasha , and thought she and Daredevil would have interesting chemistry . '' Succeeding writers , however , felt that Daredevil worked better as a solo hero , and gradually wrote the Black Widow out of the series . She was immediately recast into the super-team series The Champions as the leader of the titular superhero group , which ran for 17 issues ( Oct. 1975 -- Jan. 1978 ) .
