The British and colonists triumphed jointly over a common foe . The colonists ' loyalty to the mother country was stronger than ever before . However , disunity was beginning to form . British Prime Minister William Pitt the Elder had decided to wage the war in the colonies with the use of troops from the colonies and tax funds from Britain itself . This was a successful wartime strategy but , after the war was over , each side believed that it had borne a greater burden than the other . The British elite , the most heavily taxed of any in Europe , pointed out angrily that the colonists paid little to the royal coffers . The colonists replied that their sons had fought and died in a war that served European interests more than their own . This dispute was a link in the chain of events that soon brought about the American Revolution .
