The change in free energy , ΔG , for each step in the glycolysis pathway can be calculated using ΔG = ΔG ° ' + RTln Q , where Q is the reaction quotient . This requires knowing the concentrations of the metabolites . All of these values are available for erythrocytes , with the exception of the concentrations of NAD and NADH . The ratio of NAD to NADH in the cytoplasm is approximately 1000 , which makes the oxidation of glyceraldehyde - 3 - phosphate ( step 6 ) more favourable .
