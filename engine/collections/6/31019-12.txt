Speedwell and Acorn : Outskirters from Sandleford who join up with Hazel 's band and early in the journey side with Hawkbit when he wants to go back ; but , like him , they are subdued by Bigwig and consequently have a change of heart . Both develop into reliable and loyal sentries . Speedwell is subsequently characterised as an energetic , easy - going joker who later makes a loyal and hard - working contribution to the defence of the warren against General Woundwort . Speedwell is the narrator of one of the short stories in Tales from Watership Down , the nonsense tale Speedwell 's Story . Acorn does n't really get a very strong characterization , though he is mentioned as being one of the most skilled rabbits when it comes to gathering bugs for the wounded Kehaar , and is unflaggingly loyal to Hazel in the battle of the warren against Woundwort . In Tales from Watership Down he dies due to wintertime hardship , and is as such the only one of Hazel 's original crew to actually die over the course of the two books ( not counting Hazel 's own death many years later in the epilogue ) .
