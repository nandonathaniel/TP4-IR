Dartmoor Wildlife Park became the subject of local debate after a 2001 report by the Captive Animals Protection Society raised questions about the welfare of the animals and the conditions in which they were kept . The group criticised the living conditions for the animals and the safety barriers , calling for the zoo 's licence to be revoked . Ellis Daw denied the allegations , pointing to the lack of accidents in the zoo 's 33 - year history . The council were reluctant to revoke the zoo 's licence , due to concerns over the future of the animals , but did charge Ellis Daw with 16 offences after the zoo was investigated . All but one of these charges were dropped , but Daw was found guilty of breeding Siberian tigers outside of an organised breeding programme , and of keeping them in poor conditions . For this , Daw received a Â£ 200 fine and a conditional discharge , and the tigers were sent to a wildlife centre in the Netherlands .
