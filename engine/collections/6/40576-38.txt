Euthyphro has come to present charges of murder against his father , who had allowed one of his workers to die of exposure to the elements without proper care and attention . ( 3e -- 4d ) The dead worker , earlier had killed a slave from the family estate on Naxos Island . As Euthyphro 's father awaited to hear from the exegetes ( cf . Laws 759d ) about how to proceed , the bound - and - gagged worker died in a ditch . Socrates is astonished by Euthyphro 's confidence in being able to prosecute his own father for the serious charge of manslaughter , despite the fact that Athenian Law allows only relatives of the dead man to file suit for murder . ( Dem. 43 ยง 57 ) Euthyphro dismisses the astonishment of Socrates , which confirms his overconfidence in his own critical judgement of matters religious and ethical .
