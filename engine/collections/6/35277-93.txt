Property : the physical residence being financed . The exact form of ownership will vary from country to country , and may restrict the types of lending that are possible . Mortgage : the security interest of the lender in the property , which may entail restrictions on the use or disposal of the property . Restrictions may include requirements to purchase home insurance and mortgage insurance , or pay off outstanding debt before selling the property . Borrower : the person borrowing who either has or is creating an ownership interest in the property . Lender : any lender , but usually a bank or other financial institution . ( In some countries , particularly the United States , Lenders may also be investors who own an interest in the mortgage through a mortgage - backed security . In such a situation , the initial lender is known as the mortgage originator , which then packages and sells the loan to investors . The payments from the borrower are thereafter collected by a loan servicer . ) Principal : the original size of the loan , which may or may not include certain other costs ; as any principal is repaid , the principal will go down in size . Interest : a financial charge for use of the lender 's money . Foreclosure or repossession : the possibility that the lender has to foreclose , repossess or seize the property under certain circumstances is essential to a mortgage loan ; without this aspect , the loan is arguably no different from any other type of loan . Completion : legal completion of the mortgage deed , and hence the start of the mortgage . Redemption : final repayment of the amount outstanding , which may be a `` natural redemption '' at the end of the scheduled term or a lump sum redemption , typically when the borrower decides to sell the property . A closed mortgage account is said to be `` redeemed '' .
