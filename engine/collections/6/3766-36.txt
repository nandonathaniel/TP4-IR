By the 1530s , Mexico City was given jurisdiction over other town councils of New Spain and quickly established itself as the most populous and powerful city in the Americas . Like that of the Aztecs , the Spaniards ' grasp extended well beyond the capital and the Valley of Mexico -- only much farther . As the site of the viceroyalty of New Spain and archbishopric of Mexico , as well as economic elites , Mexico City was the center of power . Socially , the viceregal government and ecclesiastical authorities remained the pillars of Spanish colonialism . Its prestige as representing civilization allowed the colonial system to function during the long period from the 1640s to the 1760s when crown authorities in Mexico City were too weak politically to regulate much of the economic activities over such a vast territory . These institutions ' close association with Mexico City also ensured this city 's dominance in the political territory of New Spain , providing the links that kept the vast and expanding empire together .
