In his review of the 2006 remastered release , for Q magazine , Tom Doyle praised the album 's ballads , such as `` The Light That Has Lighted the World '' and `` Be Here Now '' , and suggested that `` the distance of time helps to reveal its varied charms '' . Mojo 's Mat Snow wrote of `` this long overdue reissue '' being `` worth it alone for four wonderful songs '' , including `` Do n't Let Me Wait Too Long '' and `` The Day the World Gets ' Round '' , and concluded : `` The rest is Hari Georgeson at his most preachy , but it 's never less than musical and often light on its feet . '' In another 2006 review , for the Vintage Rock website , Shawn Perry wrote of Material World being `` more restrained and immediate without the wall of sound whitewash of its predecessor , but its flow and elegance are unmistakable '' . Perry admired Harrison 's slide guitar playing and rated the album an `` underrated , classic record '' . Writing for Uncut in 2008 , David Cavanagh described Material World as `` a bit full - on , religion-wise '' but `` the album to play if you want musicianship at its best '' .
