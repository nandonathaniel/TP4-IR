Petre Vasiliu - NÄƒsturel observes that from a heraldic point of view , on the French as well as the revolutionary Wallachian flag , the middle stripe represents a heraldic metal ( argent and or respectively ) , thus , the two flags could be related . Other historians believe that the tricolor was not an imitation of the French flag , instead embodying an old Romanian tradition . This theory is supported by a note from the revolutionary minister of foreign affairs to Emin Pasha : `` the colors of the band that we , the leaders , wear , as well as all our followers , are not of modern origin . We have had our flags since an earlier time . When we received the tricolor insignia and bands we did not follow the spirit of imitation or fashion '' . The same minister assured the extraordinary envoy of the Porte , Suleiman Pasha , that the flag 's three colors had existed `` for a long time ; our ancestors bore them on their standard and their flags . So they are not a borrowing or an imitation from the present or a threat for the future '' .
