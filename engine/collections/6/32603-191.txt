Bills ( that mature into gold coin ) and gold certificates ( convertible into gold coin at the issuing bank ) added to the circulating stock of gold standard money in most 19th century industrial economies . In preparation for World War I the warring nations moved to fractional gold standards , inflating their currencies to finance the war effort . Post-war , the victorious countries , most notably Britain , gradually restored gold - convertibility , but international flows of gold via bills of exchange remained embargoed ; international shipments were made exclusively for bilateral trades or to pay war reparations .
