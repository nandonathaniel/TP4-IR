While river quality is threatened by pollution , including overflow sewage from Indianapolis and other cities , many recreational activities take place on the White River , including fishing , kayaking , and canoeing . The White River Yacht Club is a boating club that utilizes pontoon boats , and a section of the river in northern Indianapolis has both riverside cottages and pontoon boats . The river is n't deep enough in many stretches to support conventionally - keeled sailing or power boats .
