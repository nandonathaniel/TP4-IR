Major eukaryotic organelles Organelle Main function Structure Organisms Notes chloroplast ( plastid ) photosynthesis , traps energy from sunlight double - membrane compartment plants , protists ( rare kleptoplastic organisms ) has own DNA ; theorized to be engulfed by the ancestral eukaryotic cell ( endosymbiosis ) endoplasmic reticulum translation and folding of new proteins ( rough endoplasmic reticulum ) , expression of lipids ( smooth endoplasmic reticulum ) single - membrane compartment all eukaryotes rough endoplasmic reticulum is covered with ribosomes , has folds that are flat sacs ; smooth endoplasmic reticulum has folds that are tubular flagellum locomotion , sensory some eukaryotes Golgi apparatus sorting , packaging , processing and modification of proteins single - membrane compartment all eukaryotes cis - face ( convex ) nearest to rough endoplasmic reticulum ; trans - face ( concave ) farthest from rough endoplasmic reticulum mitochondrion energy production from the oxidation of glucose substances and the release of adenosine triphosphate double - membrane compartment most eukaryotes constituting element of the chondriome ; has own DNA ; theorized to be engulfed by an ancestral eukaryotic cell ( endosymbiosis ) nucleus DNA maintenance , controls all activities of the cell , RNA transcription double - membrane compartment all eukaryotes contains bulk of genome vacuole storage , transportation , helps maintain homeostasis single - membrane compartment eukaryotes
