In early 1976 , shortly after Fertel signed a new ten - year lease on the restaurant , a fire destroyed the building . Fertel had recently acquired a second property nearby to rent out as party space . Within seven days , she had relocated the restaurant to its new location a few blocks away at 711 North Broad Street and re-opened it , expanding to 160 seats in the process . The sales agreement with Matulich prevented her from using the original name at any other address , so she named the new restaurant Ruth 's Chris Steak House in order to keep some continuity with the previous location . She admitted later to Fortune Magazine that `` I 've always hated the name , but we 've always managed to work around it . ''
