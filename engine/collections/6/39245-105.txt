After a 10 - 6 season in 1986 , the Rams were booted from the playoffs by Washington . After one game of the 1987 season was lost to the players ' strike , the NFL employed substitutes , most of which were given derogatory nicknames ( in this case the Los Angeles Shams ) . After a 2 - 1 record , the Rams ' regulars returned , but the team only went 6 - 9 and did not qualify for the postseason .
