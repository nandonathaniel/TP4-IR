There are a number of subspecies , some of doubtful status , which are mostly quite similar in appearance , but the bicolored blackbird A. p. gubernator of California and central Mexico -- two isolated populations -- is distinctive : the male lacks the yellow wing patch of the nominate race , and the female is much darker than the female nominate . The taxonomy of this form is little understood , with the relationships between these two populations , and between them and red - winged blackbirds , still unclear . Despite the similar names , the red - winged blackbird is in a different family from the European redwing and the Old World common blackbird , which are thrushes ( Turdidae ) .
