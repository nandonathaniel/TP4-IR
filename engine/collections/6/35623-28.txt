In a legal case in 1608 that came to be known as Calvin 's Case , or the Case of the Postnati , the Law Lords decided in 1608 that Scotsmen born after King James I united Scotland and England ( the postnati ) had all the rights of Englishmen . This decision would have a subsequent effect on the concept of the `` rights of Englishmen '' in British America . Some scholars believed that the case did not fit British America 's situation , and thus reasoned that the 18th century colonists could `` claim all the rights and protections of English citizenship .
