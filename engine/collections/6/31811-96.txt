In primates , the pelvis consists of four parts - the left and the right hip bones which meet in the mid-line ventrally and are fixed to the sacrum dorsally and the coccyx . Each hip bone consists of three components , the ilium , the ischium , and the pubis , and at the time of sexual maturity these bones become fused together , though there is never any movement between them . In humans , the ventral joint of the pubic bones is closed .
