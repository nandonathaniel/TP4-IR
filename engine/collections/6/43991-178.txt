The United States had been running a trade deficit , draining gold out of the country . Because of the tariff revenues , the U.S. Treasury held a considerable amount of gold , which kept it out of circulation . On September 12 , the SS Central America , which was carrying $1.5 million in gold from California , sank , contributing to the panic . Secretary of the Treasury Howell Cobb came to the aid of New York mercantile interests by buying back some of the national debt . On September 25 the Bank of Pennsylvania suspended specie payment , starting a nationwide bank run .
