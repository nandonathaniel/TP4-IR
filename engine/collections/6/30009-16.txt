In Detective Comics # 235 ( 1956 ) , Batman learns that Chill was not a mere mugger , but actually a hitman who murdered the Waynes on orders from a mob boss named Lew Moxon . Batman also deduced that was why he himself was left unharmed by Chill : so he would unwittingly support Moxon 's alibi that he had nothing to do with a robbery that became a felony murder .
