The settlers came from all over the Swedish realm . The percentage of Finns in New Sweden grew especially towards the end of the colonization , comprising 22 % of the population during Swedish rule , but rising to about 50 % after the colony came under Dutch rule . The year 1664 saw the arrival of a contingent of 140 Finns . In 1655 , when the ship Mercurius sailed to the colony , 92 of the 106 passengers were listed as Finns . Memory of the early Finnish settlement lived on in place names near the Delaware River such as Finland ( Marcus Hook ) , Torne , Lapland , Finns Point and Mullica Hill and Mullica River .
