Structural alignments are used as the `` gold standard '' in evaluating alignments for homology - based protein structure prediction because they explicitly align regions of the protein sequence that are structurally similar rather than relying exclusively on sequence information . However , clearly structural alignments can not be used in structure prediction because at least one sequence in the query set is the target to be modeled , for which the structure is not known . It has been shown that , given the structural alignment between a target and a template sequence , highly accurate models of the target protein sequence can be produced ; a major stumbling block in homology - based structure prediction is the production of structurally accurate alignments given only sequence information .
