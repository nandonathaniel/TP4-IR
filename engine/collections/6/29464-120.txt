The USPIS has the power to enforce the USPS monopoly by conducting search and seizure raids on entities they suspect of sending non-urgent mail through overnight delivery competitors . According to the American Enterprise Institute , a private conservative think tank , the USPIS raided Equifax offices in 1993 to ascertain if the mail they were sending through Federal Express was truly `` extremely urgent . '' It was found that the mail was not , and Equifax was fined $30,000 .
