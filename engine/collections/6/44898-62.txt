Roosevelt entered office without a specific set of plans for dealing with the Great Depression -- so he improvised as Congress listened to a very wide variety of voices . Among Roosevelt 's more famous advisers was an informal `` Brain Trust '' , a group that tended to view pragmatic government intervention in the economy positively . His choice for Secretary of Labor , Frances Perkins , greatly influenced his initiatives . Her list of what her priorities would be if she took the job illustrates : `` a forty - hour workweek , a minimum wage , worker 's compensation , unemployment compensation , a federal law banning child labor , direct federal aid for unemployment relief , Social Security , a revitalized public employment service and health insurance '' .
