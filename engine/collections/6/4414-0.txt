`` '' Sonnet 18 Sonnet 18 in the 1609 Quarto of Shakespeare 's sonnets Q1 Q2 Q3 Shall I compare thee to a summer 's day ? Thou art more lovely and more temperate : Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May , And summer 's lease hath all too short a date : Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines , And often is his gold complexion dimm 'd ; And every fair from fair sometime declines , By chance , or nature 's changing course , untrimm 'd : But thy eternal summer shall not fade , Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow'st ; Nor shall Death brag thou wander'st in his shade , When in eternal lines to time thou grow'st : So long as men can breathe , or eyes can see , So long lives this , and this gives life to thee . 8 12 14 -- William Shakespeare
