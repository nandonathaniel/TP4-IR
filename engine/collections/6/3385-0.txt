In cell biology , mitosis is a part of the cell cycle when replicated chromosomes are separated into two new nuclei . In general , mitosis ( division of the nucleus ) is preceded by the S stage of interphase ( during which the DNA is replicated ) and is often accompanied or followed by cytokinesis , which divides the cytoplasm , organelles and cell membrane into two new cells containing roughly equal shares of these cellular components . Mitosis and cytokinesis together define the mitotic ( M ) phase of an animal cell cycle -- the division of the mother cell into two daughter cells genetically identical to each other .
