Machin reached 100 digits of π with this formula . Other mathematicians created variants , now known as Machin - like formulae , that were used to set several successive records for calculating digits of π . Machin - like formulae remained the best - known method for calculating π well into the age of computers , and were used to set records for 250 years , culminating in a 620 - digit approximation in 1946 by Daniel Ferguson -- the best approximation achieved without the aid of a calculating device .
