Birmingham : Confederate Soldiers and Sailors Monument , Linn Park , completed in 1905 by UDC , Pelham Chapter No. 67 . In August 2017 Birmingham Mayor William A. Bell ordered the monument covered in plastic and surrounded by plywood , acknowledging state law prohibits removing it , but arguing the law does not prohibit covering it up . He said : `` This country should in no way tolerate the hatred that the KKK , neo-Nazis , fascists and other hate groups spew . The God I know does n't put one race over another . '' The Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall sued the Mayor and the City over the action .
