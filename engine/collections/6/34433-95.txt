Although Allosaurus may have hunted in packs , it has been argued that Allosaurus and other theropods had largely aggressive interactions instead of cooperative interactions with other members of their own species . The study in question noted that cooperative hunting of prey much larger than an individual predator , as is commonly inferred for theropod dinosaurs , is rare among vertebrates in general , and modern diapsid carnivores ( including lizards , crocodiles , and birds ) rarely cooperate to hunt in such a way . Instead , they are typically territorial and will kill and cannibalize intruders of the same species , and will also do the same to smaller individuals that attempt to eat before they do when aggregated at feeding sites . According to this interpretation , the accumulation of remains of multiple Allosaurus individuals at the same site , e.g. in the Cleveland -- Lloyd Quarry , are not due to pack hunting , but to the fact that Allosaurus individuals were drawn together to feed on other disabled or dead allosaurs , and were sometimes killed in the process . This could explain the high proportion of juvenile and subadult allosaurs present , as juveniles and subadults are disproportionally killed at modern group feeding sites of animals like crocodiles and Komodo dragons . The same interpretation applies to Bakker 's lair sites . There is some evidence for cannibalism in Allosaurus , including Allosaurus shed teeth found among rib fragments , possible tooth marks on a shoulder blade , and cannibalized allosaur skeletons among the bones at Bakker 's lair sites .
