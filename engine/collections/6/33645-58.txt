The ship was completed and turned over to Royal Caribbean on 28 October 2009 . Two days later , she departed Finland for the United States . While exiting the Baltic Sea , the vessel passed underneath the Great Belt Fixed Link in Denmark on 31 October 2009 at 23 : 18 UTC . The bridge has a clearance of 65 m ( 213 ft ) above the water ; Oasis normally has an air draft of 72 m ( 236 ft ) . The passage under the bridge was possible due to retraction of the telescoping funnels , and an additional 30 cm ( 12 in ) was gained by the squat effect whereby vessels traveling at speed in a shallow channel will be drawn deeper into the water . Approaching the bridge at 23 knots ( 43 km / h ; 26 mph ) , the ship passed under it with less than 60 centimetres ( 2 ft ) of clearance .
