Curtis Roads ( Roads 2001 ) takes a wider view by distinguishing nine - time scales , this time in order of decreasing duration . The first two , the infinite and the supra musical , encompass natural periodicities of months , years , decades , centuries , and greater , while the last three , the sample and subsample , which take account of digital and electronic rates `` too brief to be properly recorded or perceived '' , measured in millionths of seconds ( microseconds ) , and finally the infinitesimal or infinitely brief , are again in the extra-musical domain . Roads ' Macro level , encompassing `` overall musical architecture or form '' roughly corresponds to Moravcsik 's `` very long '' division while his Meso level , the level of `` divisions of form '' including movements , sections , phrases taking seconds or minutes , is likewise similar to Moravcsik 's `` long '' category . Roads ' Sound object ( Schaeffer 1959 ; Schaeffer 1977 ) : `` a basic unit of musical structure '' and a generalization of note ( Xenakis ' mini structural time scale ) ; fraction of a second to several seconds , and his Microsound ( see granular synthesis ) down to the threshold of audible perception ; thousands to millionths of seconds , are similarly comparable to Moravcsik 's `` short '' and `` supershort '' levels of duration .
