In 1963 Archer was offered a place at the Oxford University Department for Continuing Education to study for a Diploma of Education . The course was based in the department , and Archer became a member of Brasenose College . There have been claims that Archer provided false evidence of his academic qualifications to Brasenose College : for instance , the apparent citing of an American institution which was actually a bodybuilding club , in gaining admission to the course . It has also been alleged Archer provided false statements about three non-existent A-level passes and a U.S. university degree . Although the diploma course only lasted a year , Archer spent a total of three years at Oxford .
