Francis Galton 's ( 1822 -- 1911 ) anthropometric laboratory opened in 1884 . There people were tested on a wide variety of physical ( e.g. , strength of blow ) and perceptual ( e.g. , visual acuity ) attributes . In 1886 Galton was visited by James McKeen Cattell who would later adapt Galton 's techniques in developing his own mental testing research program in the United States . Galton was not primarily a psychologist , however . The data he accumulated in the anthropometric laboratory primarily went toward supporting his case for eugenics . To help interpret the mounds of data he accumulated , Galton developed a number of important statistical techniques , including the precursors to the scatterplot and the product - moment correlation coefficient ( later perfected by Karl Pearson , 1857 -- 1936 ) .
