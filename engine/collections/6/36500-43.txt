Fomalhaut b : On November 13 , NASA and the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory announced the discovery of an extrasolar planet orbiting just inside the debris ring of the A class star Fomalhaut ( Alpha Piscis Austrini ) . This was the first extrasolar planet to be directly imaged by an optical telescope . Its mass is estimated to be three times that of Jupiter . Based on the planet 's unexpected brightness at visible wavelengths , the discovery team suspects it is surrounded by its own large disk or ring that may be a satellite system in the process of formation .
