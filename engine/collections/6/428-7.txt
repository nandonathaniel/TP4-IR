In 1897 , electric cars found their first commercial use in the USA . Based on the design of the Electrobat II , a fleet of twelve hansom cabs and one brougham were used in New York City as part of a project funded in part by the Electric Storage Battery Company of Philadelphia . During the 20th century , the main manufacturers of electric vehicles in the US were Anthony Electric , Baker , Columbia , Anderson , Edison , Riker , Milburn , Bailey Electric and others . Unlike gasoline - powered vehicles , the electric ones were less fast and less noisy , and did not require gear changes .
