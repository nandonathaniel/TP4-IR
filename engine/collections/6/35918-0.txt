The Abrahamic religions , also referred to collectively as Abrahamism , are a group of Semitic - originated religious sects that claim descent from the practices of the ancient Israelites and the worship of the God of Abraham . The term derives from a figure from the Bible known as Abraham . Abrahamic religion was able to spread globally through Christianity being adopted by the Roman Empire in the 4th century and the Islamic Empire from the 7th century onward . As a consequence , today the Abrahamic religions are one of the major divisions in comparative religion ( along with Indian , Iranian , and East Asian religions ) . Judaism , Christianity , and Islam are the largest Abrahamic religions in terms of numbers of adherents .
