Two other tree forms are notable in Western Australia and described using the native names `` mallet '' and `` marlock '' . The `` mallet '' is a small to medium - sized tree that does not produce lignotubers and has a relatively long trunk , a steeply branching habit and often a conspicuously dense terminal crown . This is the normal habit of mature healthy specimens of Eucalyptus occidentalis , E. astringens , E. spathulata , E. gardneri , E. dielsii , E. forrestiana , E. salubris , E. clivicola , and E. ornata . The smooth bark of mallets often has a satiny sheen and may be white , cream , grey , green , or copper .
