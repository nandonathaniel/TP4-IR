Article 19 of the Franco - German armistice required the French state to turn over to German authorities any German national on French territory , who would then frequently face deportation to a concentration camp ( the `` Surrender on Demand '' clause ) . Keitel gave verbal assurances that this would apply mainly to those refugees who had `` fermented the war '' , a euphemism for Jews , and especially German Jews who until then had enjoyed asylum in France . Keitel also made one other concession , that French aircraft need not be handed over to the Germans .
