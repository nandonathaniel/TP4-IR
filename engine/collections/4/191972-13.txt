High concentrations of potassium ( K ) also causes the muscle cells to decrease in efficiency , causing cramping and fatigue . Potassium builds up in the t - tubule system and around the muscle fiber as a result of action potentials . The shift in K changes the membrane potential around the muscle fiber . The change in membrane potential causes a decrease in the release of calcium ( Ca ) from the sarcoplasmic reticulum .
