In order to fund online and print publications , journalists are enlisting the help of crowdfunding . Crowdfunding allows for small start - ups and individual journalists to fund their work without the institutional help of major public broadcasters . Stories are publicly pitched using crowdfunding platforms such as Kickstarter , Indiegogo , or Spot.us . The funds collected from crowdsourcing may be put toward travel expenses or purchasing equipment . Crowdfunding in journalism may also be viewed as a way to allow audiences to participate in news production and in creating a participatory culture . Though deciding which stories are published is a role that traditionally belongs to editors at more established publications , crowdfunding can give the public an opportunity to provide input in deciding which stories are reported . This is done by funding certain reporters and their pitches . Donating can be seen as an act that `` bonds '' reporters and their readers . This is because readers are expressing interest for their work , which can be `` personally motivating '' or `` gratifying '' for reporters .
