George Whitefield first came to America in 1738 to preach in Georgia and found Bethesda Orphanage . Whitefield returned to the Colonies in November 1739 . His first stop was in Philadelphia where he initially preached at Christ Church , Philadelphia 's Anglican church , and then preached to a large outdoor crowd from the courthouse steps . He then preached in many Presbyterian churches . From Philadelphia , Whitefield traveled to New York and then to the South . In the Middle Colonies , he was popular in the Dutch and German communities as well as among the British . Lutheran pastor Henry Muhlenberg told of a German woman who heard Whitefield preach and , though she spoke no English , later said she had never before been so edified .
