Aldrich 's bill met much opposition from politicians . Critics charged Aldrich of being biased due to his close ties to wealthy bankers such as J.P. Morgan and John D. Rockefeller , Jr. , Aldrich 's son - in - law . Most Republicans favored the Aldrich Plan , but it lacked enough support in Congress to pass because rural and western states viewed it as favoring the `` eastern establishment '' . In contrast , progressive Democrats favored a reserve system owned and operated by the government ; they believed that public ownership of the central bank would end Wall Street 's control of the American currency supply . Conservative Democrats fought for a privately owned , yet decentralized , reserve system , which would still be free of Wall Street 's control .
