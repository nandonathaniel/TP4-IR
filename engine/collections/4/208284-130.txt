The analgesic effects of N O are linked to the interaction between the endogenous opioid system and the descending noradrenergic system . When animals are given morphine chronically , they develop tolerance to its pain - killing effects , and this also renders the animals tolerant to the analgesic effects of N O. Administration of antibodies that bind and block the activity of some endogenous opioids ( not Î² - endorphin ) also block the antinociceptive effects of N O. Drugs that inhibit the breakdown of endogenous opioids also potentiate the antinociceptive effects of N O. Several experiments have shown that opioid receptor antagonists applied directly to the brain block the antinociceptive effects of N O , but these drugs have no effect when injected into the spinal cord .
