Note that the NFL did not institute a permanent playoff tournament until 1967 and that the NFL Championship Game and any impromptu one - game playoffs ( played only in the event of a tie atop the division standings ) were the only postseason matchups in this era ( the Bert Bell Benefit Bowl is considered an exhibition game for the purpose of this list ) .
