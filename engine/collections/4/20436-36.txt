The first number is the number of goals ( six points ) scored , the second number is the number of behinds ( one point ) scored , and the final number is the total score . The final result is decided on the total score only : a team may win the game despite scoring fewer goals ( e.g. 13.21 ( 99 ) def. 14.9 ( 93 ) ) ; and , if two teams finish with the same total score , the match is considered a draw even if the teams kick a different number of goals ( e.g. 12.10 ( 82 ) drew 11.16 ( 82 ) ) .
