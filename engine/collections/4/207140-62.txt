Pimon ( voiced by Billy West ) and Tumbaa ( voiced by Kevin Michael Richardson ) are a buff meerkat and warthog duo who are evil counterparts of Timon and Pumbaa . They are shown to be bullies of the jungle , as they enjoy pushing Timon and Pumbaa around , giving them atomic wedgies , as well as being shown picking on a squirrel . They also have their own philosophy : Kahuna Potato , which means that they will never leave Timon and Pumbaa ( or anyone ) alone .
