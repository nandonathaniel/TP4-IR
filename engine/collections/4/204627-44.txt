The expansion project calls for a new stadium to be built alongside the historical Auteuil 's greenhouses and expansion of old stadiums and the tournament village . In May 2015 , the city council voted against the expansion project , but on 9 June 2015 Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo announced the signing of the construction permits , with work scheduled to begin in September of that year and concluding in 2019 . In December 2015 , the Paris Administrative Court once again halted renovation work . The French Tennis Federation is appealing the decision . Opponents , however , vow to continue to fight the expansion plans in the courts .
