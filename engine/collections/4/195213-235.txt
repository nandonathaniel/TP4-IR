In the Rhineland and Netherlands the Carolingian form of west end known as the westwerk prevailed . Towers and apse of the western end are often incorporated into a multi-storey structure that bears little structural or visual relationship to the building behind it . These westwerks take a great variety of forms as may be seen at Maria Laach Abbey , St Gertrude , Nivelles , and St Serviatius , Maastricht .
