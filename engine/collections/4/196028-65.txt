For a star with at least 0.5 M , when the hydrogen supply in its core is exhausted and it expands to become a red giant , it can start to fuse helium atoms to form carbon . The energy output of the helium fusion process per unit mass is only about a tenth the energy output of the hydrogen process , and the luminosity of the star increases . This results in a much shorter length of time in this stage compared to the main sequence lifetime . ( For example , the Sun is predicted to spend 130 million years burning helium , compared to about 12 billion years burning hydrogen . ) Thus , about 90 % of the observed stars above 0.5 M will be on the main sequence . On average , main - sequence stars are known to follow an empirical mass - luminosity relationship . The luminosity ( L ) of the star is roughly proportional to the total mass ( M ) as the following power law :
