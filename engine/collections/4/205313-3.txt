The Air Force 1 ( or AF1 or AF - 1 ) was originally called simply the Air Force . The name is a reference to Air Force One , the plane that carries the President of the United States . The shoes are sold in three different styles , low , mid and high . The mid comes with a connected strap . The high - top Air Force 1s come with a velcro - securable strap ; the mid-top strap is secured to the shoe while the high - top 's strap is movable and removable on some versions . Although the shoe comes in different colors and color schemes , the most common Air Force 1s sold are solid white ( also referred to as `` white on white '' ) , the second most common being solid black ( `` black on black '' ) .
