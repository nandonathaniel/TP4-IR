The barrier was always a short distance inside East German territory to avoid any intrusion into Western territory . The actual borderline was marked by posts and signs and was overlooked by numerous watchtowers set behind the barrier . The strip of land on the West German side of the barrier -- between the actual borderline and the barrier -- was readily accessible but only at considerable personal risk , because it was patrolled by both East and West German border guards .
