The government began heavy military spending in 1940 , and started drafting millions of young men that year . By 1945 , 17 million had entered service to their country , but that was not enough to absorb all the unemployed . During the war , the government subsidized wages through cost - plus contracts . Government contractors were paid in full for their costs , plus a certain percentage profit margin . That meant the more wages a person was paid the higher the company profits since the government would cover them plus a percentage .
