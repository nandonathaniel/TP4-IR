Sheriff Rosco P. Coltrane ( James Best ) ( 1979 -- 1985 , 1997 , 2000 ) is the bumbling and corrupt sheriff of Hazzard County and right - hand man and brother - in - law of its corrupt county administrator , Jefferson Davis `` J.D. '' Hogg ( `` Boss Hogg '' ) , whom Rosco calls his `` little fat buddy '' , `` Little Chrome Dome '' , `` Little Meadow - Muffin '' , and several other names . In the early episodes , it is mentioned that Rosco spent the first 20 years of his career as a mostly honest lawman , but after the county voted away his pension Rosco joined Hogg in an effort to fund his retirement in his last couple of years as sheriff . Early episodes also portray him as a fairly hard - nosed , somewhat darker policeman character , who even shoots a criminal during the first season . As the series progressed and producers recognized how popular it had become with children , James Best altered his portrayal into a more bumbling , comical character . By the end of the first season , his origin had been virtually forgotten ( and his job as sheriff appeared to become open ended ) . Rosco is also the younger brother of Lulu Coltrane Hogg ( Boss Hogg 's wife ) . Rosco frequently initiates car chases with Bo and Luke Duke , but the Duke boys usually elude Rosco by outwitting him , with Rosco typically wrecking his patrol car as a result from which he would nearly always escape unscathed . ( Only two episodes -- the fourth season 's `` Coltrane vs. Duke '' and season six 's `` Too Many Roscos '' -- toy with the concept of him being injured . The first episode has him faking injury so the Duke Boys would lose the General Lee while the latter has James Best playing two characters . His normal character , Rosco , is presumed drowned while a criminal that looks like Rosco has a headache . ) These chases are often the result of Rosco setting up illegal speed traps such as false or changing speed limit signs and various other trickery , which would evolve into being increasingly more cartoonish and far - fetched as the seasons passed . While he enjoys `` hot pursuit '' he seemingly ( Boss Hogg as well ) never intends for anyone to get seriously hurt . His middle initial , ' P ' , was added at the start of the second season , and only one episode ( the third season 's `` Mrs. Rosco P. Coltrane '' , in which he is subjected to a scam marriage ) reveals his middle name , `` Purvis '' . Rosco also has a soft spot for his basset hound Flash , introduced at the start of the third season . His radio codename is `` Red Dog '' . When James Best briefly boycotted the show during the mid-second season , he was temporarily replaced by several `` one - off '' Sheriffs , the longest standing being Sheriff Grady Bird , played by Dick Sargent , who appeared in two episodes ( `` Jude Emery '' and `` Officer Daisy Duke '' ) .
