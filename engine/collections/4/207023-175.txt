Blacks in Mississippi had been disfranchised by statutory and constitutional changes since the late 19th century . In 1963 COFO held a Freedom Vote in Mississippi to demonstrate the desire of black Mississippians to vote . More than 80,000 people registered and voted in the mock election , which pitted an integrated slate of candidates from the `` Freedom Party '' against the official state Democratic Party candidates .
