During the High Middle Ages tales originating from Brythonic traditions entered English folklore -- the Arthurian myth . These were derived from Anglo - Norman , Welsh and French sources , featuring King Arthur , Camelot , Excalibur , Merlin and the Knights of the Round Table such as Lancelot . These stories are most centrally brought together within Geoffrey of Monmouth 's Historia Regum Britanniae ( History of the Kings of Britain ) . Another early figure from British tradition , King Cole , may have been based on a real figure from Sub-Roman Britain . Many of the tales and pseudo-histories make up part of the wider Matter of Britain , a collection of shared British folklore .
