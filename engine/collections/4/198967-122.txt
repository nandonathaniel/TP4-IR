The third BIOS virus was a technique called `` Persistent BIOS infection . '' It appeared in 2009 at the CanSecWest Security Conference in Vancouver , and at the SyScan Security Conference in Singapore . Researchers Anibal Sacco and Alfredo Ortega , from Core Security Technologies , demonstrated how to insert malicious code into the decompression routines in the BIOS , allowing for nearly full control of the PC at start - up , even before the operating system is booted . The proof - of - concept does not exploit a flaw in the BIOS implementation , but only involves the normal BIOS flashing procedures . Thus , it requires physical access to the machine , or for the user to be root . Despite these requirements , Ortega underlined the profound implications of his and Sacco 's discovery : `` We can patch a driver to drop a fully working rootkit . We even have a little code that can remove or disable antivirus . ''
