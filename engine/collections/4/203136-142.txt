However , at that moment , Goten , Gohan , Trunks , and Majuub save him , and Mr. Satan , Chi - Chi , and Videl also show up for support . While Majuub tries to hold off the dragon , Gohan , Goten , and Trunks give all of their power to Goku . Goku absorbs more power than even he thought possible , and even though he 's still blind , he can perfectly sense the one - star dragon 's movements . The dragon ca n't even land a punch . Goku fires a Kamehameha wave at the dragon , seemingly killing him . The dragon reappears , having dodged the blast . He sucks up the other six Dragon Balls , which were scattered around the area , and he transforms into Omega Shenron .
