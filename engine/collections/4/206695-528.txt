You must be seeing something in the government source that I ca n't see . Can you indicate which bit of text you think says that the river is on the border at the Falls ? As to the sources indicated above , the first is an opinion piece and not considered reliable , and a quick search of the second revealed no mention of `` Hogenakal '' , `` Hogenakkal '' , or `` Falls '' , so I am not sure how it is relevant .
