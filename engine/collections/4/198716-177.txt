The solutions to a system of two second degree equations in two variables may be viewed as the coordinates of the points of intersection of two generic conic sections . In particular two conics may possess none , two or four possibly coincident intersection points . An efficient method of locating these solutions exploits the homogeneous matrix representation of conic sections , i.e. a 3x3 symmetric matrix which depends on six parameters .
