The written history of Los Angeles city and county began with a Colonial Mexican town that was founded by 11 Mexican families which were known as `` Los Pobladores '' that established a settlement in Southern California that changed little in the three decades after 1848 , when California became part of the United States . Much greater changes came from the completion of the Santa Fe railroad line from Chicago to Los Angeles in 1885 . `` Overlanders '' flooded in , namely white Protestants from the Lower Midwest and South . Los Angeles had a strong economic base in farming , oil , tourism , real estate and movies . It grew rapidly with many suburban areas inside and outside the city limits . Hollywood made the city world - famous , and World War II brought new industry , especially high - tech aircraft construction . Politically the city was moderately conservative , with a weak labor union sector .
