The first social networking sites , including Classmates.com ( 1995 ) and SixDegrees.com ( 1997 ) , were introduced prior to social media sites . It has been argued that the transition towards social media sites began after the world 's first online interactive diary community Open Diary was founded on December 19 , 1998 ; currently still online after ten years , it has hosted over five million digital diaries . Open Diary successfully brought online diary writers together into one community as an early social networking site , and it was during this time that the term `` weblog '' was coined ( later to be shortened to the ubiquitous `` blog '' after one blogger jokingly turned weblog into the sentence `` we blog '' ) . Some claim that this marked the beginning of the current era of social media , with `` social media '' being a term that entered into both common usage and prominence as high - speed Internet became increasingly available , growing in popularity as a concept and leading to the rise of social networking sites such as Myspace ( 2003 ) and Facebook ( 2004 ) . It has been argued that this trend towards social media `` can be seen as an evolution back to the Internet 's roots , since it re-transforms the World Wide Web to what it was initially created for : a platform to facilitate information exchange between users .
