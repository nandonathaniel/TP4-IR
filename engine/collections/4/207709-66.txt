Lightstruck , or `` skunked '' or `` skunky '' , beer has been exposed to ultraviolet and visible light . The light causes riboflavin to react with and break down isohumulones , a molecule that contributes to the bitterness of the beer and is derived from the hops . A molecule resulting from a subsequent chain of reactions , 3 - methylbut - 2 - ene - 1 - thiol , is very similar chemically and in odour to the musk - borne mercaptans that are a skunk 's natural defences .
