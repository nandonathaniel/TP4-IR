Fearing the Greeks might attack the bridges across the Hellespont and trap his army in Europe , Xerxes now retreated with much of the Persian army back to Asia , though nearly all of them died of starvation and disease on the return voyage . He left a handpicked force , under Mardonius , to complete the conquest the following year . However , under pressure from the Athenians , the Peloponnesians eventually agreed to try to force Mardonius to battle , and they marched on Attica . Mardonius retreated to Boeotia to lure the Greeks into open terrain , and the two sides eventually met near the city of Plataea . At the Battle of Plataea , the Greek army won a decisive victory , destroying much of the Persian army and ending the invasion of Greece . Meanwhile , at the near - simultaneous naval Battle of Mycale , they also destroyed much of the remaining Persian fleet , thereby reducing the threat of further invasions .
