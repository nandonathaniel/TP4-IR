Although most of a cell 's DNA is contained in the cell nucleus , the mitochondrion has its own independent genome that shows substantial similarity to bacterial genomes . Mitochondrial proteins ( proteins transcribed from mitochondrial DNA ) vary depending on the tissue and the species . In humans , 615 distinct types of protein have been identified from cardiac mitochondria , whereas in rats , 940 proteins have been reported . The mitochondrial proteome is thought to be dynamically regulated .
