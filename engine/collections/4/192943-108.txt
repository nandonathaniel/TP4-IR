The RX 400h gasoline engine switched off automatically and the car ran completely on electricity when either stationary , decelerating , or being driven at slow speeds -- less than 60 km / h ( 40 mph ) . Not only did the hybrid drive in the RX 400h improve fuel economy , but with the assistance of the electric motor , the RX 400h could reach 0 -- 100 km / h ( 0 -- 60 mph ) in 7.3 seconds , quicker than the gasoline - only RX . Despite the increased performance , the RX 400h / Harrier Hybrid consumed roughly the same amount of gasoline as a compact four - cylinder sedan and it qualified as a Super Ultra Low Emission Vehicle ( SULEV ) in the US . Passing power at lower and mid engine rpm 's was noticeably improved due to the electric motor . The water pump for the gasoline engine is driven by the camshaft belt . To improve efficiency , and because the gasoline engine shuts down during electric - only operation , the alternator , power steering pump , and air conditioner compressor are beltless ; rather than being tied to engine output , these components are powered by electric motors via the battery instead .
