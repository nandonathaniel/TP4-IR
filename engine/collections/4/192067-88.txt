In 2007 , Trent Green was traded to the Miami Dolphins leaving the door open for either Damon Huard or Brodie Croyle to become the new starting quarterback . After starting the season with a 4 -- 3 record , the Chiefs lost the remaining nine games when running back Larry Johnson suffered a season - ending foot injury and the quarterback position lacked stability with Huard and Croyle . Despite the team 's 4 -- 12 record , tight end Tony Gonzalez broke Shannon Sharpe 's NFL record for touchdowns at the position ( 63 ) and defensive end Jared Allen led the NFL in quarterback sacks with 15.5 .
