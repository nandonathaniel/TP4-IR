The review commented negatively on some of the scenes involving Nancy 's family , noting that `` the movie 's worst scenes involve Nancy and her alcoholic mother '' . On the character development , Newman stated that `` the impression that about two hundred pages worth of characterisation has been compressed into clich√© details like boozy Ronee Blakley demonstrating her renewed self - respect by throwing away a half - full bottle . '' Newman also said that the nightmares in the film worked against itself , stating that `` while the kissing telephone and bottomless bathtub are disorienting in the ( David ) Cronenberg spirit , they get in the way of the relentless , pursuing - monster aspect that Carpenter manages so well .
