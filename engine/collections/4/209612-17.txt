After the end of the American Revolutionary War , Isaac Sears , Marinus Willet , and John Lamb in New York City revived the Sons of Liberty . In March 1784 , they rallied an enormous crowd that called for the expulsion of any remaining Loyalists from the state starting May 1 . The Sons of Liberty were able to gain enough seats in the New York assembly elections of December 1784 to have passed a set of punitive laws against Loyalists . In violation of the Treaty of Paris ( 1783 ) , they called for the confiscation of the property of Loyalists . Alexander Hamilton defended the Loyalists , citing the supremacy of the treaty .
