A weekly segment in which Richard Herring would taste a different milk ( shrew , tapir , blue whale , Jesus milk , American beaver milk , the milk of human kindness ) and give a rating out of ten . Despite the name no solid food was ever featured in this piece ( although Golden Grahams also featured elsewhere on the show several times , apparently to ensure this unloved cereal did not go unnoticed in the UK ) . He would end with the line `` Remember , there 'll always be milk '' .
