At the 2017 Four Continents Championships , Hanyu placed third in the short program with a score of 97.04 points , due to popping his quadruple Salchow - triple toe loop combination to a double - triple . He finished the short program 6 points behind Nathan Chen who placed first , and around 3.5 points behind Shoma Uno , who was second . During his free skating , despite a strong start , he again popped his planned quadruple Salchow - triple toe loop combination attempt . Hanyu then improvised his layout for the second half of the program , successfully changing three of his jumping passes into more difficult elements to maximize his score after the mistake . He placed first in the free skating with a score of 206.67 , but overall finished second behind Nathan Chen by about four points .
