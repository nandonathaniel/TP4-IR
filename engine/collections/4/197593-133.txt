The world 's largest randomized controlled trial on therapy with anorexia nervosa outpatients , the ANTOP - Study , published 2013 in The Lancet , found evidence that modified psychodynamic therapy is effective in increasing body mass index after a 10 - month treatment and that the effect is persistent until at least a year after concluding the treatment . Relative to other treatments assigned , it was found to be as effective in increasing body mass index as cognitive behavioral therapy and as a standard treatment protocol ( which consisted of referral to a list of psychotherapists with experience in treating eating - disorders in addition to close monitoring and treatment by a family doctor ) . Furthermore , considering the outcome to be the recovery rate one year after the treatment , measured by the proportion of patients who no longer met the diagnostic criteria for anorexia nervosa , modified psychodynamic therapy was found to be more effective than the standard treatment protocol and as effective as cognitive behavioral therapy .
