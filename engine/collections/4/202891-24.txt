The lens usually is focused by adjusting the distance from the lens assembly to the image plane , or by moving elements of the lens assembly . To improve performance , some lenses have a cam system that adjusts the distance between the groups as the lens is focused . Manufacturers call this different things : Nikon calls it CRC ( close range correction ) ; Canon calls it a floating system ; and Hasselblad and Mamiya call it FLE ( floating lens element ) .
