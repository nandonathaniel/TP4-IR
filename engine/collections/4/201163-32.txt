The species is divided into two subspecies on the basis of size and geography . Size overlap has caused some to question the division . The smaller subspecies , the lesser snow goose ( C. c. caerulescens ) , lives from central northern Canada to the Bering Straits area . The lesser snow goose stands 64 to 79 cm ( 25 to 31 in ) tall and weighs 2.05 to 2.7 kg ( 4.5 to 6.0 lb ) . The larger subspecies , the greater snow goose ( C. c. atlanticus ) , nests in northeastern Canada . It averages about 3.2 kg ( 7.1 lb ) and 79 cm ( 31 in ) , but can weigh up to 4.5 kg ( 9.9 lb ) . The wingspan for both subspecies ranges from 135 to 165 cm ( 53 to 65 in ) . Blue - morph birds are rare among the greater snow geese and among eastern populations of the lesser .
