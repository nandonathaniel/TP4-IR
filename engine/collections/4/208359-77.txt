The interaction of the Jovian magnetosphere with Ganymede , which has an intrinsic magnetic moment , differs from its interaction with the non-magnetized moons . Ganymede 's internal magnetic field carves a cavity inside Jupiter 's magnetosphere with a diameter of approximately two Ganymede diameters , creating a mini-magnetosphere within Jupiter 's magnetosphere . Ganymede 's magnetic field diverts the co-rotating plasma flow around its magnetosphere . It also protects the moon 's equatorial regions , where the field lines are closed , from energetic particles . The latter can still freely strike Ganymede 's poles , where the field lines are open . Some of the energetic particles are trapped near the equator of Ganymede , creating mini-radiation belts . Energetic electrons entering its thin atmosphere are responsible for the observed Ganymedian polar aurorae .
