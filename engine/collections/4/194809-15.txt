As air pollution increases , symptoms of asthma worsen . Asthma 's etiology is poorly understood and currently has no cure . There are many environmental factors that attribute to asthma . The main sources of environmental pollution are the burning of fossil fuels in the combustion engines , dust generated by traffic on road surfaces , and biomass used for cooking and heating . In urban areas , there are high concentrations of particulate matter , nitrogen dioxide , ozone , and other volatile organic compounds and can make breathing more difficult . Young children who are exposed to air pollution are extremely vulnerable . One reason they are more vulnerable is because the average breathing pattern for an adult is 16 to 20 breaths per minute , while a 1 - year - old child has a faster breathing pattern which is 20 to 40 breaths per minute . Therefore , children will be inhaling more pollutants than adults .
