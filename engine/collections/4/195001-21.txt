The idea that compulsory voting results in a higher degree of political legitimacy is based on higher voter turnout . Referring back to the Australian experience , voluntary voting prior to 1924 accounted between 47 % and 78 % turnout of eligible voters . Following the introduction of compulsory federal voting in 1924 , this figure jumped to between 91 % and 96 % . with only 5 % of eligible voters accounted as not enrolled .
