Today , 93 % of South Africa 's land is still owned by ' descendants of white settlers ' despite the political negotiation of the Native Land Act in 1913 . King ( 1990 ) argued that ' space ' is a mode of segregations , creating forms of inclusions and exclusions .

Decolonization marks one of the historical moments in which African countries increased its autonomous status from the impetus Western colonial powers .

The representation of Africa , therefore , reveals the continual Western legacies of the colonial past and the struggles embedded in the countries .
