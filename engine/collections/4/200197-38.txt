The practical limit for θ ( \ displaystyle \ theta ) is about 70 ° . In a dry objective or condenser , this gives a maximum NA of 0.95 . In a high - resolution oil immersion lens , the maximum NA is typically 1.45 , when using immersion oil with a refractive index of 1.52 . Due to these limitations , the resolution limit of a light microscope using visible light is about 200 nm . Given that the shortest wavelength of visible light is violet ( λ ( \ displaystyle \ lambda ) ≈ 400 nm ) ,
