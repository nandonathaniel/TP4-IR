After the Trail Blazers dismantled their pay - per - view network BlazerVision in 2001 , the team reached a broadcast deal with FSN Northwest , where the team 's game telecasts aired until the 2006 -- 07 season . Fox Sports Networks did not renew its contract with the Blazers at the conclusion of the 2006 -- 07 season ; as a result , Comcast formed a new regional sports network , Comcast SportsNet Northwest , to assume the broadcast rights to the team . The network launched on November 1 , 2007 , coinciding with the start of the 2007 -- 08 Trail Blazers regular season .
