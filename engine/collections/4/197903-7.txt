Later - generation e-cigarettes often called mods , PVs ( personal vaporizer ) or APVs ( advanced personal vaporizer ) have an increased nicotine - dispersal performance , house higher capacity batteries , and come in various shapes such as metal tubes and boxes . They contain silver , steel , metals , ceramics , plastics , fibers , aluminum , rubber and spume , and lithium batteries . A growing subclass of vapers called cloud - chasers configure their atomizers to produce large amounts of vapor by using low - resistance heating coils . This practice is known as cloud - chasing . Many e-cigarettes are made of standardized replaceable parts that are interchangeable between brands . A wide array of component combinations exists . Many e-cigarettes are sold with a USB charger . E-cigarettes that resemble pens or USB memory sticks are also sold for those who may want to use the device unobtrusively .
