Land reform emerged as a critical issue during the Lancaster House Talks to end the Rhodesian Bush War . ZANU leader Robert Mugabe and ZAPU leader Joshua Nkomo insisted on the redistribution of land -- by compulsory seizure , without compensation -- as a precondition to a negotiated peace settlement . This was reflective of prevailing attitudes in their guerrilla armies , the Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army ( ZANLA ) and Zimbabwe People 's Revolutionary Army ( ZIPRA ) respectively , and rural support bases , which had high expectations of the redistribution of land . The British government , which mediated the talks , proposed a constitutional clause underscoring property ownership as an inalienable right to prevent a mass exodus of white farmers and the economic collapse of the country . This was enshrined in Section 16 of the Zimbabwean Constitution , 1980 . To secure Mugabe and Nkomo 's support for the constitutional agreement , Lord Carrington announced that the United Kingdom would be prepared to assist land resettlement with technical assistance and financial aid . The Secretary - General of the Commonwealth of Nations , Sir Shridath Ramphal , also received assurances from the American ambassador in London , Kingman Brewster , that the United States would likewise contribute capital for `` a substantial amount for a process of land redistribution and they would undertake to encourage the British government to give similar assurances '' .
