In season six , it was revealed that Luke felt bad for leaving Damon and Bonnie trapped on the Other Side , and started providing hallucinogenic herbs to Elena so she could communicate with Damon . Luke explained to the group about his family 's dark past and how he would eventually have to merge with his twin , Liv . He completed the merge ceremony with Kai through a loophole because he did n't want to kill Liv , nor did he want Kai to do the same to Jo and take the leadership of their coven . He went into the ceremony believing that he could win , but he ended up losing the merge ceremony and his life essence was absorbed by Kai , along with his ability to possess magic ( something Kai was not born with ) . An unintended side - effect of the merge was Kai absorbing Luke 's personality traits , such as his compassion and empathy , which have tempered his own sociopathic personality .
