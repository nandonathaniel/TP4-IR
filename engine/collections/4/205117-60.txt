As in his previous film , Ï€ , Aronofsky uses montages of extremely short shots throughout the film ( sometimes termed a hip hop montage ) . While an average 100 - minute film has 600 to 700 cuts , Requiem features more than 2,000 . Split - screen is used extensively , along with extremely tight closeups . Long tracking shots ( including those shot with an apparatus strapping a camera to an actor , called the Snorricam ) and time - lapse photography are also prominent stylistic devices .
