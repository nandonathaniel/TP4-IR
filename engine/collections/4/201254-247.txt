Some chemists treat the categories `` d - block elements '' and `` transition metals '' interchangeably , thereby including groups 3 -- 12 among the transition metals . In this instance the group 12 elements are treated as a special case of transition metal in which the d electrons are not ordinarily involved in chemical bonding . The 2007 report of mercury ( IV ) fluoride ( HgF ) , a compound in which mercury would use its d electrons for bonding , has prompted some commentators to suggest that mercury can be regarded as a transition metal . Other commentators , such as Jensen , have argued that the formation of a compound like HgF can occur only under highly abnormal conditions ; indeed , its existence is currently disputed . As such , mercury could not be regarded as a transition metal by any reasonable interpretation of the ordinary meaning of the term .
