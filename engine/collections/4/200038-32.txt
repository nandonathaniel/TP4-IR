( I was ) in the dressing room with the loose tube . Johnny ( Burnett ) was playing an E chord and I was playing in a G position but I 'd take my fingers off and play in octaves ( using the thumb and middle or index finger ) . He was n't singing ' The Train Kept A-Rollin ' ' , it was another song , and I got to doing doom diddle doom daddle doom daddle ... ( Later ) I told Owen Bradley about it at the Barn , where we cut the stuff , and he said , ' let me hear it ' . So I started doing it and he said , ' Well , let 's do it ' .
