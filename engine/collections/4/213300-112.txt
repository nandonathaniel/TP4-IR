In the United States , the term `` the 51st state '' when applied to Canada can serve to highlight the similarities and close relationship between the United States and Canada . Sometimes the term is used disparagingly , intended to deride Canada as an unimportant neighbor . In the Quebec general election , 1989 , the political party Parti 51 ran 11 candidates on a platform of Quebec seceding from Canada to join the United States ( with its leader , Andr√© Perron , claiming Quebec could not survive as an independent nation ) . The party attracted just 3,846 votes across the province , 0.11 % of the total votes cast . In comparison , the other parties in favour of sovereignty of Quebec in that election got 40.16 % ( PQ ) and 1.22 % ( NPDQ ) .
