Amancio attempted to clear up any confusion , by stating , `` I understand the issue , I understand the cause , and it is a noble one , but I do n't think it 's relevant in the case of Unity . In Unity you play this character called Arno , and when you 're playing co-op you 're also playing Arno -- everybody is . It 's like Aiden Pearce in Watch Dogs ... Arno has different skills - you select skill points in the game , there are gear elements that have an impact and all these weapons that make the character you make your own . But you 're always playing Arno ... The reason we 're just changing the face and keeping the bodies is we want people to show off the gear that they pick up in the game through exploration . That 's why we kept that . ''
