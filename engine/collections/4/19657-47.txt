The reals are uncountable ; that is : there are strictly more real numbers than natural numbers , even though both sets are infinite . In fact , the cardinality of the reals equals that of the set of subsets ( i.e. the power set ) of the natural numbers , and Cantor 's diagonal argument states that the latter set 's cardinality is strictly greater than the cardinality of N. Since the set of algebraic numbers is countable , almost all real numbers are transcendental . The non-existence of a subset of the reals with cardinality strictly between that of the integers and the reals is known as the continuum hypothesis . The continuum hypothesis can neither be proved nor be disproved ; it is independent from the axioms of set theory .
