Sally Phillips as Tilly -- An old school friend of Miranda 's and the daughter of Penny 's never - seen friend Belinda , who fits right in with their private school background , often showing more in common with Penny than Miranda does . Tilly is a socialite and normally quite self - centred , though on occasion , she does come through for her friends and shows that she is kind and generous . She will often address Miranda by her school nickname , `` Queen Kong '' ( due to Miranda 's stature and clumsiness ) , despite Miranda 's displeasure , but her criticisms and attempts to help Miranda are generally well intentioned . Tilly 's catchphrase is `` bear with '' , usually said as she breaks off conversations to read text messages . While seeming more confident and together than Miranda , she has her own problems romantically , particularly when her fianc√© , Rupert ( played by Adam James ) , makes a pass at Miranda behind her back . In the penultimate episode , she becomes engaged to her army doctor boyfriend , `` Dreamboat '' Charlie ( played by Adrian Scarborough ) . The final episode sees Miranda give Tilly tickets to Wick so she can be free of her mother and elope with Charlie .
