In the 1980s , adoptions accounted for half of the so - called `` missing girls '' . Through the 1980s , as the one - child policy came into force , parents who desired a son but had a daughter often failed to report or delayed reporting female births to the authorities . Some parents may have offered up their daughters for formal or informal adoption . A majority of children who went through formal adoption in China in the later 1980s were girls , and the proportion who were girls increased over time .
