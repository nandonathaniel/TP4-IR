Price declines in the late 1970s and early 1980s forced the closure of numerous mines . Most uranium ore in the United States comes from deposits in sandstone , which tend to be of lower grade than those of Australia and Canada . Because of the lower grade , many uranium deposits in the United States became uneconomic when the price of uranium declined sharply in the late 1970s . By 2001 , there were only three operating uranium mines ( all in - situ leaching operations ) in the United States . Annual production reached a low of 779 metric tons of uranium oxide in 2003 , but then more than doubled in three years to 1672 metric tons in 2006 , from 10 mines . The U.S. DOE 's Energy Information Administration reported that 90 % of U.S. uranium production in 2006 came from in - situ leaching .
