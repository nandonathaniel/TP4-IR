Richard Rodgers originally composed this tune ( with the title `` Beneath the Southern Cross '' ) for the NBC television series Victory at Sea ( 1952 / 1953 ) . When Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II collaborated on Me and Juliet , Rodgers took his old melody and set it to new words by Hammerstein , producing the song `` No Other Love '' . The song has a tango rhythm ( referred to by Rodgers as a `` languid tango '' in his autobiography , Musical Stages ) .
