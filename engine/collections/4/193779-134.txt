Regarding the beginning of the war , Ulysses S. Grant , who had opposed the war but served as an army lieutenant in Taylor 's Army , claims in his Personal Memoirs ( 1885 ) that the main goal of the U.S. Army 's advance from Nueces River to Rio Grande was to provoke the outbreak of war without attacking first , to debilitate any political opposition to the war .
