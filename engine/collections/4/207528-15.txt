The lens has three main parts : the lens capsule , the lens epithelium , and the lens fibers . The lens capsule forms the outermost layer of the lens and the lens fibers form the bulk of the interior of the lens . The cells of the lens epithelium , located between the lens capsule and the outermost layer of lens fibers , are found only on the anterior side of the lens . The lens itself lacks nerves , blood vessels , or connective tissue .
