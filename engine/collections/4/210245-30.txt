Entrepreneur Aaron Cloud built a 165 feet ( 50 m ) wooden observation tower at the summit of the mountain in 1838 , but it was destroyed by a storm and replaced by a much smaller tower in 1851 . Visitors to the mountain would travel to the area by rail and road , and then walk up the 1.1 - mile ( 1.8 km ) mountaintop trail to the top , where Cloud also had a restaurant and club .
