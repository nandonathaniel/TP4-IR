The Ghana empire , the earliest of the Sudanic empires , flourished in present - day eastern Mauritania from the fourth to the 13th centuries . At the peak of its power in the 11th century , its realms extended from the Atlantic Ocean to Timbuctu . After the decline of Ghana , the Mali Empire grew into a powerful Muslim state , which reached its apogee in the early part of the 14th century . The territory of the Mali Empire in Ivory Coast was limited to the north - west corner around Odienn√© .
