password patterns : Any pattern in a password makes guessing ( automated or not ) easier and reduces an attacker 's work factor . For example , passwords of the following case - insensitive form : consonant , vowel , consonant , consonant , vowel , consonant , number , number ( for example pinray45 ) are called Environ passwords . The pattern of alternating vowel and consonant characters was intended to make passwords more likely to be pronounceable and thus more memorable . Unfortunately , such patterns severely reduce the password 's information entropy , making brute force password attacks considerably more efficient . In the UK in October 2005 , employees of the British government were advised to use passwords in this form .
