The modern term of mujahideen referring to spiritual Muslim warriors , originates in the 19th century when the local people of Afghanistan fought against the invading British ( although initially the British derogatorally called them the Sitana Fanatics ) . It began in 1829 when a religious man , Sayyid Ahmed Shah Brelwi , came back to the village of Sitana from a pilgrimage to Mecca and began preaching war against the infidels in the area defining the Northwest border of British India . Although he died in battle , the sect he had created survived and the Mujahideen gained more power and prominence . During the Indian Mutiny of 1857 , the Mujahideen were said to accept any fleeing Sepoys and recruit them into their ranks . As time went by the sect grew ever larger until it was raiding and controlling larger areas in Afghanistan .
