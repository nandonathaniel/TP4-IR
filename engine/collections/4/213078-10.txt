Projectiles in smoothbore firearms are quite loose in the barrel . The last contact with the barrel gives the ball a spin around an axis at right angles to the direction of flight . The aerodynamics result in the ball veering off in a random direction from the aiming point . The practice of rifling , putting grooves in the barrel of a weapon , causing the projectile to spin on the same axis as the line of flight , prevented this veering off from the aiming point . Initially rifles were used primarily as sporting weapons and had little presence in warfare . However , by 1611 rifles were already starting to see some use in warfare by Denmark . From around 1750 , rifles began to be used by skirmishers ( Frederick the Great raised a Jäger unit in 1744 from game - keepers and foresters , armed with rifles ) , but the very slow rate of fire of muzzle - loading rifles restricted their use until the invention of the Minié ball in 1849 , ending the smoothbore musket era . Rifled muskets of the mid-19th century , like the Springfield Model 1861 , were significantly more accurate , with the ability to hit a man sized target at a distance of 500 yards ( 460 m ) or more . The advantage of this extended range was demonstrated at the Battle of Four Lakes , where Springfield Model 1855 rifled muskets inflicted heavy casualties among the Indian warriors before they could get their smooth bore muskets into range . However , in the Italian War of 1859 , French forces were able to defeat the longer range of Austrian rifle muskets by aggressive skirmishing and rapid bayonet assaults during close quarters combat .
