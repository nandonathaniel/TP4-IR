For all modern ATA host adapters , this is not true , as modern ATA host adapters support independent device timing . This allows each device on the cable to transfer data at its own best speed . Even with older adapters without independent timing , this effect applies only to the data transfer phase of a read or write operation . This is usually the shortest part of a complete read or write operation .
