The Oslo Accords of the early 1990s between the Palestine Liberation Organization and Israel led to the creation of the Palestinian Authority . This was an interim organization created to administer a limited form of Palestinian self - governance in the territories for a period of five years during which final - status negotiations would take place . The Palestinian Authority carried civil responsibility in some rural areas , as well as security responsibility in the major cities of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip . Although the five - year interim period expired in 1999 , the final status agreement has yet to be concluded despite attempts such as the 2000 Camp David Summit , the Taba summit , and the unofficial Geneva Accords .
