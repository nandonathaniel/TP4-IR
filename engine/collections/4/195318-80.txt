Dawson City was created in the early days of the Klondike gold rush , when prospector Joe Ladue and shopkeeper Arthur Harper decided to make a profit from the influx to the Klondike . The two men bought 178 acres ( 72 ha ) of the mudflats at the junction of the Klondike and Yukon rivers from the government and laid out the street plan for a new town , bringing in timber and other supplies to sell to the migrants . The Hän village of Tr'ochëk along Deer Creek was considered to be too close to the new town , and the NWMP Superintendent Charles Constantine moved its inhabitants 3 miles ( 4.8 km ) down - river to a small reserve . The town , in the beginning simply known as `` Harper and Ladue town site '' , was named Dawson City after the director of Canada 's Geographical Survey . It grew rapidly to hold 500 people by the winter of 1896 , with plots of land selling for $500 ( $400,000 ) each .
