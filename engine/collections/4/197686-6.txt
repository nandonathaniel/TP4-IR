Although the pharaoh delegated his authority , the performance of temple rituals was still an official duty , restricted to high - ranking priests . The participation of the general populace in most ceremonies was prohibited . Much of the lay religious activity in Egypt instead took place in private and community shrines , separate from the official temples . As the primary link between the human and divine realms , temples attracted considerable veneration from ordinary Egyptians .
