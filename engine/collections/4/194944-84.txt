In November 2006 , Miller stated that he intended to make Fury Road and that the film was never going to involve Gibson : `` There 's a real hope . The last thing I wanted to do is another Mad Max , but this script came along , and I 'm completely carried away with it . '' The film 's screenplay was co-written with cult British comic creator Brendan McCarthy , who also designed many of the new characters and vehicles . Miller again confirmed his intention to make another Mad Max at the 2007 Aurora filmmaker initiative . However , he stated that he thought Gibson would not be interested in the film because of his age . Heath Ledger was reportedly considered for the lead before his death in 2008 . On 5 March 2009 , it was announced that an R - rated 3D animated feature film was in pre-production and would be taking much of the plot from Fury Road , although Gibson would not be in the film and Miller was looking for a `` different route '' , a `` renaissance '' of the franchise . Miller cited director Akira Kurosawa as an inspiration for what he wanted to do with the franchise . Miller was also developing an action - adventure tie - in video game based on the fourth film , along with God of War II video game designer Cory Barlog . Both projects were expected to take two to two - and - a-half years , according to Miller , with a release date of either 2011 or 2012 . Fury Road was going to be produced at Dr. D Studios , a digital art studios founded in 2008 by Miller and Doug Mitchell .
