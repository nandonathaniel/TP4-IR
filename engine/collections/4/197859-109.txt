A greedy catgirl merchant who frequently interferes with the protagonists , Koma also provides the group with various items and equipment in her traveling store `` Caterwaul '' . She is not very loyal and very greedy , frequently using any situation to make a quick buck and willing to change sides as long as she gets paid ( as Aschen puts it , she has `` loyalty issues '' ) . She has fought against Haken and his group a few times , due to being hired as being a bodyguard , but has almost greeted them with no hard feelings in later meetings despite being beaten by them in every battle . In battle she is a competent hand - to - hand fighter who wields a sword along with her natural cat claws and also uses her tail as a striking weapon and can even spin it around to hover in midair , she can also use money as a weapon , dumping large amounts to try to crush her enemies .
