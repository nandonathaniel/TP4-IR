The geological age of the Caribbean Sea is estimated to be between 160 and 180 million years and was formed by a horizontal fracture that split the supercontinent called Pangea in the Mesozoic Era . It is assumed the proto - caribbean basin existed in the Devonian period . In the early Carboniferous movement of Gondwana to the north and its convergence with the Euramerica basin decreased in size . The next stage of the Caribbean Sea 's formation began in the Triassic . Powerful rifting led to the formation of narrow troughs , stretching from modern Newfoundland to the west coast of the Gulf of Mexico which formed siliciclastic sedimentary rocks . In the early Jurassic due to powerful marine transgression , water broke into the present area of the Gulf of Mexico creating a vast shallow pool . The emergence of deep basins in the Caribbean occurred during the Middle Jurassic rifting . The emergence of these basins marked the beginning of the Atlantic Ocean and contributed to the destruction of Pangaea at the end of the late Jurassic . During the Cretaceous the Caribbean acquired the shape close to that seen today . In the early Paleogene due to Marine regression the Caribbean became separated from the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic Ocean by the land of Cuba and Haiti . The Caribbean remained like this for most of the Cenozoic until the Holocene when rising water levels of the oceans restored communication with the Atlantic Ocean .
