On February 18 , 1939 , President Roosevelt had the opportunity to see the memorial for himself . His motorcade passed through Islamorada on the way to Key West where he was to begin a visit with the battle fleet on maneuvers . But there is no record that he made a stop ; no mention in newspaper reports , the President 's daily calendar , or in a press conference held during a lunch stop at the CCC camp on West Summerland Key ( renamed Scout Key in 2010 ) . This omission is puzzling in that he had sent a telegram to the dedication in which he expressed `` heartfelt sympathy '' and said `` the disaster which made desolate the hearts of so many of our people brought a personal sorrow to me because some years ago I knew many residents of the keys . '' The welcoming committee included Key West Mayor Willard M. Albury , and other local officials .
