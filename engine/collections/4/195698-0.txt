In statistics , a sampling distribution or finite - sample distribution is the probability distribution of a given statistic based on a random sample . Sampling distributions are important in statistics because they provide a major simplification en route to statistical inference . More specifically , they allow analytical considerations to be based on the sampling distribution of a statistic , rather than on the joint probability distribution of all the individual sample values .
