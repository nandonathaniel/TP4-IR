Each federal judge serves at a particular `` duty station '' for the duration of his or her federal service . This is important because of the relationship among several federal statutes . First , 28 U.S.C. ยง 456 ( a ) entitles federal judges to reimbursement of transportation and `` subsistence '' expenses incurred while transacting official business away from their duty stations . Section 456 also prescribes that the District of Columbia is the duty station of all members of the U.S. Supreme Court , the D.C. Circuit , the Federal Circuit , and the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia .
