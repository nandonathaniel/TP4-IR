The National Football League also has a coin toss for tie - breaking among teams for playoff berths and seeding , but the rules make the need for coin toss , which is random rather than competitive , very unlikely . A similar procedure breaks ties for the purposes of seeding in the NFL Draft ; these coin tosses are more common , since the tie - breaking procedure for the draft is much less elaborate than the one used for playoff seeding .
