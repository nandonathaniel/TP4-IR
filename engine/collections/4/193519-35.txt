The Enquirer ran another story in April 2016 , suggesting that Cruz 's father , Rafael Cruz , knew alleged JFK assassin Lee Harvey Oswald and worked with Oswald in New Orleans a few months before the assassination . Donald Trump publicly discussed this Enquirer story on May 3 , 2016 saying to Brian Kilmeade of Fox News that `` His father was with Lee Harvey Oswald prior to Oswald 's being -- you know , shot . I mean the whole thing is ridiculous '' . On May 4 , 2016 ( a few hours after Cruz lost the Indiana primary and withdrew his candidacy ) Trump stated that he did not actually believe the story ( `` Of course I do n't believe that '' ) but the Enquirer wanted to `` let the people read it . '' Kilmeade has since expressed regret for not following up on Trump 's May 3 comment during that interview . Rafael Cruz responded in an interview with WorldNetDaily that , `` These accusations are totally unfounded and without merit '' . On July 22 , 2016 , Trump again mentioned the magazine in connection with Cruz 's father , saying `` ... I know nothing about his father . I know nothing about Lee Harvey Oswald . But there was a picture on the front page of the National Enquirer that does have credibility . ''
