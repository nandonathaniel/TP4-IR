In his 1918 book , Folklore in the Old Testament , Scottish social anthropologist Sir James George Frazer documented similarities between Old Testament stories , such as the Flood , and indigenous legends around the world . He identified Livingston 's account with a tale found in Lozi mythology , wherein the wicked men build a tower of masts to pursue the Creator - God , Nyambe , who has fled to Heaven on a spider - web , but the men perish when the masts collapse . He further relates similar tales of the Ashanti that substitute a pile of porridge pestles for the masts . Frazer moreover cites such legends found among the Kongo people , as well as in Tanzania , where the men stack poles or trees in a failed attempt to reach the moon . He further cited the Karbi and Kuki people of Assam as having a similar story . The traditions of the Karen people of Myanmar , which Frazer considered to show clear ' Abrahamic ' influence , also relate that their ancestors migrated there following the abandonment of a great pagoda in the land of the Karenni 30 generations from Adam , when the languages were confused and the Karen separated from the Karenni . He notes yet another version current in the Admiralty Islands , where mankind 's languages are confused following a failed attempt to build houses reaching to heaven .
