In the Late Paleozoic , Permo - Carboniferous glaciations left extensive glacio - fluvial deposits across central India , in new basins created by sag / normal faulting . These tillites and glacially derived sediments are designated the Gondwanas series . The sediments are overlain by rocks resulting from a Permian marine transgression ( 270 Ma ( ICS 2004 ) ) .
