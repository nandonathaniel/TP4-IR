By 1827 , the school , with one faculty member , was struggling . Nathan Dane , a prominent alumnus of the college , then endowed the Dane Professorship of Law , insisting that it be given to then Supreme Court Justice Joseph Story . For a while , the school was called `` Dane Law School . '' In 1829 , John H. Ashmun , son of Eli Porter Ashmun and brother of George Ashmun , accepted a professorship and closed his Northampton Law School , with many of his students following him to Harvard . Story 's belief in the need for an elite law school based on merit and dedicated to public service helped build the school 's reputation at the time , although the contours of these beliefs have not been consistent throughout its history . Enrollment remained low through the 19th century as university legal education was considered to be of little added benefit to apprenticeships in legal practice . After first trying lowered admissions standards , in 1848 HLS eliminated admissions requirements entirely . In 1869 , HLS also eliminated examination requirements .
