Radiometric dating was used to determine the age of rock samples from Lōʻihi . The Hawaii Center for Volcanology tested samples recovered by various expeditions , notably the 1978 expedition , which provided 17 dredge samples . Most of the samples were found to be of recent origin ; the oldest dated rock is around 300,000 years old . Following the 1996 event , some young breccia was also collected . Based on the samples , scientists estimate Lōʻihi is about 400,000 years old . The rock accumulates at an average rate of 3.5 mm ( 0.14 in ) per year near the base , and 7.8 mm ( 0.31 in ) near the summit . If the data model from other volcanoes such as Kīlauea holds true for Lōʻihi , 40 % of the volcano 's mass formed within the last 100,000 years . Assuming a linear growth rate , Lōihi is 250,000 years old . However , as with all hotspot volcanoes , Lōihi 's level of activity has increased with time ; therefore , it would take at least 400,000 years for such a volcano to reach Lōihi 's mass . As Hawaiian volcanoes drift northwest at a rate of about 10 cm ( 4 in ) a year , Lōʻihi was 40 km ( 25 mi ) southeast of its current position at the time of its initial eruption .
