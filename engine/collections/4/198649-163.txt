The metastability in flip - flops can be avoided by ensuring that the data and control inputs are held valid and constant for specified periods before and after the clock pulse , called the setup time ( t ) and the hold time ( t ) respectively . These times are specified in the data sheet for the device , and are typically between a few nanoseconds and a few hundred picoseconds for modern devices . Depending upon the flip - flop 's internal organization , it is possible to build a device with a zero ( or even negative ) setup or hold time requirement but not both simultaneously .
