Since August Horch was prohibited from using `` Horch '' as a trade name in his new car business , he called a meeting with close business friends , Paul and Franz Fikentscher from Zwickau . At the apartment of Franz Fikentscher , they discussed how to come up with a new name for the company . During this meeting , Franz 's son was quietly studying Latin in a corner of the room . Several times he looked like he was on the verge of saying something but would just swallow his words and continue working , until he finally blurted out , `` Father -- audiatur et altera pars ... would n't it be a good idea to call it audi instead of horch ? '' `` Horch ! '' in German means `` Hark ! '' or `` hear '' , which is `` Audi '' in the singular imperative form of `` audire '' -- `` to listen '' -- in Latin . The idea was enthusiastically accepted by everyone attending the meeting . On 25 April 1910 the Audi Automobilwerke GmbH Zwickau ( from 1915 on Audiwerke AG Zwickau ) was entered in the company 's register of Zwickau registration court .
