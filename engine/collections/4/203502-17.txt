To investigate the epidemic , the city government and various medical practitioners formed the Strange Disease Countermeasures Committee ( 奇病 対策 委員 会 , Kibyō Taisaku Iinkai ) at the end of May 1956 . Owing to the localised nature of the disease , it was suspected to be contagious and as a precaution patients were isolated and their homes disinfected . Although contagion was later disproved , this initial response contributed to the stigmatisation and discrimination experienced by Minamata victims from the local community . During its investigations , the committee uncovered surprising anecdotal evidence of the strange behaviour of cats and other wildlife in the areas surrounding patients ' homes . From around 1950 onward , cats had been seen to have convulsions , go mad , and die . Locals called it the `` cat dancing disease '' ( 猫 踊り 病 , neko odori byō ) , owing to their erratic movement . Crows had fallen from the sky , seaweed no longer grew on the sea bed , and fish floated dead on the surface of the sea . As the extent of the outbreak was understood , the committee invited researchers from Kumamoto University to help in the research effort .
