The capability of nanoprobes to absorb improved technologies they find into the Borg collective is shown in the Voyager episode `` Drone '' , where Seven of Nine 's nanoprobes are fused with the Doctor 's mobile emitter which uses technology from the 29th century of the history line of the Federation , creating an individual 29th - century drone existing outside the collective , with capabilities far surpassing that of late 24th - century drones . The attempt by the Borg to assimilate this drone is unsuccessful , so its enhanced capabilities are not disseminated throughout the collective .
