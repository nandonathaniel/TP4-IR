In Ukraine , since 2006 cinema releases are almost always dubbed into Ukrainian with the overdubbing technique and multiple voice actors dubbing different original voices with a small percent of art - house / documentaries shown in the original language with Ukrainian subtitles . For television , TV channels usually release movies and TV - shows with a Ukrainian voiceover , although certain high - profile films and TV shows are dubbed rather than voice - overe'ed .
