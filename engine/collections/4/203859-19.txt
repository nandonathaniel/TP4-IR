Salvo Montalbano , the police commissario of Vigàta , a fictional town in the fictional province of Montelusa , Sicily , is a gruff character who is responsible and serious at work , but often also open and friendly with people he knows he can trust . Montalbano must investigate various criminal acts in his area which -- thanks to his great intelligence and the help of numerous assistants , even outside the police -- he always manages to solve by reconstructing the exact events . Among his colleagues are his Deputy , Mimì Augello , Inspector Giuseppe Fazio , the awkward policeman Agatino Catarella , Galluzzo and other officers of the police station . Otherwise , among his external collaborators are his friend Ingrid Sjostrom , the journalist Niccolò Zito and , more rarely , Adelina , his cook . In his private life , Salvo carries on a long - distance relationship with Livia Burlando , with whom he has a sometimes tempestuous relationship but within which love always prevails .
