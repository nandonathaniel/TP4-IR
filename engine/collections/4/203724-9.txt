Io 's main source of internal heat comes from the tidal forces generated by Jupiter 's gravitational pull . This external heating differs from the internal heat source for volcanism on Earth , which is a result of radioactive isotope decay and residual heat from accretion . In the Earth , these internal heat sources drive mantle convection , which in turn causes volcanism through plate tectonics .
