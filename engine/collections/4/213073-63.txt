In 1991 , Jerry Ordway was given the Shazam ! assignment , which he pitched as a painted graphic novel that would lead into a series , rather than starting the series outright . Ordway both wrote and illustrated the graphic novel , titled The Power of Shazam ! , which was released in 1994 . Power of Shazam ! retconned Captain Marvel again and gave him a revised origin , rendering Shazam ! The New Beginning and the Action Comics Weekly story apocryphal while Marvel 's appearances in Legends and Justice League still counted as part of the continuity .
