On 26 April 1936 , Badoglio began the `` March of the Iron Will '' from Dessie to Addis Ababa , an advance with a mechanised column against slight Ethiopian resistance . Meanwhile , Selassie conducted a disorganized retreat towards the capital . There , government officials operated without leadership , unable to contact the Emperor and unsure of his whereabouts . Realizing that Addis Ababa would soon fall to the Italians , Ethiopian administrators met to discuss a possible evacuation of the government to the west . After several days , they decided that they should relocate to Gore , though actual preparations for their departure were postponed . Addis Ababa became crowded with retreating soldiers from the front while its foreign residents sought refuge at various European legations .
