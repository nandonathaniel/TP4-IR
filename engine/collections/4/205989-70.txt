While the series does not have many lead characters , there are many recurring characters . Jeffrey Dean Morgan portrays John Winchester , father of Sam and Dean . Making an appearance in the pilot episode , John does not return until nearly halfway through the first season , after which he becomes a recurring character until his eventual death in the second season 's premiere episode , though his spirit returns to help his sons in the season finale . Later in the series , it is announced that John Winchester fathered a third son with another woman ; a half - brother to Sam and Dean . According to writer John Shiban , it was decided early on that John would die . The writers found that having the brothers being separated from their father `` split the show '' . Shiban noted that `` ... the boys were looking for Dad , and they were looking for a monster of the week , whatever that is , whatever case crosses their path . It became difficult , because we thought it was like -- ' what is Dad doing ? Is he doing more interesting things than the boys are doing , or what ? ' '' They believed Morgan was initially reluctant about returning to Supernatural for the second season because of his recurring role on the series Grey 's Anatomy . Future appearances of the character have been hindered by Morgan 's busy schedule .
