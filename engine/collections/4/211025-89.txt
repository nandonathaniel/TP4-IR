Also in 1830 , Richard Roberts patented the first self - acting mule . The Stalybridge mule spinners strike was in 1824 , this stimulated research into the problem of applying power to the winding stroke of the mule . The draw while spinning had been assisted by power , but the push of the wind had been done manually by the spinner , the mule could be operated by semiskilled labour . Before 1830 , the spinner would operate a partially powered mule with a maximum of 400 spindles after , self - acting mules with up to 1,300 spindles could be built .
