Specific to emergency medicine , incoming patients in immediate danger of life or limb , whether presenting via ambulance or walk - in triage , are paged locally within the emergency department as `` Resus '' ( ri : s…ôs ) codes . These codes indicate the type of emergency ( general medical , trauma , cardiopulmonary or neurological ) and type of patient ( adult or pediatric ) . An estimated time of arrival may be included , or `` now '' if the patient is already in the department . The patient is transported to the nearest open trauma bay or evaluation room , and is immediately attended by a designated team of physicians and nurses for purposes of immediate stabilization and treatment .
