In mathematics , the logarithm is the inverse operation to exponentiation , just as division is the inverse of multiplication and vice versa . That means the logarithm of a number is the exponent to which another fixed number , the base , must be raised to produce that number . In the most simple case the logarithm counts repeated multiplication of the same factor ; e.g. , since 1000 = 10 × 10 × 10 = 10 , the `` logarithm to base 10 '' of 1000 is 3 . More generally , exponentiation allows any positive real number to be raised to any real power , always producing a positive result , so the logarithm can be calculated for any two positive real numbers b and x where b is not equal to 1 . The logarithm of x to base b , denoted log ( x ) ( or log x when no confusion is possible ) , is the unique real number y such that b = x . For example , log 64 = 6 , as 64 = 2 .
