Over the next several months , the ship was upgraded with the most advanced weaponry available . Among the new weapon systems installed were four MK 141 quad cell launchers for 16 AGM - 84 Harpoon anti-ship missiles , eight Armored Box Launcher ( ABL ) mounts for 32 BGM - 109 Tomahawk missiles , and a quartet of the United States Navy 's Phalanx Close in Weapon System ( CIWS ) 20mm Gatling guns for defense against enemy anti-ship missiles and enemy aircraft . Wisconsin also received eight RQ - 2 Pioneer Unmanned Aerial Vehicles , which are remotely controlled drones that replaced the helicopters previously used to spot for her nine 16 in ( 410 mm ) guns . Also included in her modernization were upgrades to radar and fire control systems for her guns and missiles , and improved electronic warfare capabilities . Armed as such , Wisconsin was formally recommissioned on 22 October 1988 in Pascagoula , Mississippi under the command of Captain Jerry M. Blesch , USN . Assigned to the United States Atlantic Fleet , she was subsequently homeported at Naval Station Norfolk , Virginia , where she became the centerpiece of her own surface action group ( SAG ) , also referred to as a battleship battle group ( BBBG ) .
