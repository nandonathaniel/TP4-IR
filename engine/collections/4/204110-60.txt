Ownership changed hands several times during the franchise 's stay in Washington and was often plagued by poor decision - making and planning . Owner Elwood Richard Quesada once wondered why he should have to pay his players because he believed they did n't belong in the majors . He later agreed to a 10 - year lease at D.C. Stadium -- a move that would come back to haunt the Senators . In 1963 , Quesada sold his stake in the club and resigned . Washington stockbrokers James Johnston and James Lemon owned the team briefly , suffering massive financial losses . Johnston died in 1967 and Lemon sold the team a year later to hotel and trucking executive Bob Short , who outbid a group headed by Bob Hope . Short named himself general manager and hired Hall of Famer Ted Williams as manager . Although Williams had never coached or managed at any level of baseball , he seemed to light a spark under the once - moribund Senators . Williams kept them in contention for most of the season ; their 86 -- 76 record in 1969 would be their only winning season in Washington .
