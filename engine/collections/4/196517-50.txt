Immediate reception was overwhelmingly positive . Douglas Wolfe from TV Fanatic gave the episode 5 ( out of 5 ) and stated that `` This story was amazing and filled with sadness . I can not imagine a more compelling episode . The writing , the dialogue , the incredible performances all combined to a bring heartbreaking masterpiece to the small screen . I ca n't wait to see the second part of this story . '' Steve Marsi , also from TV Fanatic , called the episode `` powerful and unexpected '' and said in a round table , `` Ziva screaming ' Abba ' and bawling was enough to give anyone the chills , as was Gibbs standing stone - faced and ignoring the SecNav 's calls . These scenes are enhanced by the fact that we 're so invested in these characters after 10 seasons ... Superb TV entertainment , but also emblematic of the uncertain times we live in . '' Eric Hochberger added , `` Sometimes , I wish they would n't do this . Jackie in particular felt unnecessary to kill off . However , as Steve said , there 's no denying the collective brilliance of the cast and writers last night and in similar episodes . So , I guess we have to trust them and see where they take this next week and beyond . ''
