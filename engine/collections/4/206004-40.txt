The Gideons International continues to contact youth in America through The Life Book , coordinating with churches and their youth to distribute copies of the Bible in high schools . The Alliance Defending Freedom , as of 2013 , maintains that there are `` constitutionally permissible ways in which Gideons Bibles may be distributed , '' and attorneys Rory Gray and Jeremy Tedesco write that the Alliance Defending Freedom sent letters to 174 school districts in Kentucky stating : `` Federal caselaw overwhelmingly supports the decision to grant religious and non-religious community groups an equal opportunity to provide literature to willing students . '' In early 2014 , the `` Gideons International again distributed Bibles at a public elementary school in Kentucky . ''
