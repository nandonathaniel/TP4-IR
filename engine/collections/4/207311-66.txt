On January 13 , 2014 , an update to Android 4.4 `` KitKat '' was first made available through Samsung Kies in Poland for LTE models . The update adds user interface tweaks such as a camera shortcut on the corner of the lock screen , options for setting default launcher and text messaging applications , support for printing , and a new location settings menu for tracking and controlling the use of location tracking by apps . 4.4 also makes significant changes to the handling of secondary storage on the device for security reasons ; applications ' access to the SD card is now restricted to designated , app - specific directories only , while full access to internal primary storage is still allowed . Although this behavior has existed by default since Android 3.0 `` Honeycomb '' , OEMs such as Samsung previously modified their distributions of Android to retain the previous behavior , allowing applications to have unlimited access to SD card contents .
