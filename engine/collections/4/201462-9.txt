Many of the studies regarding the media 's influence on anti-social behaviour have been deemed inconclusive . Violence , racism , sexism , and other anti-social acts are attributed to things such as genetic predisposition and violence in the home . Some reviews have found strong correlations between aggression and the viewing of violent media , while others find little evidence to support their case . The only unanimously accepted truth regarding anti-social behaviour is that parental guidance carries an undoubtedly strong influence ; providing children with brief negative evaluations of violent characters helps to reduce violent effects in the individual .
