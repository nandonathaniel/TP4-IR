The diet of the Eurasian badger consists largely of earthworms ( especially Lumbricus terrestris ) , insects , grubs , and the eggs and young of ground - nesting birds . They also eat small mammals , amphibians , reptiles and birds , as well as roots and fruit . In Britain , they are the main predator of hedgehogs , which have demonstrably lower populations in areas where badgers are numerous , so that hedgehog rescue societies do not release hedgehogs into known badger territories . They are occasional predators of domestic chickens , and are able to break into enclosures that a fox can not . In southern Spain , badgers feed to a significant degree on rabbits .
