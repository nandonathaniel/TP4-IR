IRNSS is an independent regional navigation satellite system being developed by India . It is designed to provide accurate position information service to users in India as well as the region extending up to 1500 km from its boundary , which is its primary service area . IRNSS will provide two types of services , namely , Standard Positioning Service ( SPS ) and Restricted Service ( RS ) and is expected to provide a position accuracy of better than 20 m in the primary service area . It is an autonomous regional satellite navigation system being developed by Indian Space Research Organisation , which is under total control of Indian government . The requirement of such a navigation system is driven by the fact that access to Global Navigation Satellite Systems like GPS is not guaranteed in hostile situations . ISRO initially planned to launch the constellation of satellites between 2012 and 2014 but the project got delayed by nearly 2 years .
