The Chesapeake Bay separates the contiguous portion of the Commonwealth from the two - county peninsula of Virginia 's Eastern Shore . The bay was formed following a meteoroid impact crater during the Eocene . Many of Virginia 's rivers flow into the Chesapeake Bay , including the Potomac , Rappahannock , James , and York , which create three peninsulas in the bay .
