Jane the Virgin premiered on The CW on October 13 , 2014 , during the 2014 -- 15 television season . Unique to the CW , it is the network 's only program to feature a Spanish language audio track on the second audio program channel ; however , as many CW stations usually do not carry the SAP channel due to a lack of need , this is more limited than the major networks , which are required by the FCC to have a SAP channel for the Descriptive Video Service track , which as a minor network the CW is not required to carry .
