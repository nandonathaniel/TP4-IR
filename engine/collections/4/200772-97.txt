In order to identify the next Supreme , Zoe , Madison , Misty and Queenie undergo the test of the Seven Wonders . The Seven Wonders are seven acts of magic so advanced , each pushes the boundaries of witchcraft . The one who performs them all successfully is the next Supreme . At first , the girls pass each test of magic with ease , until they reach the test of descensum , where they must send their spirits to hell and return before sunrise . All pass the test except Misty whose spirit remains trapped in her own personal hell . When the sun rises , her body turns to dust . They recommence the tests with completing the act of transmutation ( teleportation ) . This leads Zoe to her own demise when she teleports herself through the iron gates of the Academy , impaling and ultimately killing herself . Queenie tries , but ca n't resurrect Zoe . Madison has the power to perform the resurrection , but refuses . By process of elimination , she believes she is the new Supreme . Fearing Madison as Supreme will be no different from Fiona , Myrtle convinces Cordelia to join the competition . Cordelia completes all the tests successfully while Madison fails at divination . Cordelia brings back Zoe and is crowned Supreme . Myrtle later requests to again be burned alive for her dishonorable actions of murder . Kyle kills Madison for refusing to resurrect Zoe , and Spalding takes her body . Cordelia makes peace with her dying mother after inheriting her powers and title of Supreme . Fiona then joins the Axeman in her personal hell where , as he informs her , they will spend the rest of eternity . At the end , Cordelia comes out to the public on television , informing people of the witches ' Coven . Along with new Council members Zoe and Queenie , and the new house butler Kyle , she offers hope to young witches everywhere .
