In an April 2007 blog post for TV Guide , actress Kate Flannery , who plays Meredith Palmer , called Jim 's impression of Dwight `` one of the funniest scenes that I have ever witnessed . '' She recalled that Krasinski and Wilson enjoyed filming the scene , and that the whole cast was laughing during it , necessitating many takes . The scene was first intended for the season 's twenty - second episode , `` Women 's Appreciation '' , before it was moved to `` Product Recall '' due to time constraints .
