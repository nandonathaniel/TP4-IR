R - 401A is a HCFC zeotropic blend of R - 22 , R - 152a , and R - 124 . It is designed as a replacement for R - 12 . R - 404A is a HFC `` nearly azeotropic '' blend of 52 wt. % R - 143a , 44 wt. % R - 125 , and 4 wt. % R - 134a . It is designed as a replacement of R - 22 and R - 502 CFC . Its boiling point at normal pressure is - 46.5 ° C , its liquid density is 0.485 g / cm . R - 406A is a zeotropic blend of 55 wt. % R - 22 , 4 wt. % R - 600a , and 41 wt. % R - 142b . R - 407A is a HFC zeotropic blend of 20 wt. % R - 32 , 40 wt. % R - 125 , and 40 wt. % R - 134a . R - 407C is a zeotropic hydrofluorocarbon blend of R - 32 , R - 125 , and R - 134a . The R - 32 serves to provide the heat capacity , R - 125 decreases flammability , R - 134a reduces pressure . R - 408A is a zeotropic HCFC blend of R - 22 , R - 125 , and R - 143a . It is a substitute for R - 502 . Its boiling point is - 44.4 ° C . R - 409A is a zeotropic HCFC blend of R - 22 , R - 124 , and R - 142b . Its boiling point is - 35.3 ° C. Its critical temperature is 109.4 ° C . R - 410A is a near - azeotropic blend of R - 32 and R - 125 . The US Environmental Protection Agency recognizes it as an acceptable substitute for R - 22 in household and light commercial air conditioning systems . It appears to have gained widespread market acceptance under several trade names . R - 438A another HFC blended replacement for R - 22 , with five components : R - 32 , R - 125 / R - 134a , R - 600 , and R - 601a , blended in respective ratios 8.5 +. 5 , - 1.5 % ; 45 ± 1.5 % ; 44.2 ± 1.5 % ; 1.7 +. 1 , -. 2 % ; 0.6 +. 1 , -. 2 % . The mean molecular weight of this mix is 99 , resulting in the tradename ISCEON MO99 from manufacturer DuPont ( a line of blended HFC products developed initially by Rhodia , and sold to DuPont ) . R - 500 is an azeotropic blend of 73.8 wt. % R - 12 and 26.2 wt. % of R - 152a . R - 502 is an azeotropic blend of R - 22 and R - 115 .
