Most large denominations experienced a North -- South split in the prewar era on the issue of slavery . The creation of a new country necessitated independent structures . For example , the Presbyterian Church in the United States split , with much of the new leadership provided by Joseph Ruggles Wilson ( father of President Woodrow Wilson ) . In 1861 , he organized the meeting that formed General Assembly of the Southern Presbyterian Church and served as its chief executive for thirty - seven years . Baptists and Methodists together formed majorities of both the white and the slave population ( see Black church ) . Both broke off from their Northern coreligionists over the slavery issue . Elites in the southeast favored the Protestant Episcopal Church in the Confederate States of America , which reluctantly split off the Episcopal Church ( USA ) in 1861 . Other elites were Presbyterians belonging to the 1861 founded Presbyterian Church in the United States . Catholics included an Irish working class element in coastal cities and an old French element in southern Louisiana . Other insignificant and scattered religious populations included Lutherans , the Holiness movement , other Reformed , other Christian fundamentalists , the Stone - Campbell Restoration Movement , the Churches of Christ , the Latter - day Saints movement , Adventists , Muslims , Jews , Native American animists , deists and irreligious people .
