Real Time with Bill Maher is a talk show that airs weekly on HBO , hosted by comedian and political satirist Bill Maher . Much like his previous series Politically Incorrect on Comedy Central and later ABC , Real Time features a panel of guests who discuss current events in politics and the media . Unlike the previous show , guests are usually more well - versed in the subject matter : more experts such as journalists , professors and politicians participate in the panel , and fewer actors and celebrities are included . Additionally , many guests appear via satellite .
