The number of joints in the human body depends on age and definition . For example , before puberty the hip bone still consist of three bones ( i.e. ilium , pubis , ischium ) . The mandible ( i.e. jawbone ) , on the other hand , consists of two bones fused together in a symphysis , a connection between two bones not regarded as a joint . An adult has over 200 bones , and about 300 joints where movements can occur ( but , for example , in the sacroiliac joint movements only occurs in pregnant women ) . -- Fama Clamosa ( talk ) 11 : 04 , 13 July 2010 ( UTC )
