The 2008 video game Grand Theft Auto IV features a parody of the statue called the Statue of Happiness , which holds a coffee cup instead of a torch . The coffee cup is the tribute to the infamous Hot Coffee mod in San Andreas . Additionally , the statue 's face is modelled to look like Hillary Clinton , and its ' otherwise hollow chest contains a massive beating heart suspended by chains . The Statue of Happiness also appears in Grand Theft Auto : Chinatown Wars , however , it is downsized in order to be more visible in the game 's top - down angle . While the structure retains the star fort base , the pedestal was removed and the statue is smaller .
