Verse 16 : And the number of the army of the horsemen were two hundred thousand thousand : and I heard the number of them . two hundred thousand thousand horsemen = motorcycle gang - members Manson is attempting to recruit into the Family , in advance of Helter Skelter The motorcyclists , whose attention Manson began cultivating when the Family moved to the Yellow Submarine , were to be the Family 's `` needed military wing '' . They and the Family would cruise through Helter Skelter in the manner of a flock of birds , all turning in one direction or another without even a sound from their leader . If the cyclists were to be worthy of surviving Helter Skelter alongside the Family , it was , of course , necessary they attain the Family 's level of hippie enlightenment . Toward this end , Manson unleashed his girls as seductresses , to wean the gang members from predisposition to marriage as well as materialism and concern with time of day ( the latter horrors jointly embodied in the wearing of wristwatches ) ; with a passing exception or two , the cyclists remained bourgeois .
