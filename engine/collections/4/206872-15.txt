Ball approved original production concepts ( such as The Untouchables and Star Trek ) for development into broadcast series . She assessed proposed projects based on how the public would enjoy the production and their potential for long - term acceptance and enjoyment . This led to a profitable revenue stream from the programs through reruns , which would recover the studio 's high development and production costs . As a result , even decades after the absorption of Desilu Productions and the production end of all of the original television series Desilu approved for development , certain series have achieved enduring success and , in some cases , redevelopment into feature - length motion picture franchises in their own right . Star Trek , Mission Impossible , and The Untouchables are examples .
