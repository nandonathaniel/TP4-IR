In modern mapping , a topographic map is a type of map characterized by large - scale detail and quantitative representation of relief , usually using contour lines , but historically using a variety of methods . Traditional definitions require a topographic map to show both natural and man - made features . A topographic map is typically published as a map series , made up of two or more map sheets that combine to form the whole map . A contour line is a line connecting places of equal elevation .
