The Ritz Carlton , Westin Peachtree Plaza , Georgia - Pacific Building , SunTrust Plaza ( where more than 60 people had to be relocated out of their offices ) , Equitable Building , and Georgia State University also had windows blown out ( 300 at Equitable alone ) , as did The Tabernacle ( a former church with stained glass that is now a concert venue ) . The windows of the Westin continued to fall for days after the tornado , forcing police to keep several city blocks and MARTA 's Peachtree Center station closed to pedestrians . The Georgia World Congress Center also sustained flooding while hosting a JROTC event and the Hinman Dental Meeting ; Fox Sports Net took footage of a staircase in the new section of the complex that looked like a fountain with water cascading down it . The annual Atlanta Home Show and all other events were cancelled for the weekend in the GWCC complex , as was the Atlanta St. Patrick 's Day Parade scheduled for the next day . WRAS FM at Georgia State University was off the air for two days , though it was not stated whether its studio or tower sustained damage , or if this were due to security or safety concerns , or power outages . The historic Rialto Theatre at GSU also sustained roof damage , which in turn caused water damage inside .
