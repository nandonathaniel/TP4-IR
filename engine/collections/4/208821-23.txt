In Revelação : a verdadeira Garota de Ipanema ( `` Revealed : The Real Girl from Ipanema '' ) Moraes wrote that she was `` the paradigm of the young Carioca : a golden teenage girl , a mixture of flower and mermaid , full of light and grace , the sight of whom is also sad , in that she carries with her , on her route to the sea , the feeling of youth that fades , of the beauty that is not ours alone -- it is a gift of life in its beautiful and melancholic constant ebb and flow .
