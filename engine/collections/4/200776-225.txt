In languages ( such as C and Java ) that favor iterative looping constructs , there is usually significant time and space cost associated with recursive programs , due to the overhead required to manage the stack and the relative slowness of function calls ; in functional languages , a function call ( particularly a tail call ) is typically a very fast operation , and the difference is usually less noticeable .
