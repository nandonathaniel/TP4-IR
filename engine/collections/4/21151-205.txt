In October 2009 , Apple released a minor upgrade for the Apple TV called `` Apple TV Software 3.0 '' . This update replaced the interface in version 2.0 with a new interface which presented seven horizontal columns across the top of the screen for the different categories of content ( Movies , TV Shows , Music , Podcasts , Photos , Internet , and Settings ) . This update also added features such as content filtering , iTunes Extras , new fonts , and a new Internet radio app . The maximum resolution increased in both the 40 GB and 160 GB version to include 1080P .
