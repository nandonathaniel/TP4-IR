The list includes planets within the range of 0.8 -- 1.9 Earth masses , below which are generally classed as sub-Earth and above classed as super-Earth . In addition , only planets known to fall within the range of 0.5 -- 2.0 Earth radius ( between half and twice the radius of the Earth ) are included . In contrast , the Earth Similarity Index uses both mass and radius as criteria .
