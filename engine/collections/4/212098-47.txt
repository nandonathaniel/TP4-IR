The `` joint technical commissions '' required by the pact were established by an agreement of 20 December 1940 . They were to consist of a general commission in each capital , consisting of the host foreign minister and the other two partners ' ambassadors . Under the general commission were to be military and economic commissions . On 15 December 1941 the first meeting of all three commissions in one capital , Berlin , took place , labelled a `` Tripartite Pact Conference '' . It was decided there to form a `` Permanent Council of the Tripartite Pact Powers '' , but nothing happened for two months . Only the Italians , whom the Japanese mistrusted , pushed for greater collaboration .
