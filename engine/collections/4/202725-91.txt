In the Early Christian Church , the presumption that the Septuagint was translated by Jews before the era of Christ , and that the Septuagint at certain places gives itself more to a christological interpretation than 2nd - century Hebrew texts was taken as evidence that `` Jews '' had changed the Hebrew text in a way that made them less christological . For example , Irenaeus concerning Isaiah 7 : 14 : The Septuagint clearly writes of a virgin ( Greek παρθένος , bethulah in Hebrew ) that shall conceive. , while the word almah in the Hebrew text was , according to Irenaeus , at that time interpreted by Theodotion and Aquila ( both proselytes of the Jewish faith ) as a young woman that shall conceive . According to Irenaeus , the Ebionites used this to claim that Joseph was the ( biological ) father of Jesus . From Irenaeus ' point of view that was pure heresy , facilitated by ( late ) anti-Christian alterations of the scripture in Hebrew , as evident by the older , pre-Christian , Septuagint .
