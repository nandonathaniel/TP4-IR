De Lesseps wanted a sea - level canal as at Suez but only visited the site a few times , during the dry season which lasts only four months of the year . His men were totally unprepared for the rainy season , during which the Chagres River , where the canal started , became a raging torrent , rising up to 35 feet ( 10 m ) . The dense jungle was alive with venomous snakes , insects and spiders , but the worst aspect was the yellow fever and malaria ( and other tropical diseases ) which killed thousands of workers : by 1884 the death rate was over 200 per month . Public health measures were ineffective because the role of the mosquito as a disease vector was then unknown . Conditions were downplayed in France to avoid recruitment problems , but the high mortality rate made it difficult to maintain an experienced workforce .
