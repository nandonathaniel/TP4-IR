While the traditional love - story structure begins when the romantic leads first encounter each other , How I Met Your Mother does not introduce Ted 's wife ( Cristin Milioti ) until the eighth - season finale , and only announces her name ( Tracy McConnell ) during the series finale . The show instead focuses on Ted 's prior relationships and his dissatisfaction with those women , thus setting the stage for his eventual happiness with Tracy .
