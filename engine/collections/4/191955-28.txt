Despite such hostility between the brownshirts and the regular army , Blomberg and others in the military saw the SA as a source of raw recruits for an enlarged and revitalised army . Röhm , however , wanted to eliminate the generalship of the Prussian aristocracy altogether , using the SA to become the core of a new German military . Limited by the Treaty of Versailles to one hundred thousand soldiers , army leaders watched anxiously as membership in the SA surpassed three million men by the beginning of 1934 . In January 1934 , Röhm presented Blomberg with a memorandum demanding that the SA replace the regular army as the nation 's ground forces , and that the Reichswehr become a training adjunct to the SA .
