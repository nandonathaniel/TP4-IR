The 1993 children 's book The Three Little Wolves and the Big Bad Pig inverts the cast and makes a few changes to the plot : the wolves build a brick house , then a concrete house , then a steel house , and finally a house of flowers . The pig is unable to blow the houses down , destroying them by other means , but eventually gives up his wicked ways when he smells the scent of the flower house , and becomes friends with the wolves .
