This site , halfway between Giza and Abu Sir , is the location for two unfinished Old Kingdom pyramids . The northern structure 's owner is believed to be pharaoh Nebka , while the southern structure , known as the Layer Pyramid , may be attributable to the Third Dynasty pharaoh Khaba , a close successor of Sekhemkhet . If this attribution is correct , Khaba 's short reign could explain the seemingly unfinished state of this step pyramid . Today it stands around 17 m ( 56 ft ) high ; had it been completed , it is likely to have exceeded 40 m ( 130 ft ) .
