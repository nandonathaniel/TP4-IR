Joffrey sets aside his earlier betrothal to Sansa Stark in favor of Margaery Tyrell , cementing an alliance between the Lannisters and House Tyrell . At Tyrion and Sansa 's wedding , he humiliates his uncle and is outraged when his uncle threatens him after he commands him to consummate their marriage . Tyrion only avoids punishment when his father Tywin assures Joffrey that his uncle was drunk and had no intention of threatening the king . Later after the events of the `` Red Wedding '' , Joffrey gleefully plans on serving Sansa her recently deceased brother 's head , when Tyrion and Tywin are outraged . Tyrion threatens Joffrey once again , and later Joffrey turns on Tywin , who responds by commanding Joffrey to be sent to his room , much to Joffrey 's chagrin . During his wedding feast in the throne room , he presents an extremely offensive play of `` The War of the Five Kings , '' with each of the kings played by dwarves , to humiliate his uncle . He also repeatedly torments Tyrion and Sansa , forcing the former to be his cupbearer . At the conclusion of the dinner , however , Joffrey 's wine is poisoned , and he dies in an event known as `` The Purple Wedding , '' in which Tyrion is falsely accused and arrested by Cersei in A Storm of Swords ( 2000 ) . It is later revealed that Lady Olenna Tyrell and Lord Petyr Baelish were the true perpetrators , with assistance from royal fool Ser Dontos Hollard , who successfully smuggles Tyrion 's wife Sansa out of King 's Landing before either of them can be caught and tried for Joffrey 's murder .
