When the battle of Verdun began on 21 February 1916 , air superiority initially enabled the Germans to establish a blockade ( luftsperre ) on the French air squadrons . However the French were already arming their specialist fighter squadrons , the Escadrilles de chasse , with the Nieuport 11 , and with a new offensive strategy they quickly overcame the luftsperre , establishing air superiority over the battle by April .
