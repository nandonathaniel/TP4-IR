As each sign is linked to a month of the solar year , it is thereby also linked to a season . Each of the elements is also linked to a season ( see above ) , and the element that shares a season with a sign is known as that sign 's fixed element . In other words , that element is believed to impart some of its characteristics to the sign concerned . The fixed element of each sign applies also to the year and hour signs , and not just the monthly sign . It is important to note that the fixed element is separate from the cycle of elements which interact with the signs in the 60 - year cycle .
