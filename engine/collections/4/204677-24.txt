Many walkers take about eight weeks to complete the path , often dividing this into sections walked over several years . In contrast , a team of six Royal Marines , taking turns in pairs to run two - hour sections , completed the path in six days in 2004 and in 2012 a runner ran the entire path in 16 days , 9 hours and 57 minutes . New records for completing the path were set on 11 May 2013 , when two runners completed the trail in 14 days , 14 hours and 45 minutes and 23 April 2015 , when a runner completed the trail in 14 days , 8 hours and 2 minutes . This record was however quickly broken by Mark Berry , who ran it in 11 days , 8 hours and 15 minutes . On 24 May 2016 outdoor journalist and GB ultra runner Damian Hall set a new fastest known time of 10 days , 15 hours and 18 minutes .
