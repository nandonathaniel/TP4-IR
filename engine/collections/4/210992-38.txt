Porsche 's Composite Ceramic Brakes ( PCCB ) are siliconized carbon fiber , with very high temperature capability , a 50 % weight reduction over iron discs ( therefore reducing the unsprung weight of the vehicle ) , a significant reduction in dust generation , substantially increased maintenance intervals , and enhanced durability in corrosive environments over conventional iron discs . Found on some of their more expensive models , it is also an optional brake for all street Porsches at added expense . It is generally recognized by the bright yellow paintwork on the aluminum six - piston calipers that are matched with the discs . The discs are internally vented much like cast - iron ones , and cross-drilled .
