Fish and chips take - away is popular . The first fish and chips were sold in Dublin in the 1880s by an Italian immigrant from San Donato Val di Comino , Giuseppe Cervi . His wife Palma would ask customers `` Uno di questa , uno di quella ? '' This phrase ( meaning ' one of this , one of the other ' ) entered the vernacular in Dublin as `` one and one '' , which is still a common way of referring to fish and chips in the city .
