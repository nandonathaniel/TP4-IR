Blanc was a regular on the NBC Red Network show The Jack Benny Program in various roles , including voicing Benny 's Maxwell automobile ( in desperate need of a tune - up ) , violin teacher Professor LeBlanc , Polly the Parrot , Benny 's pet polar bear Carmichael , the tormented department store clerk , and the train announcer . The first role came from a mishap when the recording of the automobile 's sounds failed to play on cue , prompting Blanc to take the microphone and improvise the sounds himself . The audience reacted so positively that Benny decided to dispense with the recording altogether and have Blanc continue in that role . One of Blanc 's most memorable characters from Benny 's radio ( and later TV ) programs was `` Sy , the Little Mexican '' , who spoke one word at a time . The famous `` SÃ­ ... Sy ... Sue ... sew '' routine was so effective that no matter how many times it was performed , the laughter was always there , thanks to the comedic timing of Blanc and Benny . Blanc continued to work with him on radio until the series ended in 1955 and followed the program into television from Benny 's 1950 debut episode through guest spots on NBC specials in the 1970s . They last appeared together on a Johnny Carson Tonight Show in January 1974 . A few months later , Blanc spoke highly of Benny on a Tom Snyder Tomorrow show special aired the night of the comedian 's death .
