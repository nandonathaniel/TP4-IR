Even though he was not credited for the final film , it was Baker who had the idea that the character Addie was only to be heard , and not seen . In October 1946 , F. Hugh Herbert was assigned to write the screen adaptation . His final participation was not confirmed . In the same month , it was announced that Samuel G. Engel took over as producer from Joseph L. Mankiewicz . Even before a script was finished , Gene Tierney , Linda Darnell , Maureen O'Hara , Dorothy McGuire , and Alice Faye were cast in A Letter to Five Wives in November 1946 .
