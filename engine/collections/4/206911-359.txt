The Council of the Indies was constituted in 1524 and the first Audiencia in 1527 . In 1535 , Charles V the Holy Roman Emperor ( who was as the King of Spain known as Charles I ) , named the Spanish nobleman Don Antonio de Mendoza the first Viceroy of New Spain . Mendoza was entirely loyal to the Spanish crown , unlike the conqueror of Mexico Hernán Cortés , who had demonstrated that he was independent - minded and defied official orders when he threw off the authority of Governor Velázquez in Cuba . The name `` New Spain '' had been suggested by Cortés and was later confirmed officially by Mendoza .
