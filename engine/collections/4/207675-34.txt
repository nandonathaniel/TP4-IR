On October 31 , 2007 , Panettiere joined with The Whaleman Foundation to try to disrupt the annual dolphin hunt in Taiji , Wakayama , Japan . She was involved in a confrontation between Japanese fishermen and five other surfers of the group from Australia and the United States ( including former Home and Away star Isabel Lucas ) . The confrontation lasted more than 10 minutes before the surfers were forced to return to the beach , after which they left the country . Parts of the confrontation can be seen on the award - winning Sundance Film Festival documentary film The Cove . The fishermen consider the condemnation as an attack on their culture .
