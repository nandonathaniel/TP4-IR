To gain some geometric insights and clarification , we will start with a population of three values , x , x , x . This defines a point P = ( x , x , x ) in R. Consider the line L = ( ( r , r , r ) : r âˆˆ R ) . This is the `` main diagonal '' going through the origin . If our three given values were all equal , then the standard deviation would be zero and P would lie on L. So it is not unreasonable to assume that the standard deviation is related to the distance of P to L. That is indeed the case . To move orthogonally from L to the point P , one begins at the point :
