He soon entered the Debating Society of the school . These years mark the beginning of his interest in a possible reformation of society . At first approaching the subject through Plato 's Republic , he soon turned to contemporary ideas of socialism as expressed by the recently formed Fabian Society and free lectures delivered at Kelmscott House , the home of William Morris . He was also among the founders of The Science School Journal , a school magazine that allowed him to express his views on literature and society , as well as trying his hand at fiction ; a precursor to his novel The Time Machine was published in the journal under the title The Chronic Argonauts . The school year 1886 -- 87 was the last year of his studies .
