In 2002 's Spider - Man , Peter started off with a red hood - like mask , blue stretchy pants , and a red sweater with a giant black spider on it with a black webbing background for his wrestling costume , however , after Uncle Ben 's death and he decides to become a superhero , he creates a costume based on the one worn in the comics , which in the film , are based on sketches Peter makes . The actual sketches were made by comics artist Phil Jimenez , and in the closeups of Peter 's hands as he sketches the drawings are actually those of Jimenez . The suit is made from spandex with raised silver webbing and is mostly similar to the comic version except for the front and the back spider emblems and the shape of the eye lenses .
