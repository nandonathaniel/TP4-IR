Another point of view is that it was only after the end of Japanese rule with World War II that Korea saw true , democratic rise in public education as evidenced by the rise of adult literacy rate from 22 percent in 1945 to 87.6 percent by 1970 and 93 % by the late 1980s . Though free public education was made available for elementary schools during Japanese rule , Korea as a country did not experience secondary - school enrollment rates comparable to those of Japan prior to the end of World War II .
