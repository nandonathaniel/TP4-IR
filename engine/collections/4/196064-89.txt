The show uses four major writers to devise story ideas according to `` strict guidelines '' , such as that the boys ' schemes never appear to be `` magical . '' Stories are reviewed at weekly sessions on a Monday , then simultaneously scripted and storyboarded . A very rough design is built before the storyboard , featuring little more than suggested scenes and dialogue , is drafted ; the writers then gather for a `` play - by - play '' walkthrough of the storyboard in front of the whole crew , whose reactions to the jokes are assessed before rewrites are made . The writers as well include running gags in every episode , which are generally lines spoken by characters . Almost every episode is set into two eleven - minute segments .
