The attack on Kennedy Road informal settlement by an armed mob in 2009 in Durban put local government under sustained scrutiny . It was reported by members of the Abahlali baseMjondolo movement that the attackers were affiliated with the local branch of the African National Congress and associated with the municipal councillor for the ward . It was claimed that the attack was carefully planned and sanctioned by the police department . Academic research seems to confirm that the attackers self - identified as ANC members and that ANC leaders at Municipal and Provincial level later provided public sanction for the attack . Following the attack AbM and the KRDC ( democratically elected structures ) were removed from the settlement and the provincial government replaced these structures with an unelected ANC affiliated Community Policing Forum . The attacks and forced removal of AbM from the settlement garnered national and international condemnation .
