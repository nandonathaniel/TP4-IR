The Federal Bureau of Investigation suspected that a particular location in the Gramercy Park neighborhood of Manhattan homed a gambling operation , and asked the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York to order the New York Telephone Company to install a pen register . On March 19 , 1976 District Court Judge Charles Henry Tenney did , finding probable cause of illegal gambling , authorized the installation of the pen register for up to twenty days , and ordered the telephone company to provide the necessary technical assistance required to install the pen register . The telephone company moved to vacate that order , arguing that a more specific wiretap order was required under Title III of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 . On April 2 Judge Tenney denied the motion , and the company assisted in the installation of the pen register , but appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit .
