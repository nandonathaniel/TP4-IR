In her opening monologue , host Louise Lasser , who had been arrested on a drug charge the week before and was very difficult for the cast and writers to work with that week , pretends to have a bout of stage fright and lock herself in her dressing room . She had actually done the same thing in real life just before the beginning of the show ; the cast was dividing her parts among themselves . Her self - indulgent behavior led Michaels to keep this episode out of syndication . Actor Michael Sarrazin makes a filmed cameo appearance . Preservation Hall Jazz Band performed the song `` Panama '' .
