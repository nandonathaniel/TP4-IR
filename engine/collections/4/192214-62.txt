There was a significant human cost attached to this period of economic growth , as American industry had the highest rate of accidents in the world . In 1889 , railroads employed 704,000 men , of whom 20,000 were injured and 1,972 were killed on the job . The U.S. was also the only industrial power to have no workman 's compensation program in place to support injured workers .
