Levallois Sporting Club , the amateur club where Drogba began his career , used their percentage of his transfer fees including £ 600,000 out of the £ 24 million paid when he joined Chelsea -- first to ensure the club 's survival , and then to improve their stadium to incorporate modern sports facilities for the benefit of the local community . They renamed the new stadium Stade Didier Drogba in his honour .
