The Caodong was the other school to survive into the Song period . Its main protagonist was Hung - chih Cheng - chueh , a contemporary of Dahui Zonggao . It put emphasis on `` silent illumination '' , or `` just sitting '' . This approach was attacked by Dahui as being mere passivity , and lacking emphasis on gaining insight into one 's true nature . Cheng - chueh in his turn criticized the emphasis on koan study .
