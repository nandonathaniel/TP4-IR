In modern societies , occupation is usually thought of as the main determinant of status , but other memberships or affiliations ( such as ethnic group , religion , gender , voluntary associations , fandom , hobby ) can have an influence . Achieved status is when people are placed in the stratification structure based on their individual merits or achievements . This status can be achieved through education , occupation , and marital status . Their place within the stratification structure is determined by society 's bar , which often judges them on success , success being financial , academic , political and so on . America most commonly uses this form of status with jobs . The higher you are in rank the better off you are and the more control you have over your co-workers .
