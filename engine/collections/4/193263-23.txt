Olympus Mons and a few other volcanoes in the Tharsis region stand high enough to reach above the frequent Martian dust - storms recorded by telescopic observers as early as the 19th century . The astronomer Patrick Moore pointed out that Schiaparelli ( 1835 -- 1910 ) `` had found that his Nodus Gordis and Olympic Snow ( Nix Olympica ) were almost the only features to be seen '' during dust storms , and `` guessed correctly that they must be high '' .
