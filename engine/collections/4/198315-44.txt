qPCR allows the quantification and detection of a specific DNA sequence in real time since it measures concentration while the synthesis process is taking place . There are two methods for simultaneous detection and quantification . The first method consists of using fluorescent dyes that are retained nonspecifically in between the double strands . The second method involves probes that code for specific sequences and are fluorescently labeled . Detection of DNA using these methods can only be seen after the hybridization of probes with its complementary DNA takes place . An interesting technique combination is real - time PCR and reverse transcription ( RT - qPCR ) . This sophisticated technique allows for the quantification of a small quantity of RNA . Through this combined technique , mRNA is converted to cDNA , which is further quantified using qPCR . This technique lowers the possibility of error at the end point of PCR , increasing chances for detection of genes associated with genetic diseases such as cancer . Laboratories use RT - qPCR for the purpose of sensitively measuring gene regulation .
