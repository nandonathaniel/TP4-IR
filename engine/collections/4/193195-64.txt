A dilemma arises from trying to meet important planning objectives when using the grid : pedestrianism , cost efficiency and environmental responsiveness . To serve pedestrians well , a rectangular configuration and high frequency of streets and intersections is the preferred route , which the orthogonal grid geometry provides . To reduce development costs and environmental impact , lower frequency of streets is the logical path . Since these two design objectives are contradictory a balance needs to be struck . Such balance has been achieved in leading modern projects such as Vauban , Freiburg and Village Homes , Davis . Both score high in pedestrian and bike mode share and , at the same time , in reducing negative development externalities . Their layout configurations represent a fusion of the classic grid plan with recent street network patterns .
