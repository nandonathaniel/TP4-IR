Pintail Duck was a 16th - century Duck relative and the first early ancestor to appear in person . Pintail served in the English Navy as the boatswain aboard the HMS Falcon Rover . The Falcon Rover raided Spanish targets in the Caribbean Sea between 1563 and 1564 when the ship was sunk . Pintail was friends with the ship 's first mate , Malcolm McDuck , who was also an ancestor of Donald . Pintail appears in the story `` Back to Long Ago '' ( 1956 ) in which it is suggested that he was an earlier incarnation of Donald .
