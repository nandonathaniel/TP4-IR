As the First World War continued , Gandhi also became involved in recruiting men for the British Army , an involvement which his followers had a difficult time accepting , after listening to his passionate speeches about resisting injustice in a non-violent manner . Not surprisingly , at this point , although Gandhi still remained loyal to Britain and enamored with the ideals of the British constitution , his desire to support and independent home rule became stronger . As time passed , Gandhi became exhausted from his long journey around the country and fell ill with dysentery . He refused conventional treatment and chose to practice his own healing methods , relying on diet and spending a long time bedridden , while in recovery in his ashram .
