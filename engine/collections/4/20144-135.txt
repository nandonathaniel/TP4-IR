`` Rarely have the enemy attacks been so cleverly executed and made with such reckless determination . These attacks were generally by single or few aircraft making their approaches with radical changes in course and altitude , dispersing when intercepted and using cloud cover to every advantage . They tailed our friendlies home , used decoy planes , and came in at any altitude or on the water . ''
