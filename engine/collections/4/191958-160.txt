Two adapted versions of its official badge are used by the Supreme Court . One features the words `` The Supreme Court '' and the letter omega in black ( in the official badge granted by the College of Arms , the interior of the Latin and Greek letters are gold and white , respectively ) , and displays a simplified version of the crown ( also in black ) and larger , stylised versions of the floral emblems ; this modified version of the badge is featured on the new Supreme Court website , as well as in the forms that will be used by the Supreme Court . A further variant omits the crown entirely and is featured prominently throughout the building .
