Techniques used to suppress the ethnic identity of Kurds in Syria include various bans on the use of the Kurdish language , refusal to register children with Kurdish names , the replacement of Kurdish place names with new names in Arabic , the prohibition of businesses that do not have Arabic names , the prohibition of Kurdish private schools , and the prohibition of books and other materials written in Kurdish . Having been denied the right to Syrian nationality , around 300,000 Kurds have been deprived of any social rights , in violation of international law . As a consequence , these Kurds are in effect trapped within Syria . In March 2011 , in part to avoid further demonstrations and unrest from spreading across Syria , the Syrian government promised to tackle the issue and grant Syrian citizenship to approximately 300,000 Kurds who had been previously denied the right .
