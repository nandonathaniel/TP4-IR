The early success and achievement of women at Oberlin College persuaded many early women 's rights leaders that coeducation would soon be accepted throughout the country . However , for quite a while , women sometimes suffered uncivil behavior from their male classmates . The prejudice of some male professors proved more unsettling . Many professors had disapproved of the admission of women into their classes , citing studies that stated that women were physically incapable of higher education , and some professors found it difficult to acknowledge women 's presence once they were admitted . Even today , some books , studies , and other arguments claim that women and men learn very differently from each other because of their brain differences . One of these books is Boys and Girls Learn Differently ! by Michael Gurian .
