There are critical periods in infancy and childhood during which development of certain perceptual , sensorimotor , social and language systems depends crucially on environmental stimulation . Feral children such as Genie , deprived of adequate stimulation , fail to acquire important skills and are unable to learn in later childhood . The concept of critical periods is also well - established in neurophysiology , from the work of Hubel and Wiesel among others .
