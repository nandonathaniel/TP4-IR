In the period extending roughly from 50 to 150 AD , a number of documents began to circulate among the churches , including epistles , gospel accounts , memoirs , prophecies , homilies , and collections of teachings . While some of these documents were apostolic in origin , others drew upon the tradition the apostles and ministers of the word had utilized in their individual missions , and still others represented a summation of the teaching entrusted to a particular church center . Several of these writings sought to extend , interpret , and apply apostolic teaching to meet the needs of Christians in a given locality .
