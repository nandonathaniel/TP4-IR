The other feature was a new cooling arrangement ( aft positioned , single ducted water and oil radiators assembly ) that reduced the cooling drag . Later they discovered that , after much development , the cooling assembly could take advantage of the `` Meredith effect '' , in which heated air exited the radiator with a slight amount of jet thrust . Because NAA lacked a suitable wind tunnel to test this feature , it used the GALCIT 10 ft ( 3.0 m ) wind tunnel at the California Institute of Technology . This led to some controversy over whether the Mustang 's cooling system aerodynamics were developed by NAA 's engineer Edgar Schmued or by Curtiss , although NAA had purchased the complete set of P - 40 and XP - 46 wind tunnel data and flight test reports for US $56,000 . The NA - 73X was also one of the first aircraft to have a fuselage lofted mathematically using conic sections ; this resulted in smooth , low drag surfaces . To aid production , the airframe was divided into five main sections -- forward , center , rear fuselage , and two wing halves -- all of which were fitted with wiring and piping before being joined .
