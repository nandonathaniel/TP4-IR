Cecil Rhodes ( 1853 -- 1902 ) believed that public - spirited leadership could be nurtured by identifying young people with `` moral force of character and instincts to lead '' , and educating them in contexts ( such as the collegiate environment of the University of Oxford ) which further developed such characteristics . International networks of such leaders could help to promote international understanding and help `` render war impossible '' . This vision of leadership underlay the creation of the Rhodes Scholarships , which have helped to shape notions of leadership since their creation in 1903 .
