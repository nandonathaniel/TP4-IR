The Atlantic Charter was a pivotal policy statement issued during World War II on 14 August 1941 , which defined the Allied goals for the postwar world . The leaders of the United Kingdom and the United States drafted the work and all the Allies of World War II later confirmed it . The Charter stated the ideal goals of the war -- no territorial aggrandizement ; no territorial changes made against the wishes of the people , self - determination ; restoration of self - government to those deprived of it ; reduction of trade restrictions ; global cooperation to secure better economic and social conditions for all ; freedom from fear and want ; freedom of the seas ; and abandonment of the use of force , as well as disarmament of aggressor nations . Adherents of the Atlantic Charter signed the Declaration by United Nations on 1 January 1942 , which became the basis for the modern United Nations .
