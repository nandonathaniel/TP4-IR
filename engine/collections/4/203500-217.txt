Another important property of aluminium alloys is sensitivity to heat . Workshop procedures are complicated by the fact that aluminium , unlike steel , melts without first glowing red . Manual blow torch operations require additional skill and experience . Aluminium alloys , like all structural alloys , are subject to internal stresses after heat operations such as welding and casting . The lower melting point s of aluminium alloys make them more susceptible to distortions from thermally induced stress relief . Stress can be relieved and controlled during manufacturing by heat - treating the parts in an oven , followed by gradual cooling -- in effect annealing the stresses .
