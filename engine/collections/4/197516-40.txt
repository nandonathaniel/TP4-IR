Many people regard visible tan lines as un-aesthetic , and seek to avoid tan lines that will be visible when regular clothes are worn . Some people try to achieve an all - over tan or to maximize their tan coverage . To achieve an all - over tan , tanners need to minimize the amount of clothing they wear while tanning . For women who can not dispense with a swimsuit , they at times tan with the back strap undone while lying on the front , or removing shoulder straps , besides wearing swimsuits which cover less area than their normal clothing . Any exposure is subject to local community standards and personal choice . Some people tan in the privacy of their backyard where they can at times tan without clothes , and some countries have set aside clothing - optional swimming areas ( popularly known as nude beaches ) , where people can tan and swim clothes - free . Some people tan topless , and others wear very brief swimwear , such as a microkini or thong .
