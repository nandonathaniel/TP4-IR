Thérèse was buried on 4 October 1897 , in the Carmelite plot , in the municipal cemetery at Lisieux , where her parents had been buried . Her body was exhumed in September 1910 and the remains placed in a lead coffin and transferred to another tomb . In March 1923 , however , before she was beatified , her body was returned to the Carmel of Lisieux , where it remains . The figure of Thérèse in the glass coffin is not her actual body but a gisant statue based on drawings and photos by Céline after Thérèse 's death . It contains her ribcage and other remnants of her body .
