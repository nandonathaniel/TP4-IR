Except for any move of the knight and castling , pieces can not jump over other pieces . A piece is captured ( or taken ) when an attacking enemy piece replaces it on its square ( en passant is the only exception ) . The captured piece is thereby permanently removed from the game . The king can be put in check but can not be captured ( see below ) .
