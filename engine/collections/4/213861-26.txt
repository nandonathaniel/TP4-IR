In June 1954 , UE opened a new campus , then known as UE Tech , on a 4.86 - hectare lot along Samson Road in Caloocan . UE Caloocan , which is now academically autonomous , is headed by a chancellor . The new Tan Yan Kee Academic Building houses the colleges of Arts and Sciences , Business Administration , and Fine Arts , whereas the College of Engineering has its own building . The UE Caloocan grounds have been used for ROTC and CAT instruction since 1986 .
