In October 2014 , Marvel announced a two - part sequel to Avengers : Age of Ultron , titled Avengers : Infinity War . Part 1 was scheduled to be released on May 4 , 2018 , with Part 2 scheduled for May 3 , 2019 . In April 2015 , Marvel announced that Anthony and Joe Russo would direct both parts of Avengers : Infinity War , with back - to - back filming expected to begin in 2016 . The same month , Kevin Feige said that the Infinity War films would be two distinct films `` because they ( have ) such shared elements , it felt appropriate ... to ( subtitle the films ) like that . But I would n't call it one story that 's cut in half . I would say it 's going to be two distinct movies . '' By May 2015 , Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely had signed on to write the screenplays for both parts of the film , which draws inspiration from Jim Starlin 's 1991 `` The Infinity Gauntlet '' comic and Jonathan Hickman 's 2013 `` Infinity '' comic . Anthony Russo added the film was inspired by 1990s heist films , with Thanos `` on a smash - and - grab ( to acquire the Infinity Stones ) , and everybody 's trying to catch up the whole movie '' . In May 2016 , the Russos revealed that they would retitle the two films , to further remove the misconception that they were one large film split in two , with Joe stating , `` The intention is we will change ( the titles ) , we just have n't come up with ( them ) yet . '' That July , Marvel revealed the film 's title would be shortened to simply Avengers : Infinity War .
