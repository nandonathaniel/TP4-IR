The erotic / historical drama Caligula , directed by Tinto Brass , about the infamous Roman Emperor was in part financed by Penthouse founder Bob Guccione . The film , featuring a prestigious cast ( Malcolm McDowell , Helen Mirren , Peter O'Toole , and John Gielgud ) is notable for its explicit scenes of sex and violence , including six minutes of hardcore porn footage filmed by Guccione and another editor . Caligula earned some prerelease controversy after Gore Vidal , who had written the script , distanced himself from the film . When Caligula was released , it received strongly hostile reviews , reviewers criticizing its extreme scenes of sex and violence and lack of narrative coherence . Rex Reed of New York Magazine called the film `` a trough of rotten swill '' . Roger Ebert gave Caligula a zero stars rating , dubbing it `` sickening , utterly worthless , shameful trash '' , accusing it of being artistically vulgar in its depiction of sex and violence , and of having technically incompetent direction and structure . Caligula was one of the few films Ebert ever walked out on ( two hours into its 170 - minute running time ) , after describing himself as feeling `` disgusted and unspeakably depressed '' , and he also placed it on his `` Most Hated '' list . Jay Scott , reviewing Caligula for The Globe and Mail , stated , `` Caligula does n't really work on any level '' and the film and its production `` constitute a boondoggle of landmark proportions '' . So negative was its initial reception , Australian newspaper The Age stated that Caligula was being `` billed by critics everywhere as one of the worst films ever made '' . Leslie Halliwell dubbed it `` a vile curiosity of interest chiefly to sadomasochists '' . The Hamilton Spectator later referred to Caligula as `` possibly the worst movie ever made '' . Joe Holleman , in an article in the St. Louis Post-Dispatch discussing historical films set in Ancient Rome , argued , `` two of the worst movies made in the 20th century were ancient Rome pieces ... Cleopatra and Caligula '' . Christopher Armstead , reviewing Caligula for the website Film Critics United , stated , `` Dollar for dollar , this could very well be the worst movie ever made . ''
