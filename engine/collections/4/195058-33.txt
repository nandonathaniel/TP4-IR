The sidebar graphic was dropped as a result of the network 's switch to a 16 : 9 letterbox format on September 17 , 2012 , ending the enhanced HD format altogether . The enhanced ticker and headlines , which were previously seen in the old sidebar graphic , were moved to the lower - third of the screen . Both the SD and HD feeds now use the same exact 16 : 9 letterbox format , just like its other 21st Century Fox - owned sister networks .
