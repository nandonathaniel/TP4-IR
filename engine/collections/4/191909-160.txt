The United States Census Bureau is presently finalizing the ethnic classification of MENA populations . In 2012 , prompted in part by post-9 / 11 discrimination , the American - Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee petitioned the Department of Commerce 's Minority Business Development Agency to designate the MENA populations as a minority / disadvantaged community . Following consultations with MENA organizations , the US Census Bureau announced in 2014 that it would establish a new MENA ethnic category for populations from the Middle East , North Africa and the Arab world , separate from the `` white '' classification that these populations had previously sought in 1909 . The expert groups , including some Jewish organizations , felt that the earlier `` white '' designation no longer accurately represents MENA identity , so they successfully lobbied for a distinct categorization . This process does not currently include ethnoreligious groups such as Jews or Sikhs , as the Bureau only tabulates these groups as followers of religions rather than members of ethnic groups .
