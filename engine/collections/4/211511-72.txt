Unix had a drastically simplified file model compared to many contemporary operating systems : treating all kinds of files as simple byte arrays . The file system hierarchy contained machine services and devices ( such as printers , terminals , or disk drives ) , providing a uniform interface , but at the expense of occasionally requiring additional mechanisms such as ioctl and mode flags to access features of the hardware that did not fit the simple `` stream of bytes '' model . The Plan 9 operating system pushed this model even further and eliminated the need for additional mechanisms .
