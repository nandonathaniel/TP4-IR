In 1757 the Assembly allowed bounties for the recruitment of 200 extra provincial soldiers , to be sent to South Carolina . After the fall of Fort William Henry , the Assembly also authorized the Deputy Governor to raise 1,000 soldiers , or draw them from the frontier garrisons , for the impending operations against the French in the Lake Champlain area . If the garrisons were used , their place should be filled by locally recruited garrison and ranger companies . In 1758 the Assembly approved the raising of 700 soldiers , soon raised to 1,000 , of which 700 would be serving with the British forces operating against the French , and 300 be kept in the province . A provincial frigate was also commissioned for the defense of the Delaware Bay . Encouraged by the new prime minister , William Pitt , the Assembly resolved to put 2,700 men under British command for the Forbes Expedition of 1758 , including the 1,000 provincial soldiers already serving .
