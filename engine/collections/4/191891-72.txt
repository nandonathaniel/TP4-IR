The two major motoring organisations at the time , The Automobile Association and the R.A.C. welcomed the maximum speed limits for all - purpose roads , but the R.A.C. would have preferred more flexibility for motorways . The Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents suggested that a lower speed limit would be more appropriate for all - purpose roads and the Pedestrian 's Association for Road Safety condemned the new limits as being too high , preferring 60 mph ( 97 km / h ) limits for all roads . Castle 's decision and acceptance of the RRL research at face value was controversial . Peter Walker 's motion in Parliament to annul the speed limit on motorways was negatived .
