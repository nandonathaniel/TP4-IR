The Indians who inhabit the hill country also claim that Herakles was one of them . Like the Greeks , they characterize him with the club and the lion 's skin . According to them , Herakles was a powerful man who subjugated evil beasts . He had several sons and one daughter , who became rulers in different parts of his dominion . He founded several cities , the greatest of which was Palibothra ( Pataliputra ) . Herakles built several places in this city , fortified it with water - filled trenches and settled a number of people in the city . His descendants ruled India for several generations , but never launched an expedition beyond India . After several years , the royal rule was replaced by democratic city states , although there existed a few kings when Alexander invaded India .
