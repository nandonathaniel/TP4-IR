With the release of Windows 7 , Microsoft decided not to bundle Photo Gallery within the operating system . Instead , Windows 7 came bundled with a software called Windows Photo Viewer , which has the editing capabilities of Windows Photo Gallery removed . The full suite of Photo Gallery was released as part of the Windows Live Essentials software suite instead , and as such , the application was also renamed as `` Windows Live Photo Gallery '' . The first version of Windows Live Photo Gallery beta was released on June 27 , 2007 , and the final version released on November 6 , 2007 .
