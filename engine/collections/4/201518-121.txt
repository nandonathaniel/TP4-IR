In the early morning in Hangzhou , along the wide avenue of the Imperial Way , special breakfast items and delicacies were sold . This included fried tripe , pieces of mutton or goose , soups of various kinds , hot pancakes , steamed pancakes , and iced cakes . Noodle shops were also popular , and remained open all day and night along the Imperial Way . According to one Song source on Kaifeng , the night markets closed at the third night watch but reopened on the fifth , while they had also gained a reputation for staying open during winter storms and the darkest , rainiest days of winter .
