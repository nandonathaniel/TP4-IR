Dumas wrote that the idea of revenge in The Count of Monte Cristo came from a story in a book compiled by Jacques Peuchet , a French police archivist , published in 1838 after the death of the author . Dumas included this essay in one of the editions from 1846 . Peuchet told of a shoemaker , Pierre Picaud , living in Nîmes in 1807 , who was engaged to marry a rich woman when three jealous friends falsely accused him of being a spy for England . Picaud was placed under a form of house arrest in the Fenestrelle Fort , where he served as a servant to a rich Italian cleric . When the man died , he left his fortune to Picaud , whom he had begun to treat as a son . Picaud then spent years plotting his revenge on the three men who were responsible for his misfortune . He stabbed the first with a dagger on which were printed the words `` Number One '' , and then he poisoned the second . The third man 's son he lured into crime and his daughter into prostitution , finally stabbing the man himself . This third man , named Loupian , had married Picaud 's fiancée while Picaud was under arrest .
