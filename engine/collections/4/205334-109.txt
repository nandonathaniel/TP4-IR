Because the advancing blade has higher airspeed than the retreating blade and generates a dissymmetry of lift , rotor blades are designed to `` flap '' -- lift and twist in such a way that the advancing blade flaps up and develops a smaller angle of attack . Conversely , the retreating blade flaps down , develops a higher angle of attack , and generates more lift . At high speeds , the force on the rotors is such that they `` flap '' excessively , and the retreating blade can reach too high an angle and stall . For this reason , the maximum safe forward airspeed of a helicopter is given a design rating called V , velocity , never exceed . In addition , it is possible for the helicopter to fly at an airspeed where an excessive amount of the retreating blade stalls , which results in high vibration , pitch - up , and roll into the retreating blade .
