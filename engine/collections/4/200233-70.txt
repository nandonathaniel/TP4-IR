The cast and crew flew back to Los Angeles and resumed filming at Fox studios on July 6 for all remaining scenes , including those in the villa dining room , ballroom , terrace , living room , and gazebo . Following the last two scenes shot in the gazebo -- for the songs `` Something Good '' and `` You Are Sixteen '' -- principal photography concluded on September 1 , 1964 . A total of eighty - three scenes were filmed in just over five months . Post-production work began on August 25 with three weeks of dialogue dubbing to correct lines that were ruined by various street noises and rain . In October , Christopher Plummer 's singing voice was dubbed by veteran Disney playback singer Bill Lee . The film was then edited by Wise and film editor William Reynolds . Once the film was edited , Irwin Kostal , who orchestrated the musical numbers , underscored the film with background music consisting of variations on Rodgers and Hammerstein 's original songs to amplify or add nuances to the visual images . When dubbing , editing , and scoring were complete , Wise arranged for two sneak - preview showings -- the first one held in Minneapolis on Friday January 15 , 1965 at the Mann Theater , and the second one held the following night in Tulsa . Despite the `` sensational '' responses from the preview audiences , Wise made a few final editing changes before completing the film . According to the original print information for the film , the running time for the theatrical release version was 174 minutes . The film was eventually given a G rating by the Motion Picture Association of America .
