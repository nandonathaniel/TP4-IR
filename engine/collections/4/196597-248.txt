1836 The U.S. House of Representatives passes the Pinckney Resolutions on May 26 , 1836 . The first two resolutions state that Congress has no constitutional authority to interfere with slavery in the states and that it `` ought not '' to do so in the District of Columbia . The third resolution , from the outset known as the `` gag rule '' , says : `` All petitions , memorials , resolutions , propositions , or papers , relating in any way , or to any extent whatsoever , to the subject of slavery or the abolition of slavery , shall , without being either printed or referred , be laid on the table and that no further action whatever shall be had thereon . '' Massachusetts representative and former President John Quincy Adams leads an eight - year battle against the gag rule . He argues that the Slave Power , as a political interest , threatened constitutional rights . Texas successfully declares its independence from Mexico . Arkansas , a slave state , is admitted to the Union . Committed abolitionists Angelina Grimké Weld and her sister Sarah Grimké who were born in Charleston , South Carolina , move to Philadelphia because of their anti-slavery philosophy and Quaker faith . In 1836 , Angelina publishes An Appeal to the Christian Women of the South , inviting them to overthrow slavery , which she declares is a horrible system of oppression and cruelty . Democratic Party nominee Martin Van Buren , a New Yorker with Southern sympathies , wins the Presidential election .
