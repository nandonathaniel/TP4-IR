Among large populated cities in the United States , Houston is unique as the largest city in the country with no zoning ordinances . Houston voters have rejected efforts to implement zoning in 1948 , 1962 , and 1993 . It is commonly believed that `` Houston is Houston '' because of the lack of zoning laws . Houston is similar , however , to other large cities throughout the Sun Belt , who all experienced the bulk of their population growth during the Age of the Automobile . The largest of these cities , such as Los Angeles , Atlanta , Miami , Tampa , Dallas , Phoenix , and Kansas City , have all experienced urban sprawl such as experienced by Houston despite having zoning systems .
