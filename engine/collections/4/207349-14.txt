Various constructions and strengths are available . Some touch fasteners are strong enough that a two - inch square ( 5 Ã— 5 cm ) piece is enough to support a 175 - pound ( 80 kg ) load . Fasteners made of Teflon loops , polyester hooks , and glass backing are used in aerospace applications , e.g. on space shuttles . The strength of the bond depends on how well the hooks are embedded in the loops , how much surface area is in contact with the hooks , and the nature of the force pulling it apart . If hook and loop is used to bond two rigid surfaces , such as auto body panels and frame , the bond is particularly strong because any force pulling the pieces apart is spread evenly across all hooks . Also , any force pushing the pieces together is disproportionately applied to engaging more hooks and loops . Vibration can cause rigid pieces to improve their bond . Full - body hook and loop suits have been made that can hold a person to a suitably covered wall .
