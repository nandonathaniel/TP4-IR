Railroads financing provided the basis for a dramatic expansion of the private ( non-governmental ) financial system . Construction of railroads was far more expensive than factories . In 1860 , the combined total of railroad stocks and bonds was $1.8 billion ; 1897 it reached $10.6 billion ( compared to a total national debt of $1.2 billion ) . Funding came from financiers throughout the Northeast , and from Europe , especially Britain . About 10 percent of the funding came from the government , especially in the form of land grants that could be realized when a certain amount of trackage was opened . The emerging American financial system was based on railroad bonds . New York by 1860 was the dominant financial market . The British invested heavily in railroads around the world , but nowhere more so than the United States ; The total came to about $3 billion by 1914 . In 1914 -- 1917 , they liquidated their American assets to pay for war supplies .
