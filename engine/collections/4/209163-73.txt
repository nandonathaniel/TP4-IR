May of the street sets were filmed at Warner Brothers Burbank . Production designer , Dale Hennesy , overhauled the old `` Tenement Street '' back lot set at Warner Brothers Burbank studios outfitting many of the New York styled apartment and store front facades with actual New York fire escapes and other treatments specifically brought in for this production . Hennesy passed away during filming and the back lot set was renamed `` Hennesy Street '' for the late production designer .
