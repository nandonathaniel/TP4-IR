From 1956 to 1964 , West and East Germany attended the Winter and Summer Olympic Games as a single team , known as the United Team of Germany . After the East German national flag was changed in 1959 , neither country accepted the flag of the other . As a compromise , a new flag was used by the United Team of Germany from 1960 to 1964 , featuring the black - red - gold tricolour defaced with white Olympic rings in the red stripe . In 1968 the teams from the two German states entered separately , but both used the same German Olympic flag . From 1972 to 1988 , the separate West and East German teams used their respective national flags .
