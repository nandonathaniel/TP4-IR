According to research by CDIAC meteorologist Dale Kaiser , the United States during the second half of the 20th century experienced declining frequencies of white Christmases , especially in the northeastern region . The National Climatic Data Center based the probability of a white Christmas ( 1 in or 2.5 cm of snow on the ground ) at selected cities upon the 1988 -- 2005 numbers from stations with at least 25 years of data .
