Individual pieces of copper were sometimes given names based on their value . The value of any given piece was defined by the number of wool blankets last traded for them . In this system , it was considered prestigious for a buyer to purchase the same piece of copper at a higher price than it was previously sold , in their version of an art market . During potlatch , copper pieces would be brought out , and bids were placed on them by rival chiefs . The highest bidder would have the honour of buying said copper piece . If a host still held a surplus of copper after throwing an expensive potlatch , he was considered a wealthy and important man . Highly ranked members of the communities often have the Kwak'wala word for `` copper '' as part of their names .
