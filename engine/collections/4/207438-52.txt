The functional study of criminal justice is distinct from criminology , which involves the study of crime as a social phenomenon , causes of crime , criminal behavior , and other aspects of crime . It emerged as an academic discipline in the 1920s , beginning with Berkeley police chief August Vollmer who established a criminal justice program at the University of California , Berkeley in 1916 . Vollmer 's work was carried on by his student , O.W. Wilson , who led efforts to professionalize policing and reduce corruption . Other programs were established in the United States at Indiana University , Michigan State University , San Jose State University , and the University of Washington . As of 1950 , criminal justice students were estimated to number less than 1,000 . Until the 1960s , the primary focus of criminal justice in the United States was on policing and police science .
