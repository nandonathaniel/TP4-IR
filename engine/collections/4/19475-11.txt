The Law of 22 Prairial , proposed by the Committee of Public Safety and enacted on 10 June 1794 , went further in establishing the iron control of the Revolutionary Tribunal and , above it , the Committees of Public Safety and General Security . The law enumerated various forms of public enemies , made mandatory their denunciation , and severely limited the legal recourse available to those accused . The punishment for all crimes under the Law of 22 Prairal was death . From the initiation of this law to the fall of Robespierre on 27 July , more people were condemned to death than in the entire previous history of the Revolutionary Tribunal .
