Despite Pan Am 's precarious financial situation , in summer 1984 Acker went ahead with an order for new Airbus models in wide body and narrowbodied aircraft , becoming the second American company to order Airbus aircraft , after Eastern Air Lines . These advanced aircraft , economically and operationally superior to the 747s and 727s Pan Am operated at the time , were intended to make the airline more competitive . New A300s began replacing 727s on the Internal German Services ( IGS ) and Caribbean networks later the same year while new A310s later replaced some of the 747s on the slimmed - down transatlantic network following ETOPS certification ( approval by the Federal Aviation Administration ( FAA ) of transoceanic flying with twin - engined aircraft ) . Pan Am 's decision not to take delivery of the A320s and to sell its delivery positions to Braniff meant that the majority of its short - haul U.S. domestic and European feeder routes , and most of its IGS services , continued to be flown with obsolete 727s until the airline 's demise . This put it at a disadvantage against rivals operating state - of - the - art aircraft with greater passenger appeal . In September 1984 Pan American World Airways created a holding company called Pan Am Corporation to assume ownership and control of the airline and the services division .
