Aeneas finishes his story , and Dido realizes that she has fallen in love with Aeneas . Juno seizes upon this opportunity to make a deal with Venus , Aeneas 's mother , with the intention of distracting Aeneas from his destiny of founding a city in Italy . Aeneas is inclined to return Dido 's love , and during a hunting expedition , a storm drives them into a cave in which Aeneas and Dido presumably have sex , an event that Dido takes to indicate a marriage between them . But when Jupiter sends Mercury to remind Aeneas of his duty , he has no choice but to part . Her heart broken , Dido commits suicide by stabbing herself upon a pyre with Aeneas 's sword . Before dying , she predicts eternal strife between Aeneas 's people and hers ; `` rise up from my bones , avenging spirit '' ( 4.625 , trans . Fitzgerald ) is a possible invocation to Hannibal . Looking back from the deck of his ship , Aeneas sees the smoke of Dido 's funeral pyre and knows its meaning only too clearly . Nevertheless , destiny calls , and the Trojan fleet sails on to Italy .
