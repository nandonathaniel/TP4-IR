The third season , American Horror Story : Coven , received positive reviews . Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reported that 84 % of 34 critics gave the season a positive review . The site 's consensus reads : `` A noteworthy ensemble cast combined with creepy storytelling and campy , outrageous thrills make American Horror Story : Coven a potently structured fright-fest . '' It scored 71 out of 100 on Metacritic based on 24 reviews , the highest score for the show to that point . Not all reviews were positive , however , with criticism focused mainly in regards to the progression of both the story and certain character arcs in the second half of the season . The A.V. Club gave this season the low rating of a D+ , with critic Todd Van DerWerff remarking : `` It lurched drunkenly from idea to idea , never settling on one long enough to build anything of worth . ''
