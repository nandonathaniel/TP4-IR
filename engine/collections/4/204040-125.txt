If further elements with higher atomic numbers than this are discovered , they will be placed in additional periods , laid out ( as with the existing periods ) to illustrate periodically recurring trends in the properties of the elements concerned . Any additional periods are expected to contain a larger number of elements than the seventh period , as they are calculated to have an additional so - called g - block , containing at least 18 elements with partially filled g - orbitals in each period .
