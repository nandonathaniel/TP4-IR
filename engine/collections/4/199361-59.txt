There is a large debate on whether or not cheerleading should be considered a sport for Title IX ( a portion of the United States Education Amendments of 1972 forbidding discrimination under any education program on the basis of sex ) purposes . Supporters consider cheerleading , as a whole , a sport , citing the heavy use of athletic talents while critics see it as a physical activity because a `` sport '' implies a competition among all squads and not all squads compete , along with subjectivity of competitions where -- as with gymnastics , diving , and figure skating -- scores are assessed based on human judgment and not an objective goal or measurement of time .
