The cytochrome c oxidase complex is highly efficient at reducing oxygen to water , and it releases very few partly reduced intermediates ; however small amounts of superoxide anion and peroxide are produced by the electron transport chain . Particularly important is the reduction of coenzyme Q in complex III , as a highly reactive ubisemiquinone free radical is formed as an intermediate in the Q cycle . This unstable species can lead to electron `` leakage '' when electrons transfer directly to oxygen , forming superoxide . As the production of reactive oxygen species by these proton - pumping complexes is greatest at high membrane potentials , it has been proposed that mitochondria regulate their activity to maintain the membrane potential within a narrow range that balances ATP production against oxidant generation . For instance , oxidants can activate uncoupling proteins that reduce membrane potential .
