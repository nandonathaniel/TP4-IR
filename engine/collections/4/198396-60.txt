Lucas decided to make elaborate costumes because the film 's society was more sophisticated than the one depicted in the original trilogy . Designer Trisha Biggar and her team created over 1,000 costumes that were inspired by various cultures . Biggar worked closely with concept designer Iain McCaig to create a color palette for the inhabitants of each world : Tatooine followed A New Hope with sun - bleached sand colors , Coruscant had grays , browns and blacks , and Naboo had green and gold for humans while Gungans wore `` a leathery look , like their skin '' . The Jedi costumes followed the tradition from the original film ; Obi - Wan 's costume was inspired by the costume that was worn by Guinness . Lucas said he and Biggar would look at the conceptual art to `` translat ( e ) all of these designs into cloth and fabric and materials that would actually work and not look silly '' . Biggar also consulted Gillard to ensure the costumes would accommodate action scenes , and consulted the creature department to find which fabrics `` would n't wear too heavily '' on the alien skins . A huge wardrobe department was set up at Leavesden Film Studios to create over 250 costumes for the main actors and 5,000 for the background ones .
