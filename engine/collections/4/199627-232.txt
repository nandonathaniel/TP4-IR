Olivier Roy estimates that after four years of war , there were at least 4,000 bases from which mujahideen units operated . Most of these were affiliated with the seven expatriate parties headquartered in Pakistan , which served as sources of supply and varying degrees of supervision . Significant commanders typically led 300 or more men , controlled several bases and dominated a district or a sub-division of a province . Hierarchies of organization above the bases were attempted . Their operations varied greatly in scope , the most ambitious being achieved by Ahmad Shah Massoud of the Panjshir valley north of Kabul . He led at least 10,000 trained troopers at the end of the Soviet war and had expanded his political control of Tajik - dominated areas to Afghanistan 's northeastern provinces under the Supervisory Council of the North .
