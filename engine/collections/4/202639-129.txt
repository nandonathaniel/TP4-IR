Wallace had to make a choice : he could launch an attack and fight through the Confederate rear to reach Grant 's forces closer to Pittsburg Landing , or reverse his direction and march toward Pittsburg Landing via a crossroads to the River Road . Wallace chose the second option . ( After the war , Wallace claimed that his division might have attacked and defeated the Confederates if his advance had not been interrupted , but later conceded that the move would not have been successful . ) Rather than realign his troops so the rear guard would be in the front , Wallace made a controversial decision to countermarch his troops to maintain the original order , only facing in the other direction . The move further delayed Wallace 's troops as they marched north along the Shunpike road , then took a crossover to reach the River Road to the east , and headed south toward the battlefield .
