The sound of rock is traditionally centered on the amplified electric guitar , which emerged in its modern form in the 1950s with the popularization of rock and roll , and was influenced by the sounds of electric blues guitarists . The sound of an electric guitar in rock music is typically supported by an electric bass guitar , which pioneered in jazz music in the same era , and percussion produced from a drum kit that combines drums and cymbals . This trio of instruments has often been complemented by the inclusion of other instruments , particularly keyboards such as the piano , Hammond organ and synthesizers . The basic rock instrumentation was adapted from the basic blues band instrumentation ( prominent lead guitar , second chordal instrument , bass , and drums ) . A group of musicians performing rock music is termed a rock band or rock group and typically consists of between three -- the power trio -- and five members . Classically , a rock band takes the form of a quartet whose members cover one or more roles , including vocalist , lead guitarist , rhythm guitarist , bass guitarist , drummer and often that of keyboard player or other instrumentalist .
