Lake Superior has fewer dissolved nutrients relative to its water volume than the other Great Lakes and so is less productive in terms of fish populations and is an oligotrophic lake . This is a result of the underdeveloped soils found in its relatively small watershed . However , nitrate concentrations in the lake have been continuously rising for more than a century . They are still much lower than levels considered dangerous to human health ; but this steady , long - term rise is an unusual record of environmental nitrogen buildup . It may relate to anthropogenic alternations to the regional nitrogen cycle , but researchers are still unsure of the causes of this change to the lake 's ecology .
