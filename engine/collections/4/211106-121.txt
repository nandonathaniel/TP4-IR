Many people also had a genuine ideological attachment to the `` monarchical '' principle . As the analogy of the Dutch Republic with the biblical People of Israel was never far from people 's minds , this helped to give an important underpinning for the Orangist claims in the mind of the common people , who were greatly influenced from the pulpit . The Prince of Orange was seen in his traditional role as the leader of the nation in its independence movement , and its protector from foreign threats . References to biblical kings were never far from most of the Calvinist preacher 's sermons . Other favourite metaphors were the likening of the Princes of Orange to Moses leading the people of the Netherlands out of the Spanish `` house of bondage '' . Given the prevalence of dangers from floods , the Lord was seen as having placed the protection of the Dutch people from inundation , both physical and metaphysical religious terms in the hands of the Princes of Orange . Of course , the conservative Calvinist Reformed Church thought its interests best served by the Stadtholder from the House of Orange who had served them in the Remonstrant -- Counter-Remonstrant controversy in 1619 under Maurice of Orange that culminated in the Synod of Dort . The Erastianism of the Holland regents was seen as a constant threat to its independence and orthodoxy .
