The representativeness , accountability and legitimacy of NGOs has been questioned especially given that NGOs are not elected by the constituents they wish to represent . In that context , states such as China make significant efforts to monitor and regulate the activities and development of NGOs . Nonetheless , NGOs have increasingly been able to operate without a government sponsoring unit , though this is only true for a small number of NGOs that operate in pre-approved categories , and they continue to face institutional constraints . Similarly , the development work of NGOs abroad has been constrained by the domestic politics and regulatory frameworks of host jurisdictions . This has occurred in spite of the fact that such NGOs enjoy high levels of international development assistance from strong state sponsors such as China .
