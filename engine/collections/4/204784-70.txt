In the chaos of the late 12th century , a chieftain named Tem√ºjin finally succeeded in uniting the Mongol tribes between Manchuria and the Altai Mountains . In 1206 , he took the title Genghis Khan , and waged a series of military campaigns -- renowned for their brutality and ferocity -- sweeping through much of Asia , and forming the Mongol Empire , the largest contiguous land empire in world history . Under his successors it stretched from present - day Poland in the west to Korea in the east , and from Siberia in the north to the Gulf of Oman and Vietnam in the south , covering some 33,000,000 square kilometres ( 13,000,000 sq mi ) , ( 22 % of Earth 's total land area ) and having a population of over 100 million people ( about a quarter of Earth 's total population at the time ) . The emergence of Pax Mongolica also significantly eased trade and commerce across Asia during its height .
