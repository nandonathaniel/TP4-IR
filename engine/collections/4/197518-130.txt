Built as a monument to the westward expansion of the United States , the arch typifies `` the pioneer spirit of the men and women who won the West , and those of a latter day to strive on other frontiers . '' The arch has become the iconic image of St. Louis , appearing in many parts of city culture . In 1968 , three years after the monument 's opening , the St. Louis phone directory contained 65 corporations with `` Gateway '' in their title and 17 with `` Arch '' . Arches also appeared over gas stations and drive - in restaurants . In the 1970s , a local sports team adopted the name `` Fighting Arches '' ; St. Louis Community College would later ( when consolidating all athletic programs under a single banner ) name its sports teams `` Archers '' . Robert S. Chandler , an NPS superintendent , said , `` Most ( visitors ) are awed by the size and scale of the Arch , but they do n't understand what it 's all about ... Too many people see it as just a symbol of the city of St. Louis . ''
