The principal quantum number ( n ) describes the electron shell , or energy level , of an electron . The value of n ranges from 1 to the shell containing the outermost electron of that atom , i.e. n = 1 , 2 , ... For example , in caesium ( Cs ) , the outermost valence electron is in the shell with energy level 6 , so an electron in caesium can have an n value from 1 to 6 . For particles in a time - independent potential ( see Schrödinger equation ) , it also labels the nth eigenvalue of Hamiltonian ( H ) , i.e. the energy , E with the contribution due to angular momentum ( the term involving J ) left out . This number therefore has a dependence only on the distance between the electron and the nucleus ( i.e. , the radial coordinate , r ) . The average distance increases with n , and hence quantum states with different principal quantum numbers are said to belong to different shells . The azimuthal quantum number ( l ) ( also known as the angular quantum number or orbital quantum number ) describes the subshell , and gives the magnitude of the orbital angular momentum through the relation L = ħ l ( l + 1 ) . In chemistry and spectroscopy , `` l = 0 '' is called an s orbital , `` l = 1 '' ap orbital , `` l = 2 '' ad orbital , and `` l = 3 '' an f orbital . The value of l ranges from 0 to n − 1 , so the first p orbital ( l = 1 ) appears in the second electron shell ( n = 2 ) , the first d orbital ( l = 2 ) appears in the third shell ( n = 3 ) , and so on : l = 0 , 1 , 2 , ... , n − 1 . A quantum number beginning in 3 , 0 , ... describes an electron in the s orbital of the third electron shell of an atom . In chemistry , this quantum number is very important , since it specifies the shape of an atomic orbital and strongly influences chemical bonds and bond angles . The magnetic quantum number ( m ) describes the specific orbital ( or `` cloud '' ) within that subshell , and yields the projection of the orbital angular momentum along a specified axis : L = m ħ . The values of m range from − l to l , with integer steps between them : The s subshell ( l = 0 ) contains only one orbital , and therefore the m of an electron in an s orbital will always be 0 . The p subshell ( l = 1 ) contains three orbitals ( in some systems , depicted as three `` dumbbell - shaped '' clouds ) , so the m of an electron in ap orbital will be − 1 , 0 , or 1 . The d subshell ( l = 2 ) contains five orbitals , with m values of − 2 , − 1 , 0 , 1 , and 2 . The spin projection quantum number ( m ) describes the spin ( intrinsic angular momentum ) of the electron within that orbital , and gives the projection of the spin angular momentum S along the specified axis : S = m ħ . In general , the values of m range from − s to s , where s is the spin quantum number , an intrinsic property of particles : m = − s , − s + 1 , − s + 2 , ... , s − 2 , s − 1 , s . An electron has spin number s = 1⁄2 , consequently m will be ± 1⁄2 , referring to `` spin up '' and `` spin down '' states . Each electron in any individual orbital must have different quantum numbers because of the Pauli exclusion principle , therefore an orbital never contains more than two electrons .
