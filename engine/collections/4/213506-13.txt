In drama , farces , musical burlesques , extravaganzas and comic operas competed with Shakespeare productions and serious drama by the likes of James Planché and Thomas William Robertson . In 1855 , the German Reed Entertainments began a process of elevating the level of ( formerly risqué ) musical theatre in Britain that culminated in the famous series of comic operas by Gilbert and Sullivan and were followed by the 1890s with the first Edwardian musical comedies . The first play to achieve 500 consecutive performances was the London comedy Our Boys by H.J. Byron , opening in 1875 . Its astonishing new record of 1,362 performances was bested in 1892 by Charley 's Aunt by Brandon Thomas . After W.S. Gilbert , Oscar Wilde became the leading poet and dramatist of the late Victorian period . Wilde 's plays , in particular , stand apart from the many now forgotten plays of Victorian times and have a closer relationship to those of the Edwardian dramatists such as George Bernard Shaw , whose career began in the 1890s . Wilde 's 1895 comic masterpiece , The Importance of Being Earnest , was the greatest of the plays in which he held an ironic mirror to the aristocracy while displaying virtuosic mastery of wit and paradoxical wisdom . It has remained extremely popular .
