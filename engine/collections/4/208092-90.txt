Note that the Harris Interactive Poll ( 2005 -- 2013 ) was contracted by the BCS to help formulate its standings , and although its final ranking which occurs prior to the bowl games is listed in the official NCAA Football Bowl Subdivision Records , it does not conduct a final poll or award or name a national champion on its own .
