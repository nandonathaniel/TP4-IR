A study by Oxford Economics for the Law Society of England and Wales has suggested that Brexit would have a particularly large negative impact on the UK financial services industry and the law firms that support it , which could cost the law sector as much as Â£ 1.7 bn per annum by 2030 . The Law Society 's own report into the possible effects of Brexit notes that leaving the EU would be likely to reduce the role played by the UK as a centre for resolving disputes between foreign firms , whilst a potential loss of `` passporting '' rights would require financial services firms to transfer departments responsible for regulatory oversight overseas .
