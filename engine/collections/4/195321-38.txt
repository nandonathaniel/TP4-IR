`` No Church in the Wild '' received mostly positive reviews from music critics and was often described as a highlight from Watch the Throne . Andy Gill of The Independent stated `` the best track is surely the opener ' No Church in the Wild ' , whose deep , detuned twang groove , over a marching organ motif , is the most striking music on the album , promising rather more than the rest of the record is able to deliver . Both this and the other stand - out track , `` Made In America '' , feature assured vocal refrains from Frank Ocean , while the two rappers muse over familiar themes of loyalty , sexuality and maternal solidarity . '' Rolling Stone claims that it is one of the most musically impressive songs on Watch the Throne and describes the production as an `` ominous , darkly funky bass groove and chilly synths tailor - made for Ocean 's off - kilter crooning . '' Matt Popkin from American Songwriter praised Jay Z 's verse and the menacing vibe of the song . NOW claims that `` uncomfortably visceral opener ' No Church In The Wild ' -- with its filthy Phil Manzanera guitar sample and mournful Frank Ocean chorus -- cuts to the heart of Watch The Throne 's power dynamic . '' However , PopMatters criticized that the verses `` feel a little out of focus compared to the hook and beat 's opulence . '' Sputnikmusic 's Tyler Fisher commented `` 88 - Keys creates a positively epic opening track with ' No Church in the Wild ' , full of creeping guitar riffs and pulsating bass , building tension that simply never releases . '' Rolling Stone named the track the sixth best song of the year , reporting that `` with Hov and Yeezy getting deep into arcane theology , this track is just another high . ''
