At a 1997 `` Special Edition '' press conference , Lucas said : `` Everyone said , ' Well , are you going to do sequels to the first three ? ' But that was an afterthought ; I do n't have scripts on those stories . The only notion on that was , would n't it be fun to get all the actors to come back when they 're 60 or 70 years old and make three more about them as old people . '' In a 1997 issue of Star Wars Insider , he said : `` The whole story has six episodes ... If I ever went beyond that , it would be something that was made up . I really do n't have any notion other than , ' Gee , it would be interesting to do Luke Skywalker later on . ' It would n't be part of the main story , but a sequel to this thing . ''
