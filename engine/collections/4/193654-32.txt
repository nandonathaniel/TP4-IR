Following a failed attempt to contain a riot at a prison in New Baghdad , the Atlas Corporation releases the Manticore bioweapon in order to end the battle . However , instead of killing the rioters , the Manticore bomb reanimates them as zombies . Three platoons are sent in to cage the undead forces , but only one survives , and the others are brought back to an Atlas research facility for further studies . The research is carried out in secret , without the knowledge of the employees of said facility , in a hidden area known as Sublevel 6 . One night , the captured zombies break out of their containment and overrun the facility , infecting Atlas personnel in the process . Amidst the chaos , four Atlas employees - the janitor Oz ( John Malkovich ) , the IT specialist Lilith ( Rose McGowan ) , the security guard Decker ( Jon Bernthal ) , and the executive Kahn ( Bill Paxton ) - attempt to evacuate , but both of their rescue helicopters are destroyed . The four survivors mount a last stand against the zombie horde , but are eventually defeated . However , they are rescued by Atlas forces , who then take them to an urban facility , for medical treatment . When the four survivors recover , they are thrown into another battle against the infected , ensuring the survival of not only themselves but also innocent citizens trapped in the vicinity .
