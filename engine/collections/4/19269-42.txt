International capital was increasingly attracted by the island 's natural resources . A Canadian firm opened iron mines in 1895 on Bell Island in Conception Bay . Paper mills were built at Grand Falls by the Anglo - Newfoundland Development Company , a British firm , in 1909 . British entrepreneurs set up a paper mill at Corner Brook in 1925 while the Anglo - Newfoundland Development Company opened a lead - zinc mine on the Buchans River in 1927 . In 1927 , Britain awarded the vast , almost uninhabited hinterland of Labrador to Newfoundland rather than to Canada , adding potentially valuable new forest , hydroelectric , and mineral resources .
