The mammalian heart has four chambers , two upper atria , the receiving chambers , and two lower ventricles , the discharging chambers . The heart has four valves , which separate its chambers and ensures blood flows in the correct direction through the heart ( preventing backflow ) . After gas exchange in the pulmonary capillaries ( blood vessels in the lungs ) , oxygen - rich blood returns to the left atrium via one of the four pulmonary veins . Blood flows nearly continuously back into the atrium , which acts as the receiving chamber , and from here through an opening into the left ventricle . Most blood flows passively into the heart while both the atria and ventricles are relaxed , but toward the end of the ventricular relaxation period , the left atrium will contract , pumping blood into the ventricle . The heart also requires nutrients and oxygen found in blood like other muscles , and is supplied via coronary arteries .
