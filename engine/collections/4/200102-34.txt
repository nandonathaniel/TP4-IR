As a result of the Partitions , Poles were forced to seek a change of status quo in Europe . Polish poets , politicians , noblemen , writers , artists , many of whom were forced to emigrate ( thus the term Great Emigration ) , became the revolutionaries of the 19th century , as desire for freedom became one of the defining parts of Polish romanticism . Polish revolutionaries participated in uprisings in Prussia , the Austrian Empire and Imperial Russia . Polish legions fought alongside Napoleon and , under the slogan of For our freedom and yours , participated widely in the Spring of Nations ( particularly the Hungarian Revolution of 1848 ) .
