Arterioles carrying blood to superficial capillaries under the surface of the skin can shrink ( constrict ) , thereby rerouting blood away from the skin and towards the warmer core of the body . This prevents blood from losing heat to the surroundings and also prevents the core temperature dropping further . This process is called vasoconstriction . It is impossible to prevent all heat loss from the blood , only to reduce it . In extremely cold conditions , excessive vasoconstriction leads to numbness and pale skin . Frostbite occurs only when water within the cells begins to freeze . This destroys the cell causing damage .
