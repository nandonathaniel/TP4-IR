Bono described 1986 as `` an incredibly bad year '' for him , which was reflected in the lyrics . His marriage was under strain , in part due to the album 's long gestation period , the band were criticised by the Irish media for their involvement in Self Aid , and his personal assistant Greg Carroll was killed in a motorcycle accident . Bono said , `` That 's why the desert attracted me as an image . That year was really a desert for us . '' `` With or Without You '' was written while he was struggling to reconcile his wanderlust as a musician with his domestic responsibilities . `` One Tree Hill '' , named after a volcanic peak in Carroll 's native New Zealand , describes how Bono felt at Carroll 's funeral . The album is dedicated to his memory .
