The expression Order of Mass is particularly tied to the Roman Rite where the sections under that title in the Roman Missal also contain a set of liturgical texts that recur in most or in all Eucharistic liturgies ( the so - called invariable texts , or ordinary of the Mass ) , while the rubrics indicate the rituals , and the insertion points of the variable texts known as the proper of the Mass . Having been virtually unchanged for many centuries , the Roman Catholic Order of Mass changed decisively after the Second Vatican Council .
