The first batch , known by enthusiasts as the `` Wooler - Hodec cars '' , were converted by the UK company of that name . Evidence still exists in the form of a DMC factory memo which orders 20 cars to be converted to right - hand drive . Due to the factory 's closure , this order was never completed and today a total of 13 cars survive , carrying the VINs : 510 , 12171 -- 12181 & 12199 . VIN 510 is understood to be the first of this batch of cars converted and was later sold at the factory auction in 1984 . The other twelve cars were auctioned off by the receivers in early 1983 . As a result , several of these cars were registered at the same time and have the Northern Irish registration ( license ) number `` SIJ xxxx '' . All of this first batch of cars had a black interior and all had manual transmission except VIN 12175 . This car is the only factory - authorized right - hand drive black interior automatic car and is owned by Andrew Withers , former editor of the UK DeLorean Owners Club . The second batch were registered and used by the factory in Northern Ireland , with registration numbers ( license plates ) , AXI 1697 , AXI 1698 , AXI 1699 and are referred to by enthusiasts as the `` AXI cars '' . These three cars ( VINs 5565 , 5592 and 5638 ) differ from the first Wooler - Hodec cars in several ways . These three cars all had roof mounted radio antennas , indicator repeater lights , no side marker lights , white forward - facing door lights , fog - light switch , and textured body rubstrips on the stainless panels . No catalytic converters or Lambda equipment were fitted as British legislation did not require them . VIN 5565 with the registration number AXI 1697 was a fully UK homologated example which would have been shown at the British motor show at Birmingham , UK in October 1982 . It includes a unique rearward - facing twin exhaust , no catalytic converters and the UK specification engine as used by Volvo , but retaining the usual Renault ancillaries . The transmission final drive was also set at 3.88 : 1 versus the standard 3.44 : 1 . Attention was paid to other unique details such as correctly offset wing mirrors .
