Dhar Tichitt and Oualata were prominent among the early urban centres , dated to 2000 BCE , in present - day Mauritania . About 500 stone settlements littered the region in the former savannah of the Sahara . Its inhabitants fished and grew millet . It has been found that the Soninke of the Mand√© peoples , who , according to their tradition , originate from Aswan , Egypt , were responsible for constructing such settlements . Around 300 BCE , the region became more desiccated and the settlements began to decline , most likely relocating to Koumbi Saleh . From the type of architecture and pottery , it is believed that Tichit was related to the subsequent Ghana Empire . Old Jenne ( Djenne ) began to be settled around 300 BCE , producing iron and with sizeable population , evidenced in crowded cemeteries . Living structures were made of sun - dried mud . By 250 BCE , Jenne was a large , thriving market town .
