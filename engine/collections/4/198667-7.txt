Ancient Greek , Egyptian , and Roman troops kept to the left when marching . In 1998 , archaeologists found a well - preserved double track leading to a Roman quarry near Swindon , in southern England . The grooves in the road on the left side ( viewed facing down the track away from the quarry ) were much deeper than those on the right side , suggesting LHT , at least at this location , since carts would exit the quarry heavily loaded , and enter it empty .
