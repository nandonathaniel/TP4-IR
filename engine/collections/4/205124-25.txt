The ride can accommodate up to four riders , and consists of three main sections ; the loading and unloading station , the lift tower , and the drop and run - out track . Riders are loaded into a gondola type car near ground level at the station and secured with over the shoulder harnesses . The gondola is then moved backwards horizontally to the rear base of the lift tower and then climbs vertically to the top of the tower in 7.2 seconds . Once there , it slides forward and hangs over the drop track for a few seconds . Without warning , the car is released and riders drop 60 feet in less than two seconds before experiencing the deceleration g - forces as the car enters a pull - out curve which transitions the vertical fall into a horizontal brake run . As the gondola rolls through the brake run to slow down , the riders are facing the sky . Once it stops at the end of the run , a mechanism swings the top of the car down , and the gondola moves in reverse at a downward 45 degree angle to another track where it returns to an upright position . It then returns to the station in reverse traveling below the brake run track .
