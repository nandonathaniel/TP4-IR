During a crisis caused when Wonder Woman 's Lasso of Truth was broken , resulting in the laws of truth breaking down and causing reality to be shaped by the perceptions of individuals , one of the symptoms was when Batman found himself unable to solve any of the Riddler 's riddles , but was nevertheless still able to defeat Riddler as Riddler himself could not solve the riddles either -- most likely reflecting the public idea of Riddler 's puzzles being insoluble -- claiming that he managed to `` improvise '' to defeat Riddler . His low reputation among heroes and villains was reflected when the Flash noted that Batman having trouble with Riddler was a clear sign that the world was ending .
