When trying to define rigorously whether an arrangement of atoms is sufficiently stable to be considered a molecule , IUPAC suggests that it `` must correspond to a depression on the potential energy surface that is deep enough to confine at least one vibrational state '' . This definition does not depend on the nature of the interaction between the atoms , but only on the strength of the interaction . In fact , it includes weakly bound species that would not traditionally be considered molecules , such as the helium dimer , He , which has one vibrational bound state and is so loosely bound that it is only likely to be observed at very low temperatures .
