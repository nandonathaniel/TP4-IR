Film historian Laurent Bouzereau notes in his 1997 book Star Wars : The Annotated Screenplays that in the rough draft of Star Wars , Leia is the spoiled teenage daughter of King Kayos and Queen Breha of Aquilae , with two brothers , Biggs and Windy ; Biggs returned to the fourth draft as a childhood friend of Luke . According to Skywalking : The Life and Films of George Lucas ( 1999 ) , Luke Skywalker was originally Luke Starkiller and Leia was `` the daughter of Owen Lars and his wife Beru and seems to be Luke 's cousin -- together they visit the grave of his mother , who perished with his father on a planet destroyed by the Death Star . '' J.W. Rinzler explains in The Making of Star Wars : The Definitive Story Behind the Original Film ( 2007 ) that a later story synopsis establishes Leia as `` Leia Antilles '' , the daughter of Bail Antilles from the peaceful world of Organa Major . In the fourth draft it was established that `` Leia Organa '' came instead from Alderaan .
