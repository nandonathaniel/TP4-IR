The amount of money required as an investment by foreigners to obtain the visa has risen over the years . In 1991 a foreign investor was required to invest only 25 million won , then in 2001 this was raised to 50 million won . In 2010 the government announced that it was looking to increase this further to 100 million for a number of reasons . Due to inflation , a rise in the cost of living and other costs they felt that 100 million was more representative of what was required as a minimum investment to start a business in Korea . However , there was also concern that some foreigners were taking advantage of the visa and using it to reside permanently in Korea without actually creating any business . Once the visa has been issued the government does n't keep track of the investment , so some foreigners were using agents who provided the investment money for a fee in order for them to obtain the visa . Concern was raised that the increase would do nothing to deter abuse of the visa and would instead discourage foreign investment in Korea . The regulations surrounding the visa and foreign business ownership have been criticized for requiring a Korean guarantor even though the foreigner has invested a large sum of money and been given permission to open nearly any business they wish .
