The Klondike Gold Rush was a migration by an estimated 100,000 prospectors to the Klondike region of the Yukon in north - western Canada between 1896 and 1899 . Gold was discovered there by local miners on August 16 , 1896 , and , when news reached Seattle and San Francisco the following year , it triggered a stampede of prospectors . Some became wealthy , but the majority went in vain . It has been immortalized in photographs , books , films , and artifacts .
