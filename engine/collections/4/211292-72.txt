The left and right sides of the brain appear symmetrical , but they function asymmetrically . For example , the counterpart of the left - hemisphere motor area controlling the right hand is the right - hemisphere area controlling the left hand . There are , however , several important exceptions , involving language and spatial cognition . The left frontal lobe is dominant for language . If a key language area in the left hemisphere is damaged , it can leave the victim unable to speak or understand , whereas equivalent damage to the right hemisphere would cause only minor impairment to language skills .
