Like the Irish and Italian , the Jewish community has played an important role in recent New York City politics ; Jewish voters traditionally vote in large numbers and have often supported politically liberal policies . As the proportion of liberal Conservative and Reform Jews decreases and that of conservative Russian and Orthodox Jews increases in the 21st Century the political interests of New York Jews are changing . The Russian immigrants have shown a tendency to vote Republican while the ultra-orthodox are social conservatives who have a pressing need for supportive social services . There is little support among either group for the liberal community institutions which have been built by the liberal Jewish community . A significant portion of the rapidly growing Hasidic community is pro-Israel and supports the Israeli Settlement Movement .
