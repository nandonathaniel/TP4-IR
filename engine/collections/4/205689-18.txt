The `` Great American Pyramid '' was conceived originally by Mark C. Hartz , a Memphis artist in about 1954 . The project originally included three pyramids located on the south bluffs of Memphis overlooking the Mississippi River . The largest of the three would have been two - third scale of the Great Pyramid of Giza near Memphis , Egypt ; the flanking structures would have been scaled at two - thirds the size of the main pyramid . The project languished for three decades until Mark 's younger son , Memphian Jon Brent Hartz , resurrected the concept . Mark C. Hartz , who was well known for his architectural renderings , rendered a new bronze glass - glazed pyramid . After years of negotiations , the younger Hartz 's concept was adopted by entrepreneur John Tigrett as a symbol for the city of Memphis . The groundbreaking ceremony was held on September 15 , 1989 and the building was opened on November 9 , 1991 .
