On May 10 , 2013 , ABC announced that it had greenlit the spin - off , as well as also announcing that John Lithgow would replace Reubens as the voice of the White Rabbit . On May 14 , 2013 , ABC announced that the spin - off will air in the Thursday night timeslot instead of making it a fill - in for the parent series . `` We really want to tell the story without having to worry about how to stretch it for five years , '' said Edward Kitsis . `` This is not meant to be a 22 - episode season . Whatever it ends up being , we 'll have told a complete story ... '' It was revealed in August at the TCA Summer Press Tour that , contrary to previous reports that more than 13 episodes were ordered straight out the gate , only the usual amount of 13 episodes had been ordered . Edward Kitsis and Adam Horowitz commented `` However many we wind up doing this season , what we 're planning to do is tell a kind of complete tale with a beginning , middle and end '' and added `` If it does well ( and ) people like it , hopefully we 'll come back and tell another adventure with this cast .
