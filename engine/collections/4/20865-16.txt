The term `` better than evens '' ( or `` worse than evens '' ) varies in meaning depending on context . Looked at from the perspective of a gambler rather than a statistician , `` better than evens '' means `` odds against '' . If the odds are evens ( 1 / 1 ) , and one bets 10 units , one would be returned 20 units , making a profit of 10 units . If the gamble was paying 4 / 1 and the event occurred , one would make 50 units , or a profit of 40 units . So , it is `` better than evens '' from the gambler 's perspective because it pays out more than one - for - one . If an event is more likely to occur than an even chance , then the odds will be `` worse than evens '' , and the bookmaker will pay out less than one - for - one .
