Whatever the causes , however , psychoticism marks the two approaches apart , as the five factor model contains no such trait . Moreover , psychoticism , unlike any of the other factors in either approach , does not fit a normal distribution curve . Indeed , scores are rarely high , thus skewing a normal distribution . However , when they are high , there is considerable overlap with psychiatric conditions such as antisocial and schizoid personality disorders . Similarly , high scorers on neuroticism are more susceptible to sleep and psychosomatic disorders . Five factor approaches can also predict future mental disorders .
