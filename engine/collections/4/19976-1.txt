`` The Death of the Hired Man '' is a long poem primarily concerning a conversation , over a short time period in a single evening , between a farmer ( Warren ) and his wife ( Mary ) about what to do with an ex-employee named Silas , who helped with haymaking and left the farm at an inappropriate time after being offered `` pocket money '' , now making his return during winter looking like `` a miserable sight '' having `` changed '' .
