The temperature of the troposphere generally decreases as altitude increases . The rate at which the temperature decreases , âˆ’ d T / d z ( \ displaystyle - dT / dz ) , is called the environmental lapse rate ( ELR ) . The ELR is nothing more than the difference in temperature between the surface and the tropopause divided by the height . The ELR assumes that the air is perfectly still , i.e. that there is no mixing of the layers of air from vertical convection , nor winds that would create turbulence and hence mixing of the layers of air . The reason for this temperature difference is that the ground absorbs most of the sun 's energy , which then heats the lower levels of the atmosphere with which it is in contact . Meanwhile , the radiation of heat at the top of the atmosphere results in the cooling of that part of the atmosphere .
