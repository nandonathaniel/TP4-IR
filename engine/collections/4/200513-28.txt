Because state supreme courts generally hear only appeals , some courts have names which directly indicate their function -- in the states of New York and Maryland , and in the District of Columbia , the highest court is called the `` Court of Appeals '' . In New York , the `` Supreme Court '' is the trial court of general unlimited jurisdiction and the intermediate appellate court is called the `` Supreme Court -- Appellate Division '' . Maryland 's jury trial courts are called `` Circuit Courts '' ( non-jury trials are usually conducted by the `` District Courts , '' whose decisions may be appealed to the Circuit Courts ) , and the intermediate appellate court is called the `` Court of Special Appeals '' . West Virginia mixes the two ; its highest court is called the `` Supreme Court of Appeals '' .
