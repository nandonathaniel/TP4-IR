The ordering of the weekday names is not the classical order of the planets ( by distance in the planetary spheres model , or , equivalently , by their apparent speed of movement in the night sky ) . Instead , the planetary hours systems resulted in succeeding days being named for planets that are three places apart in their traditional listing . This characteristic was apparently discussed in Plutarch in a treatise written in c . AD 100 , which is reported to have addressed the question of Why are the days named after the planets reckoned in a different order from the actual order ? ( the text of Plutarch 's treatise has been lost ) .
