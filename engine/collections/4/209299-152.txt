By February 1945 , Speer was working to supply areas about to be occupied with food and materials to get them through the hard times ahead . On March 19 , 1945 , Hitler issued his Nero Decree , ordering a scorched earth policy in both Germany and the occupied territories . Hitler 's order , by its terms , deprived Speer of any power to interfere with the decree , and Speer went to confront Hitler , reiterating that the war was lost . Hitler gave Speer 24 hours to reconsider his position , and when the two met the following day , Speer answered , `` I stand unconditionally behind you . '' However , he demanded the exclusive power to implement the Nero Decree , and Hitler signed an order to that effect . Using this order , Speer worked to persuade generals and Gauleiters to circumvent the Nero Decree and avoid needless sacrifice of personnel and destruction of industry that would be needed after the war .
