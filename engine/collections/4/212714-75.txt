At the rich end of the scale the manor houses and palaces were awash with large , elaborately prepared meals , usually for many people and often accompanied by entertainment . The upper classes often celebrated religious festivals , weddings , alliances and the whims of the king or queen . Feasts were commonly used to commemorate the `` procession '' of the crowned heads of state in the summer months , when the king or queen would travel through a circuit of other nobles ' lands both to avoid the plague season of London , and alleviate the royal coffers , often drained through the winter to provide for the needs of the royal family and court . This would include a few days or even a week of feasting in each noble 's home , who depending on his or her production and display of fashion , generosity and entertainment , could have his way made in court and elevate his or her status for months or even years .
