The Department of Homeland Security has the power through the Real ID Act of 2005 to set standards relating to identification of applicants and license design for state - issued driver licenses and identification cards . States are not required to comply with RealID , but if a state does not comply , any driver licenses or ID cards issued by that state will not be valid for any official purpose with the federal government , meaning they will not be accepted for entering federal buildings or boarding airplanes .
