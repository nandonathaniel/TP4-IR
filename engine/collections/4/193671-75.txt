The difference between clock pendulums and gravimeter pendulums is that to measure gravity , the pendulum 's length as well as its period has to be measured . The period of freeswinging pendulums could be found to great precision by comparing their swing with a precision clock that had been adjusted to keep correct time by the passage of stars overhead . In the early measurements , a weight on a cord was suspended in front of the clock pendulum , and its length adjusted until the two pendulums swung in exact synchronism . Then the length of the cord was measured . From the length and the period , g could be calculated from equation ( 1 ) .
