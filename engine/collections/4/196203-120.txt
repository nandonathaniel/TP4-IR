In 1868 , the Grito de Lares took place , in which revolutionaries occupied the town of Lares and declared the Republic of Puerto Rico . Ramón Emeterio Betances was the leader of this revolt . Earlier , Segundo Ruiz Belvis and Betances had founded the Comité Revolucionario de Puerto Rico ( Revolutionary Committee of Puerto Rico ) from their exile in the Dominican Republic . Betances wrote several Proclamas , or statements attacking the exploitation of the Puerto Ricans by the Spanish colonial system , and called for immediate insurrection . These statements were rapidly circulated throughout the island as local dissident groups began to organize .
