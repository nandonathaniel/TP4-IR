States do not require reporting from their school districts to allow analysis of efficiency of return on investment . The Center for American Progress commends Florida and Texas as the only two states that provide annual school - level productivity evaluations which report to the public how well school funds are being spent at the local level . This allows for comparison of school districts within a state . In 2010 , American students rank 17th in the world . The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development says that this is due to focusing on the low end of performers . All of the recent gains have been made , deliberately , at the low end of the socioeconomic scale and among the lowest achievers . The country has been outrun , the study says , by other nations because the US has not done enough to encourage the highest achievers .
