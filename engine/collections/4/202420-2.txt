The majority of civil service positions are classified as competitive service , meaning employees are selected based on merit after a competitive hiring process for positions that are open to all applicants . The Senior Executive Service ( SES ) is the classification for non-competitive , senior leadership positions filled by career employees or political appointments ( e.g. , Cabinet members , ambassadors , etc . ) . Excepted service positions ( also known as unclassified service ) are non-competitive jobs in certain federal agencies with security and intelligence functions ( e.g. , the CIA , FBI , State Department , etc . ) that are authorized to create their own hiring policies and are not subject to most appointment , pay , and classification laws .
