The Royal Proclamation of 1763 established First Nation treaty rights , created the Province of Quebec out of New France , and annexed Cape Breton Island to Nova Scotia . St. John 's Island ( now Prince Edward Island ) became a separate colony in 1769 . To avert conflict in Quebec , the British Parliament passed the Quebec Act of 1774 , expanding Quebec 's territory to the Great Lakes and Ohio Valley . More importantly , the Quebec Act afforded Quebec special autonomy and rights of self - administration at a time that the Thirteen Colonies were increasingly agitating against British rule . It re-established the French language , Catholic faith , and French civil law there , staving off the growth of an independence movement in contrast to the Thirteen Colonies . The Proclamation and the Quebec Act in turn angered many residents of the Thirteen Colonies , further fuelling anti-British sentiment in the years prior to the American Revolution .
