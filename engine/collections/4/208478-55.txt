The earliest heart - shaped charges in heraldry appear in the 12th century ; the hearts in the coat of arms of Denmark go back to the royal banner of the kings of Denmark , in turn based on a seal used as early as the 1190s . However , while the charges are clearly heart - shaped , they did not in origin depict hearts , or symbolize any idea related to love . Instead they are assumed to have depicted the leaves of the water - lily . Early heraldic heart - shaped charges depicting the leaves of water - lilies are found in various other designs related to territories close to rivers or a coastline ( e.g. Flags of Frisia ) .
