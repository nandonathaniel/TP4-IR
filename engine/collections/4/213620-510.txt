Where English - speaking countries use different units for the same quantity , provide a conversion in parentheses : the Mississippi River is 2,320 miles ( 3,734 km ) long ; the Murray River is 2,508 kilometres ( 1,558 mi ) long . In science - related articles , however , supplying such conversion is not required unless there is some special reason to do so .
