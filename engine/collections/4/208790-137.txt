One month later , the proposed European Treaty was rejected not only by supporters of the EDC but also by Western opponents of the European Defence Community ( like French Gaullist leader Palewski ) who perceived it as `` unacceptable in its present form because it excludes the USA from participation in the collective security system in Europe '' . The Soviets then decided to make a new proposal to the governments of the USA , UK and France to accept the participation of the USA in the proposed General European Agreement . And considering that another argument deployed against the Soviet proposal was that it was perceived by Western powers as `` directed against the North Atlantic Pact and its liquidation '' , the Soviets decided to declare their `` readiness to examine jointly with other interested parties the question of the participation of the USSR in the North Atlantic bloc '' , specifying that `` the admittance of the USA into the General European Agreement should not be conditional on the three Western powers agreeing to the USSR joining the North Atlantic Pact '' .
