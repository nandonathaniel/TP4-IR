The IRSSA also included the Independent Assessment Process ( IAP ) , a case - by - case , out - of - court resolution process designed to provide compensation for sexual , physical and emotional abuse . The IAP process was built on the ADR program and all IAP claims from former students are examined by an Adjudicator . The IAP became available to all former students of residential schools on September 19 , 2007 . Former students who experienced abuse and wished to pursue compensation had to apply by themselves or through a lawyer of their choice to receive consideration . The deadline to apply for the IAP was September 19 , 2012 . This gave former students of residential schools four years from the implementation date of the IRSSA to apply for the IAP . Claims involving physical and sexual abuse were compensated up to $275,000 . By the end of January 2017 , the IAP had resolved 36,538 claims and paid $3.1 billion in compensation .
