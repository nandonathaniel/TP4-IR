In some parts of India , such as Gujarat and northern India , a laja homa ritual called mangal pherā is performed where the couple make four circles around holy fire . It follows hasta milap ( meeting of hands of the couple ) , but precedes Saptpadi . The first three circles is led by the groom , and it represents three of four goals of life considered important in Hindu life -- Dharma , Artha , Kama . The fourth circle is led by bride and it represents the fourth goal of life -- Moksha . After Saptapadi , as hymns are being recited , the groom performs māņg sindoor ritual where a saffron or red color powder is marked into the parting of the wife 's hair . Instead of circling the fire and other steps , the rituals and ceremonies may be performed symbolically , such as stepping on small heaps of rice or throwing grains into the fire .
