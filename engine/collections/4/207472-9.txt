Beakers are commonly made of glass ( today usually borosilicate glass ) , but can also be in metal ( such as stainless steel or aluminium ) or certain plastics ( notably polythene , polypropylene , PTFE ) . A common use for polypropylene beakers is gamma spectral analysis of liquid and solid samples .
