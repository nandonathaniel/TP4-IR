Two oxides of germanium are known : germanium dioxide ( GeO , germania ) and germanium monoxide , ( GeO ) . The dioxide , GeO can be obtained by roasting germanium disulfide ( GeS ) , and is a white powder that is only slightly soluble in water but reacts with alkalis to form germanates . The monoxide , germanous oxide , can be obtained by the high temperature reaction of GeO with Ge metal . The dioxide ( and the related oxides and germanates ) exhibits the unusual property of having a high refractive index for visible light , but transparency to infrared light . Bismuth germanate , Bi Ge O , ( BGO ) is used as a scintillator .
