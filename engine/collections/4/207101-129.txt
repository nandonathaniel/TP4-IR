The word serf originated from the Middle French serf and was derived from the Latin servus ( `` slave '' ) . In Late Antiquity and most of the Middle Ages , what are now called serfs were usually designated in Latin as coloni . As slavery gradually disappeared and the legal status of servi became nearly identical to that of the coloni , the term changed meaning into the modern concept of `` serf '' . Serfdom was coined in 1850 .
