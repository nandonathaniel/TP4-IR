Since Jackson had hit a home run off Dodger pitcher Don Sutton in his last at bat in Game Five , his three home runs in Game Six meant that he had hit four home runs on four consecutive swings of the bat against as many Dodgers pitchers . Jackson became the first player to win the World Series MVP award for two teams . In 27 World Series games , he amassed 10 home runs , including a record five during the 1977 Series ( the last three on first pitches ) , 24 RBI and a . 357 batting average . Babe Ruth , Albert Pujols , and Pablo Sandoval are the only other players to hit three home runs in a single World Series game . Babe Ruth accomplishing the feat twice -- in 1926 and 1928 ( both in Game Four ) . With 25 total bases , Jackson also broke Ruth 's record of 22 in the latter Series ; this remains a World Series record , Willie Stargell tying it in the 1979 World Series . Chase Utley ( 2009 , Philadelphia ) and George Springer ( 2017 , Houston ) have since tied Jackson 's record for most home runs in a single World Series .
