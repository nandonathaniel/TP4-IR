Many psalms ( 116 of the 150 ) have individual superscriptions ( titles ) , ranging from lengthy comments to a single word . Over a third appear to be musical directions , addressed to the `` leader '' or `` choirmaster '' , including such statements as `` with stringed instruments '' and `` according to lilies . '' Others appear to be references to types of musical composition , such as `` A psalm '' and `` Song '' , or directions regarding the occasion for using the psalm ( `` On the dedication of the temple '' , `` For the memorial offering '' , etc . ) . Many superscriptions carry the names of individuals , the most common ( 73 psalms - 75 if including the two Psalms attributed by the New Testament to being Davidic ) being of David , and thirteen of these relate explicitly to incidents in the king 's life . Others named include Asaph ( 12 ) , the Sons of Korah ( 11 ) , Solomon ( 2 ) , Moses ( 1 ) , Ethan the Ezrahite ( 1 ) , and Heman the Ezrahite ( 1 ) .
