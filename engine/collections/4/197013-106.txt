The opening section of `` Hold On '' , released as the group 's first single , was an a cappella version of the song 's first verse . Once the ladies reach the line `` and I wonder / who 's lovin ' you '' , a drum machine kicks in and starts a new jack swing beat , over which `` Hold On '' is delivered . `` Hold On '' was the anchor of En Vogue 's first album , Born to Sing , which eventually went platinum .
