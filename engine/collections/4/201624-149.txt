For the program 's first 25 years , weather reports were delivered by the host or newsreader . Dave Garroway illustrated the day 's forecast by drawing fronts and areas of precipitation on a big chalkboard map of the United States , based on information gathered earlier in the morning from the U.S. Weather Bureau in Washington , D.C. Subsequent hosts John Chancellor and Hugh Downs dropped the chalkboard weather map concept , and instead read a prepared weather summary over a still image of a weather map . When the show converted to all - color broadcasts in 1965 , weather maps were prepared and projected on a screen behind Frank Blair , who delivered the forecast immediately after his news summaries . Following Blair 's retirement on March 14 , 1975 , Lew Wood took over the newsreader and weather reporting duties . When Floyd Kalber was brought in as newsreader in 1976 , Wood was relegated to weather , sports , roving reporter assignments , and presenting live on - air commercials until his departure in 1978 .
