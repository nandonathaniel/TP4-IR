The Rojava cantons are governed through a combination of district and civil councils . District councils consist of 300 members as well as two elected co-presidents - one man and one woman . District councils decide and carry out administrative and economic duties such as garbage collection , land distribution and cooperative enterprises . Civil councils exist to promote social and political rights in the community .
