In 1964 , cellulose acetate , the material used to create Lego bricks , was replaced by the more stable acrylonitrile butadiene styrene ( ABS plastic ) , which is still used today . ABS is non-toxic , is less prone to discolouration and warping , and is more resistant to heat , acids , salt , and other chemicals . Samsonite manufacturing in North America did not switch at the same time , and still used some degree of cellulose acetate in its Lego products .
