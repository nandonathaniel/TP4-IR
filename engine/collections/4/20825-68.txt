In general relativity , energy -- momentum conservation is not well - defined except in certain special cases . Energy - momentum is typically expressed with the aid of a stress -- energy -- momentum pseudotensor . However , since pseudotensors are not tensors , they do not transform cleanly between reference frames . If the metric under consideration is static ( that is , does not change with time ) or asymptotically flat ( that is , at an infinite distance away spacetime looks empty ) , then energy conservation holds without major pitfalls . In practice , some metrics such as the Friedmann -- Lema√Ætre -- Robertson -- Walker metric do not satisfy these constraints and energy conservation is not well defined . The theory of general relativity leaves open the question of whether there is a conservation of energy for the entire universe .
