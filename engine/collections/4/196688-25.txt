Another way to increase the yield of the reaction would be to remove the product ( i.e. ammonia gas ) from the system . In practice , gaseous ammonia is not removed from the reactor itself , since the temperature is too high ; it is removed from the equilibrium mixture of gases leaving the reaction vessel . The hot gases are cooled enough , whilst maintaining a high pressure , for the ammonia to condense and be removed as liquid . Unreacted hydrogen and nitrogen gases are then returned to the reaction vessel to undergo further reaction .
