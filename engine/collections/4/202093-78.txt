The Enterprise engine room was redesigned while keeping consistent with the theory that the interior appearance had to match the corresponding area visible in exterior views of the starship . Michelson wanted the engine room to seem vast , a difficult effect to achieve on a small sound stage . To create the illusion of depth and long visible distances , the art department staff worked on designs that would utilize forced perspective ; set designer Lewis Splittgerber considered the engine room the most difficult set to realize . On film the engine room appeared hundreds of feet long , but the set was actually only 40 feet ( 12 m ) in length . To achieve the proper look , the floor slanted upward and narrowed , while small actors of three , four , and five feet in height were used as extras to give the appearance of being far from the camera . For `` down shots '' of the engineering complex , floor paintings extended the length of the warp core several stories . J.C. Backings Company created these paintings ; similar backings were used to extend the length of ship hallways and the rec room set .
