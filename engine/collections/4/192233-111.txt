Los Angeles Times ' Kenneth Turan , who felt the film began slowly , stated that the `` story , psychology and reality , not special effects '' , assisted the darkness behind Batman 's arsenal ; he noted that Neeson and Holmes , unlike Bale 's ability to `` feel his role in his bones '' , do not appear to fit their respective characters in `` being both comic - book archetypes and real people '' . The New Yorker 's David Denby did not share Berardinelli and Turan 's opinion . He was unimpressed with the film , when comparing it to the two Tim Burton films , and that Christian Bale 's presence was hindered by the `` dull earnestness of the screenplay '' , the final climax was `` cheesy and unexciting '' , and that Nolan had resorted to imitating the `` fakery '' used by other filmmakers when filming action sequences .
