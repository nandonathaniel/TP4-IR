The climatic deterioration which culminated in the Last Glacial Maximum , between about 26,500 and 19,000 -- 20,000 years ago , drove humans out of Britain , and there is no evidence of occupation for around 18,000 years after c. 33,000 years BP . Sites such as Cathole Cave in Swansea County dated at 14,500 BP , Creswell Crags in Nottinghamshire at 12,800 BP and Gough 's Cave in Somerset 12,000 years BP , provide evidence suggesting that humans returned to Britain towards the end of this ice age during a warm period from 14,700 to 12,900 years BP ago ( the Bølling - Allerød interstadial known as the Windermere Interstadial in Britain ) , although further extremes of cold right before the final thaw may have caused them to leave again and then return repeatedly . The environment during this ice age period would have been a largely treeless tundra , eventually replaced by a gradually warmer climate , perhaps reaching 17 degrees Celsius ( 62.6 Fahrenheit ) in summer , encouraging the expansion of birch trees as well as shrub and grasses .
