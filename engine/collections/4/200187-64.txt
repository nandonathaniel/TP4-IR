Smith intended to establish the New Jerusalem in North America , called Zion . In 1831 , the church moved to Kirtland , Ohio ( the eastern boundary of Zion ) , and began establishing an outpost in Jackson County , Missouri ( Zion 's `` center place '' ) , where he planned to eventually move the church headquarters . However , in 1833 , Missouri settlers brutally expelled the Latter Day Saints from Jackson County , and the church was unable via a paramilitary expedition to recover the land . Nevertheless , the church flourished in Kirtland as Smith published new revelations and the church built the Kirtland Temple , culminating in a dedication of the building similar to the day of Pentecost . The Kirtland era ended in 1838 , after a financial scandal rocked the church and caused widespread defections. Smith regrouped with the remaining church in Far West , Missouri , but tensions soon escalated into violent conflicts with the old Missouri settlers . Believing the Saints to be in insurrection , the Missouri governor ordered that the Saints be `` exterminated or driven from the State . '' In 1839 , the Saints converted a swampland on the banks of the Mississippi River into Nauvoo , Illinois , which became the church 's new headquarters .
