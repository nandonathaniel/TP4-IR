A number turned to orthodox Marxism - Leninism . At some time between 1949 and 1951 , Pol Pot and Ieng Sary joined the French Communist Party . In 1951 , the two men went to East Berlin to participate in a youth festival . This experience is considered to have been a turning point in their ideological development . Meeting with Khmers who were fighting with the Viet Minh ( and whom they subsequently judged to be too subservient to the Vietnamese ) , they became convinced that only a tightly disciplined party organization and a readiness for armed struggle could achieve revolution . They transformed the Khmer Students Association ( KSA ) , to which most of the 200 or so Khmer students in Paris belonged , into an organization for nationalist and leftist ideas .
