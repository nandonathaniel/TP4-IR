At the height of their fame in 1967 , they also suffered from a media backlash . Nesmith states in the 2007 Rhino reissue of Pisces , Aquarius , Capricorn & Jones Ltd. , `` Everybody in the press and in the hippie movement had got us into their target window as being illegitimate and not worthy of consideration as a musical force ( or ) certainly any kind of cultural force . We were under siege ; wherever we went there was such resentment for us . We were constantly mocked and humiliated by the press . We were really gettin ' beat up pretty good . We all knew what was going on inside . Kirshner had been purged . We 'd gone to try to make Headquarters and found out that it was only marginally okay and that our better move was to just go back to the original songwriting and song - making strategy of the first albums except with a clear indication of how ( the music ) came to be ... The rabid element and the hatred that was engendered is almost impossible to describe . It lingers to this day among people my own age . '' Tork disagreed with Nesmith 's assessment of Headquarters , stating , `` I do n't think the Pisces album was as groovy to listen to as Headquarters . Technically it was much better , but I think it suffers for that reason . ''
