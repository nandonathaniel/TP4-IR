Although the grave under Mound 14 had been destroyed almost completely by robbing , apparently during a heavy rainstorm , it had contained exceptionally high - quality goods belonging to a woman . These included a chatelaine , a kidney - shaped purse - lid , a bowl , several buckles , a dress - fastener , and the hinges of a casket , all made of silver , and also a fragment of embroidered cloth .
