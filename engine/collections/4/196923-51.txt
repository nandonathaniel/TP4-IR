Dogon art is primarily sculpture . Dogon art revolves around religious values , ideals , and freedoms ( Laude , 19 ) . Dogon sculptures are not made to be seen publicly , and are commonly hidden from the public eye within the houses of families , sanctuaries , or kept with the Hogon ( Laude , 20 ) . The importance of secrecy is due to the symbolic meaning behind the pieces and the process by which they are made .
