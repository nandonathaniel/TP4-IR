Though these regions are in practice administered by their respective claimants , neither India nor Pakistan has formally recognised the accession of the areas claimed by the other . India claims those areas , including the area `` ceded '' to China by Pakistan in the Trans - Karakoram Tract in 1963 , are a part of its territory , while Pakistan claims the entire region excluding Aksai Chin and Trans - Karakoram Tract . The two countries have fought several declared wars over the territory . The Indo - Pakistani War of 1947 established the rough boundaries of today , with Pakistan holding roughly one - third of Kashmir , and India one - half , with a dividing line of control established by the United Nations . The Indo - Pakistani War of 1965 resulted in a stalemate and a UN-negotiated ceasefire .
