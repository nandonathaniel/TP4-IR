Amenhotep II , the son of Thutmose III , who became a co-regent toward the end of his father 's reign , is suspected by some as being the defacer during the end of the reign of a very old pharaoh . He would have had a motive because his position in the royal lineage was not so strong as to assure his elevation to pharaoh . He is documented , further , as having usurped many of Hatshepsut 's accomplishments during his own reign . His reign is marked with attempts to break the royal lineage as well , not recording the names of his queens and eliminating the powerful titles and official roles of royal women , such as God 's Wife of Amun .
