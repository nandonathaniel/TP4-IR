The war had set in motion profound social changes within Britain , and had ultimately led to a widespread popular desire for social reform . This mood was epitomised in the Beveridge Report of 1942 , by the Liberal economist William Beveridge . The Report assumed that the maintenance of full employment would be the aim of post-war governments , and that this would provide the basis for the welfare state . Immediately on its release , it sold hundreds of thousands of copies . All major parties committed themselves to fulfilling this aim , but most historians say that Attlee 's Labour Party were seen by the electorate as the most likely to follow it through .
