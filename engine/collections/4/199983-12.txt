Unlike some other sports game companies , EA Sports has no special ties to a single platform , which means that all games are released for the best - selling active platforms , sometimes long after most of the other companies abandon them . For example , FIFA 98 , Madden NFL 98 , NBA Live 98 , and NHL 98 were released for the Sega Genesis and the Super NES throughout 1997 ; Madden NFL 2005 and FIFA 2005 had PlayStation released in 2004 ( FIFA 2005 was also the last PlayStation title to be released ) ; and NCAA Football 08 had an Xbox released in 2007 . Madden NFL 08 also had Xbox and Nintendo GameCube releases in 2007 , and was the final title released for the GameCube , with Madden NFL 09 following as the final Xbox title . Additionally , NASCAR Thunder 2003 and NASCAR Thunder 2004 were released not only for the PlayStation 2 , but for the original PlayStation as well . EA Sports brand name is used to sponsor English Football League One team Swindon Town F.C. from the 2009 -- 10 season onward and the EA Sports Cup in the Republic of Ireland .
