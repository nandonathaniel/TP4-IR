The earliest known reference to the phrase `` hair of the dog '' in connection with drunkenness is found in a text from ancient Ugarit dating from the mid to late second millennium BC , in which the god Ê¾Ilu becomes hungover after a drinking binge . The text includes a recipe for a salve to be applied to the god 's forehead , which consists of `` hairs of a dog '' and parts of an unknown plant mixed with olive oil .
