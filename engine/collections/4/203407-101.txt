The Rankine cycle is sometimes referred to as a practical Carnot cycle because , when an efficient turbine is used , the TS diagram begins to resemble the Carnot cycle . The main difference is that heat addition ( in the boiler ) and rejection ( in the condenser ) are isobaric ( constant pressure ) processes in the Rankine cycle and isothermal ( constant temperature ) processes in the theoretical Carnot cycle . In this cycle a pump is used to pressurize the working fluid which is received from the condenser as a liquid not as a gas . Pumping the working fluid in liquid form during the cycle requires a small fraction of the energy to transport it compared to the energy needed to compress the working fluid in gaseous form in a compressor ( as in the Carnot cycle ) . The cycle of a reciprocating steam engine differs from that of turbines because of condensation and re-evaporation occurring in the cylinder or in the steam inlet passages .
