Britain 's close relationship with the two Hashemite kingdoms of Iraq and Jordan were of particular concern to Nasser . In particular , Iraq 's increasingly amicable relations with Britain were a threat to Nasser 's desire to see Egypt as head of the Arab world .

Nasser 's response was a series of challenges to British influence in the region that would culminate in the Suez Crisis .
