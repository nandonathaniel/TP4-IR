`` Forty - five seconds after the beginning of the injection , heaviness of the eyelids and transitory diplopia were perceived . At the completion of the injection , diplopia became fixed , but could be noticed only when the subject 's eyelids were raised by the operator . As curarization proceeded , it seemed to the subject as if the facial muscles , those of the tongue , pharynx , and lower jaw , the muscles of the neck and back , and the muscles of the extremities became relaxed in about that order . Accompanying the paralysis of the pharynx and the jaw muscles , inability of the subject to swallow was noted ... Shortly after the injection was completed the subjects experienced a sensation of increased difficulty in breathing , as if an extra effort was necessary to maintain an adequate respiratory exchange . This sensation was present even though there was no objective evidence of impaired oxygenation or of carbon dioxide retention . It reached its maximum about five minutes after the injection , coinciding with the maximum depression of the vital capacity . In the majority of the experiments the respiratory rate was increased by about 50 -- 100 per cent the first minutes after the injection of any one of the drugs while the tidal volume decreased . ''
