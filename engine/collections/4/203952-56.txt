The A811 runs to the south of Loch Lomond between Balloch and Drymen , following the route of another military road at a distance of between 2 and 3 kilometres from the loch . From Drymen the B837 extends north , meeting the eastern shore of the loch at Balmaha where the road terminates . A minor road extends north as far as Rowardennan , a further 11 km away , however beyond this point no road continues along the eastern shore , although there is road access to Inversnaid via another minor road that comes in from Loch Katrine to the east via the northern shore of Loch Arklet . As Loch Arklet is over 100 m above Loch Lomond and less than 2 km to the east this road must descend steeply to reach Inversnaid .
