When Weaver did not appear in court on February 20 , Judge Ryan issued a bench warrant for failure to appear in court . On February 26 , Ken Keller , a reporter for the Kootenai Valley Times , telephoned the U.S. Probation Office and asked whether the reason that Weaver did not show in court on February 20 was that the letter sent to him by Richins had the incorrect date . Upon finding a copy of the letter , the Chief Probation Officer , Terrence Hummel , contacted Judge Ryan 's clerk and informed them of the incorrect date in the letter . Hummel also contacted the U.S. Marshals Service and Weaver 's attorney informing them of the error . The judge , however , refused to withdraw the bench warrant .
