Hawaiian eruptions often begin as a line of vent eruptions along a fissure vent , a so - called `` curtain of fire . '' These die down as the lava begins to concentrate at a few of the vents . Central - vent eruptions , meanwhile , often take the form of large lava fountains ( both continuous and sporadic ) , which can reach heights of hundreds of meters or more . The particles from lava fountains usually cool in the air before hitting the ground , resulting in the accumulation of cindery scoria fragments ; however , when the air is especially thick with clasts , they can not cool off fast enough due to the surrounding heat , and hit the ground still hot , the accumulation of which forms spatter cones . If eruptive rates are high enough , they may even form splatter - fed lava flows . Hawaiian eruptions are often extremely long lived ; Puʻu ʻŌʻō , a cinder cone of Kilauea , has been erupting continuously since 1983 . Another Hawaiian volcanic feature is the formation of active lava lakes , self - maintaining pools of raw lava with a thin crust of semi-cooled rock ; there are currently only 6 such lakes in the world , and the one at Kīlauea 's Kupaianaha vent is one of them .
