In 1846 the Indian soldiers of the Corps of Guides in British India began to wear a yellowish shade of tan , which became known as khaki from the Urdu word for dust - colored , taken from an earlier Persian word for soil . The color made an excellent natural camouflage , and was adopted by the British Army for their Abyssian Campaign in 1867 -- 1868 , and later in the Boer War . It was adopted by the United States Army during the Spanish -- American War ( 1896 ) , and afterwards by the United States Navy and United States Marine Corps .
