Ancient Greek , ancient Roman and medieval philosophers usually combined the geocentric model with a spherical Earth . It is not the same as the older flat Earth model implied in some mythology . The ancient Jewish Babylonian uranography pictured a flat Earth with a dome - shaped , rigid canopy called the firmament placed over it ( רקיע - rāqîa ' ) . However , the ancient Greeks believed that the motions of the planets were circular and not elliptical , a view that was not challenged in Western culture until the 17th century through the synthesis of theories by Copernicus and Kepler .
