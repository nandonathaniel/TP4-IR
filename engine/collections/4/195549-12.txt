In non-flowering seed plants , pollen germinates in the pollen chamber , located beneath the micropyle , underneath the integuments of the ovule . A pollen tube is produced , which grows into the nucellus to provide nutrients for the developing sperm cells . Sperm cells of Pinophyta and Gnetophyta are without flagella , and are carried by the pollen tube , while those of Cycadophyta and Ginkgophyta have many flagella .
