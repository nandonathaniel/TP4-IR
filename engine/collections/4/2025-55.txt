Until 1767 , the East India Company paid an ad valorem tax of about 25 % on tea that it imported into Great Britain . Parliament laid additional taxes on tea sold for consumption in Britain . These high taxes , combined with the fact that tea imported into the Dutch Republic was not taxed by the Dutch government , meant that Britons and British Americans could buy smuggled Dutch tea at much cheaper prices . The biggest market for illicit tea was England -- by the 1760s the East India Company was losing Â£ 400,000 per year to smugglers in Great Britain -- but Dutch tea was also smuggled into British America in significant quantities .
