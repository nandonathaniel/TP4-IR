On March 5 , 2012 , a federal judge ruled in Woollard v Sheridan that Maryland 's `` may issue '' concealed carry law is unconstitutional , writing , `` A citizen may not be required to offer a ' good and substantial reason ' why he should be permitted to exercise his rights . '' The Maryland Attorney General 's office appealed the ruling . On March 21 , 2013 , a three judge panel of the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals ( U.S. Federal ) unanimously overturned the District Court ruling , holding that the `` good & substantial cause '' requirements imposed by Maryland law are permissible without violating the 2nd Amendment .
