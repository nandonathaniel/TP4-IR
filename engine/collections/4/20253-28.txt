When the first Congress assembled 4 March 1789 , the administration felt the need of a paper , and , under the influence of Hamilton , John Fenno issued at New York , 15 April , the first number of The Gazette of the United States , the earliest of a series of administration organs . The editorship of the Gazette later fell to Joseph Dennie , who had previously made a success of The Farmer 's Weekly Museum and would later found Port Folio , two of the most successful newspapers of the era . The seat of government became the journalistic center of the country , and as long as party politics remained the staple news interest the administration organs and their opponents were the chief sources of news for the papers of the country .
