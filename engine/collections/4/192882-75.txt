Cleveland , like a growing number of Northerners ( and nearly all white Southerners ) saw Reconstruction as a failed experiment , and was reluctant to use federal power to enforce the 15th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution , which guaranteed voting rights to African Americans . Though Cleveland appointed no black Americans to patronage jobs , he allowed Frederick Douglass to continue in his post as recorder of deeds in Washington , D.C. and appointed another black man ( James Campbell Matthews , a former New York judge ) to replace Douglass upon his resignation . His decision to replace Douglass with a black man was met with outrage , but Cleveland claimed to have known Matthews personally .
