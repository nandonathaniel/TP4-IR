The modern breed is descended from a number of breeding programs of white terriers in Scotland before the 20th century . Cousin to the Cairn Terrier , the Westie was bred to hunt small rodents at places such as farms . Edward Donald Malcolm , 16th Laird of Poltalloch , is credited with the creation of the modern breed from his Poltalloch Terrier , but did not want to be known as such .
