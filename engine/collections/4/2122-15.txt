Benjamin Franklin proposed a form of daylight time in 1784 . His essay , `` An Economical Project for Diminishing the Cost of Light '' , written to the editor of The Journal of Paris , observed that Parisians could save on candles by getting out of bed earlier in the morning , making use of the natural morning light instead . Franklin 's suggestion seems to have been more of a joke than a real proposal , and nothing came of it .
