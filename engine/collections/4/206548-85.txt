A bishop is the president of the Aaronic priesthood in his ward ( and is thus a form of Mormon Kohen ; in fact , a literal descendant of Aaron has `` legal right '' to act as a Bishop after being found worthy and ordained by the First Presidency ) . In the absence of a literal descendant of Aaron , a High priest in the Melchizedek priesthood is called to be a Bishop . Each bishop is selected from resident members of the ward by the stake presidency with approval of the First Presidency , and chooses two counselors to form a bishopric . In special circumstances ( such as a ward consisting entirely of young university students ) , a bishop may be chosen from outside the ward . A bishop is typically released after about five years and a new bishop is called to the position . Although the former bishop is released from his duties , he continues to hold the Aaronic priesthood office of Bishop . Church members frequently refer to a former bishop as `` Bishop '' as a sign of respect and affection .
