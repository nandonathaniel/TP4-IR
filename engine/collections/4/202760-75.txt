Some U.S. states and cities extend similar honors . For example , in the state of Hawaii , three people have been laid in state at the Hawaii State Capitol , among which include famous Hawaiian singer Israel Kamakawiwo ªole upon his death in 1997 , and the aforementioned Daniel Inouye , President pro tempore of the U.S. Senate and Senator from Hawaii .
