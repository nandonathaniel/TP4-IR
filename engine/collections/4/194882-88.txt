Some individuals have difficulty crossing bridges , a phenomenon known as gephyrophobia . The Mackinac Bridge Authority has a Drivers Assistance Program that provides drivers for those with gephyrphobia , or anyone who is more comfortable having someone else drive them across . More than a thousand people use this service every year . Those interested can arrange , either by phone or with the toll collector , to have their cars or motorcycles driven to the other end . There is no additional fee for this service . Bicycles and pedestrians are not normally permitted on the bridge . An exception is allowed for riders of two annual bicycle tours . On an everyday basis , for a $5.00 fee , the Authority will transport bicyclists and their vehicles across the bridge .
