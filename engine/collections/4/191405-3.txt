Letter case is generally applied in a mixed - case fashion , with both upper - and lower - case letters appearing in a given piece of text . The choice of case is often prescribed by the grammar of a language or by the conventions of a particular discipline . In orthography , the upper case is primarily reserved for special purposes , such as the first letter of a sentence or of a proper noun , which makes the lower case the more common variant in regular text . In some contexts , it is conventional to use one case only . For example , engineering design drawings are typically labelled entirely in upper - case letters , which are easier to distinguish than the lower case , especially when space restrictions require that the lettering be small . In mathematics , on the other hand , letter case may indicate the relationship between objects , with upper - case letters often representing `` superior '' objects ( e.g. X could be a set containing the generic member x ) .
