Advocates of school corporal punishment argue that it provides an immediate response to indiscipline and that the student is quickly back in the classroom learning , as opposed to suspension from school . Opponents , including a number of medical and psychological societies , along with human - rights groups , argue that physical punishment is ineffective in the long term , interferes with learning , leads to antisocial behavior as well as various forms of mental distress , disproportionately affects students of color , and is a form of violence that breaches the rights of children .
