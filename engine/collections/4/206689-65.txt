Beginning an effort to rebuild the team with new and young talent , the Islanders selected John Tavares with the first - overall pick of the 2009 NHL Entry Draft . Tavares went into the draft as the top prospect in the majority of scouting reports , and it was widely expected that the Islanders would select him after they secured the first overall pick by winning the draft lottery , although there was plenty of competition between Tavares , Victor Hedman , and Matt Duchene . NHL Central Scouting Bureau 's Chris Edwards spoke highly of him , stating , `` ( Tavares ) is phenomenal at getting the puck through traffic to his linemates , getting to opening . The way he reads the play and can get to where he figures the rebounds will be and bangs in the rebound . He 's a real smart player . '' They traded up twice in the first round to also select defenseman Calvin de Haan with the 12th overall pick , as well as Casey Cizikas and Anders Lee in later rounds , all of whom would go on to play consistently on the main roster by the 2014 -- 15 season .
