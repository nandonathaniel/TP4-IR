Regarding Murray 's portrayal of the character , Paul Cooke of DVDActive.com said , `` Murray does a fine job as a brooding Lucas . '' Kelsey Zukowsk of 2snaps.tv said , `` Chad Michael Murray as Lucas plays one of the deeper roles ... ( He ) does far better as Lucas , the one who seems to be motivated by truth and what is right , than any movie role I have seen him in . '' Television Without Pity , on the other hand , stated , `` Chad Michael Murray is almost too pretty , looks good pouting on promo posters and modeling sponsored fashions , and can only muster one and a half emotions convincingly .
