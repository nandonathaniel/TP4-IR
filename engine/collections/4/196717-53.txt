Most universities and colleges usually run from early September until the end of April or early May . Often , this winter session is split into two terms running September to December and January to April . Various forms of summer studies may be offered May to August . Some , such as University of Waterloo and Simon Fraser University , run a full tri-semester system , providing full courses during summer . There are a few school boards in Canada experimenting with year - round schooling .
