In 1964 , Israeli physician Jacob Sheskin administered thalidomide to a patient critically ill with leprosy . The patient exhibited erythema nodosum leprosum ( ENL ) , a painful skin condition , one of the complications of leprosy . This was attempted despite the ban on thalidomide 's use , but results were favourable : the patient slept for hours and was able to get out of bed without aid upon awakening . A clinical trial studying the use of thalidomide in leprosy soon followed .
