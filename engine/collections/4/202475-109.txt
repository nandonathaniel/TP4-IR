Secondary intention is implemented when primary intention is not possible . This is due to wounds being created by major trauma in which there has been a significant loss in tissue or tissue damage . The wound is allowed to granulate . Surgeon may pack the wound with a gauze or use a drainage system . Granulation results in a broader scar . Healing process can be slow due to presence of drainage from infection . Wound care must be performed daily to encourage wound debris removal to allow for granulation tissue formation . Using antibiotics or antiseptics for the surgical wound healing by secondary intention is controversial . Examples : gingivectomy , gingivoplasty , tooth extraction sockets , poorly reduced fractures , burns , severe lacerations , pressure ulcers .
