The defeat of France in June 1940 introduced the prospect for the first time of independent air action against Britain . A July Fliegercorps I paper asserted that Germany was by definition an air power : `` Its chief weapon against England is the Air Force , then the Navy , followed by the landing forces and the Army . '' In 1940 , the Luftwaffe would undertake a `` strategic offensive ... on its own and independent of the other services '' , according to an April 1944 German account of their military mission . GÃ¶ring was convinced that strategic bombing could win objectives which were beyond the army and navy , and gain political advantages in the Third Reich for the Luftwaffe and himself . He expected air warfare to decisively force Britain to negotiate , as all in the OKW hoped , and the Luftwaffe took little interest to planning to support an invasion .
