In the case of bacterial infection , the bacterium becomes trapped in already - clogged sinuses , breeding in the moist , nutrient - rich environment . Sinusitis is an uncomfortable condition which may include congestion of mucus . A bacterial infection in sinusitis will cause discolored mucus and would respond to antibiotic treatment ; viral infections typically resolve without treatment . Almost all sinusitis infections are viral and antibiotics are ineffective and not recommended for treating typical cases .
