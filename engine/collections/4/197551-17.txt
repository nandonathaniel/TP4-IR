There are many oxbow lakes alongside the Mississippi River and its tributaries . The largest oxbow lake in North America , Lake Chicot ( located near Lake Village , Arkansas ) , was originally part of the Mississippi River , as was Horseshoe Lake , the namesake for the town of Horseshoe Lake , Arkansas . Reelfoot Lake in west Tennessee is another notable oxbow lake ; it was formed when the Mississippi River took a new channel following the 1811 -- 12 New Madrid earthquakes .
