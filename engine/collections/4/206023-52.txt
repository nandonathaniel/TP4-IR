In 2016 , DC Comics once again relaunched all of its publications as part of the `` DC Rebirth '' continuity reboot , which has a new bi-monthly Wonder Woman series from writer Greg Rucka . The new series does not use a regular storyline that exists between each issue ; instead two separate storylines share the book , with an installment of one story published every other issue , and those of the other storyline published in between those . This practice began with the storyline `` The Lies '' for the odd numbered issues , and `` Year One '' for the even numbered issues . The new storyline as presented in these issues effectively retcons the events from the previous New 52 series . `` The Lies '' storyline reveals that a number of events from the previous Wonder Woman series in which Diana was made the Queen of the Amazons and the God of War , was in fact all an illusion created by a mysterious villain , and she had never once been back to Themyscira ever since she left , nor is she capable of returning there . The `` Year One '' story is presented as an all - new origin story for Diana , which reveals how she received her powers from the Olympian Gods , which was intended to bring her back to her classical DC roots . Wonder Woman appears in DC Rebirth with a revised look , which includes a red cape and light armor fittings . Along with her lasso and bracelets , she now regularly utilizes her sword and shield . Wonder Woman : Rebirth artist Liam Sharp described the new armor as a utilitarian piece which allows her to move more freely .
