There have been different approaches to co-educational Scouting . Countries such as the United States have maintained separate Scouting organizations for boys and girls . In other countries , especially within Europe , Scouting and Guiding have merged , and there is a single organization for boys and girls , which is a member of both the WOSM and the WAGGGS . In others , such as Australia and the United Kingdom , the national Scout association has opted to admit both boys and girls , but is only a member of the WOSM , while the national Guide association has remained as a separate movement and member of the WAGGGS . In some countries like Greece , Slovenia and Spain there are separate associations of Scouts ( members of WOSM ) and guides ( members of WAGGGS ) , both admitting boys and girls .
