The Himalayan population belongs to four distinct cultural groups , who throughout history have systematically penetrated the isolated indigenous Himalayan population . Those migrating cultures -- Hindu ( Indian ) , Buddhist ( Tibetan ) , Islamic ( Afghanistan -- Iran ) and Animist ( Burmese and south - eastern Asian ) -- without any doubt have created here their own individual and unique place . Their current arrangement , though with a few exceptions , is linked to specific geographical regions , and the relative altitude at which they occur .
