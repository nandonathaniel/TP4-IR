On 13 July 2007 , the Zimbabwean government said that it had temporarily stopped publishing ( official ) inflation figures , a move that observers said was meant to draw attention away from `` runaway inflation which has come to symbolise the country 's unprecedented economic meltdown '' . In 2008 , the inflation rate accelerated dramatically , from a rate in January of over 100,000 % to an estimated rate of over one million percent by May , and nearly 250,000,000 % in July . As predicted by the quantity theory of money , this hyperinflation was linked to the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe 's choice to mushroom the money supply .
