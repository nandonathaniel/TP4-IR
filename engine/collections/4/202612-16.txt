If the water potential ( or strictly , water vapour potential ) inside a leaf is higher than outside , the water vapour will diffuse out of the leaf down this gradient . This loss of water vapour from the leaves is called transpiration , and the water vapour diffuses through the open stomata . Transpiration is natural and inevitable for plants , and much water is lost through this process . However , it is vital that plants living in dry conditions are adapted so as to reduce this water loss and decrease the size of the open stomata , in order to reduce unnecessary loss from the plant . It is important for a plant living in these conditions to conserve water because , without enough water , plant cells lose turgor . This is known as plasmolysis . If the plant loses too much water , it will pass its permanent wilting point , and die .
