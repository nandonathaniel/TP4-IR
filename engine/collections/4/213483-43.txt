Although Napoleon promised more than he ever intended to deliver to the Polish cause , in 1807 he created a Duchy of Warsaw from Prussian territory that had been part of old Poland and was still inhabited by Poles . Basically a French puppet , the duchy did enjoy some degree of self - government , and many Poles believed that further Napoleonic victories would bring restoration of the entire commonwealth .
