In 409 Olympius fell to further intrigue , having his ears cut off before he was beaten to death . Alaric tried again to negotiate with Honorius , but his demands ( now even more moderate , only frontier land and food ) were inflated by the messenger and Honorius responded with insults , which were reported verbatim to Alaric . He broke off negotiations and the standoff continued . Honorius 's court made overtures to the usurper Constantine III in Gaul and arranged to bring Hunnic forces into Italy , Alaric ravaged Italy outside the fortified cities ( which he could not garrison ) , and the Romans refused open battle ( for which they had inadequate forces ) . Late in the year Alaric sent bishops to express his readiness to leave Italy if Honorius would only grant his people a supply of grain . Honorius , sensing weakness , flatly refused .
