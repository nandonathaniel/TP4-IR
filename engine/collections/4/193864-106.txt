The 2012 film The Amazing Spider - Man , shows Parker using artificial web - shooters mounted on the exterior of Spider - Man 's gloves . The webbing is an Oscorp product called `` biocable '' which is made from the webbing of genetically engineered spiders . Peter buys boxes of biocable cartridges and incorporates them into old wrist watches with a palm - mounted sensor as a trigger . However , unlike the comics , where Peter must steadily replenish his webbing supply , in the movie , Peter never showed any problem with his web - shooters running out of ammo , except when his web - shooters are broken .
