In matters pertaining to non-financial ( ordinary ) bills , after the bill has been passed by the House where it was originally tabled ( Lok Sabha or Rajya Sabha ) , it is sent to the other house , where it may be kept for a maximum period of 6 months . If the other House rejects the bill or a period of 6 months elapses without any action by that House , or the House that originally tabled the bill does not accept the recommendations made by the members of the other house , it results in a deadlock . This is resolved by a joint session of both Houses , presided over by the speaker of the Lok Sabha and decided by a simple majority . Though the Constitution has placed both houses on the same footing in this regard , in reality it is the Lok Sabha 's opinions that mostly prevails -- due to its bigger numerical strength .
