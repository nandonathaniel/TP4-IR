In 1956 , Kurien visited Nestle in their home country , on the commerce and industries minister 's concern to ask them to bring down imported inputs of their Indian production and have more Indians inducted , but they told him that making condensed milk `` could not be left to the natives '' . He stormed out of that meeting after giving them an earful , came back and ramped up Amul 's production & market of condensed milk , and after two years got the government to ban the import of condensed milk into the country . Amul faced serious competition from imported butter , especially from New Zealand . The then finance minister came to trust Kurien so much , that whenever Kurien would ask him to cut imports of butter it would be done every time , in tandem with a mere promise of an incremental increase of his production to make good any shortage . And every single time he kept his word and the markets never faced any shortage of butter . During the 1962 Indo - China war , the government depended on Kurien to step up supplies to the army . He had to divert these away from his civilian market . When Polson sensed an undue advantage in this and started grabbing his market share , Kurien was blunt to him and made sure the government froze Polson 's production lines , as part of the war effort .
