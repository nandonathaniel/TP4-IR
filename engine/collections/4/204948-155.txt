Congregationalists set up missionary societies to evangelize the western territory of the northern tier . Members of these groups acted as apostles for the faith , and also as educators and exponents of northeastern urban culture . The Second Great Awakening served as an `` organizing process '' that created `` a religious and educational infrastructure '' across the western frontier that encompassed social networks , a religious journalism that provided mass communication , and church - related colleges . Publication and education societies promoted Christian education ; most notable among them was the American Bible Society , founded in 1816 . Women made up a large part of these voluntary societies . The Female Missionary Society and the Maternal Association , both active in Utica , NY , were highly organized and financially sophisticated women 's organizations responsible for many of the evangelical converts of the New York frontier .
