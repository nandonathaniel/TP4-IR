Parliamentary immunity , also known as legislative immunity , is a system in which members of the parliament or legislature are granted partial immunity from prosecution . Before prosecuting , it is necessary that the immunity be removed , usually by a superior court of justice or by the parliament itself . This reduces the possibility of pressing a member of the parliament to change his or her vote by fear of prosecution .
