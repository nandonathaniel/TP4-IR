Several sea urchins , however , including the sand dollars , are oval in shape , with distinct front and rear ends , giving them a degree of bilateral symmetry . In these urchins , the upper surface of the body is slightly domed , but the underside is flat , while the sides are devoid of tube feet . This `` irregular '' body form has evolved to allow the animals to burrow through sand or other soft materials .
