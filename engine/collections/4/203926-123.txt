Some iwi sided with the government and , later , fought with the government . They were motivated partly by the thought that an alliance with the government would benefit them , and partly by old feuds with the iwi they fought against . One result of their co-operation strategy was the establishment of the four Māori electorates in the House of Representatives , in 1867 .
