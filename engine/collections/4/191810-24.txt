The number of deaf people in South Africa ( 600,000 deaf and 1.4 million people with hearing loss ) does not give an accurate depiction of the number of people who communicate in South African Sign Language . There is currently no estimate for the number of people who communicate in South African Sign Language in South Africa . Estimates vary greatly , from 700,000 to 2 million users . A request was made to the Human Sciences Research Council ( South Africa ) to measure this as part of the 2011 census .
