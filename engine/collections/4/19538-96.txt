Major Anderson held his fire , awaiting daylight . His troops reported for a call at 6 a.m. and then had breakfast . At 7 a.m. , Capt . Abner Doubleday fired a shot at the Ironclad Battery at Cummings Point . He missed . Given the available manpower , Anderson could not take advantage of all of his 60 guns . He deliberately avoided using guns that were situated in the fort where casualties were most likely . The fort 's best cannons were mounted on the uppermost of its three tiers -- the barbette tier -- where his troops were most exposed to incoming fire from overhead . The fort had been designed to withstand a naval assault , and naval warships of the time did not mount guns capable of elevating to shoot over the walls of the fort . However , the land - based cannons manned by the Confederates were capable of high - arcing ballistic trajectories and could therefore fire at parts of the fort that would have been out of naval guns ' reach . Fort Sumter 's garrison could only safely fire the 21 working guns on the lowest level , which themselves , because of the limited elevation allowed by their embrasures , were largely incapable of delivering fire with trajectories high enough to seriously threaten Fort Moultrie . Moreover , although the Federals had moved as many of their supplies to Fort Sumter as they could manage , the fort was quite low on ammunition , and was nearly out at the end of the 34 - hour bombardment . A more immediate problem was the scarcity of cloth gunpowder cartridges or bags ; only 700 were available at the beginning of the battle and workmen sewed frantically to create more , in some cases using socks from Anderson 's personal wardrobe . Because of the shortages , Anderson reduced his firing to only six guns : two aimed at Cummings Point , two at Fort Moultrie , and two at the Sullivan 's Island batteries .
