Halas and Shaughnessy had created a revolutionary concept with the T - formation offense . The complex spins , turns , fakes , and all around athletic versatility required to execute the scheme limited the possible players available . Halas believed he 'd found the perfect quarterback for his new offense in Sid Luckman , a passing star at Columbia University . Luckman was a single wing tailback ; the tailback is the primary runner and passer in that scheme . Luckman launched his Hall of Fame career playing quarterback for the Bears from 1939 to 1950 . Halas was not satisfied with other players who succeeded Luckman under center . During this coaching stint , he had on the Bears roster two future Hall of Fame players , Bobby Layne in 1948 and George Blanda from 1949 to 1958 .

Blanda played in the NFL until 1975 ; Bratkowski moved on to Vince Lombardi 's Green Bay Packers from 1960 to 1971 ; and Bobby Layne quarterbacked the Detroit Lions to three NFL championship games between 1952 -- 54 , winning two .
