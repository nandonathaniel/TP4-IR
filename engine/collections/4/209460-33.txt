Categorically stating the number of islands is difficult , as the method used to determine what is an island is not necessarily the same in each source . Since the water level of the lake can vary greatly between years , what may be considered an island in a high water year may be considered a peninsula in another , or an island in a low water year may be covered during another year . According to the U.S. Department of the Interior and the U.S. Geological Survey , `` there are eight named islands in the lake that have never been totally submerged during historic time . All have been connected to the mainland by exposed shoals during periods of low water . '' In addition to these eight islands , the lake also contains a number of rocks , reefs , or shoals that become fully or partially submerged at high water levels .
