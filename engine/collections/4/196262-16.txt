Heat in the atmosphere leads to melting of glaciers and sea ice , a decrease in the extent of snow cover , and shifts from snowfall to rainfall . Melting of glacier ice and snow contribute to SLR , whereas melting sea ice does not directly contribute to sea - level rise because it already displaces its own mass in the oceans . However , as sea ice retreats , more dark open water is exposed to absorb heat from the atmosphere and from the Sun , contributing to heating of the Arctic and Antarctic and further encouraging SLR . According to scientists from the National Snow and Ice Data Center in Boulder retreating ice cover in the Arctic Ocean , long held to be an early warning of warming climate , shattered the all - time low record in the summer of 2007 , and nearly matched it again in 2008 .
