In his flight from the lieutenant and his posse , the priest escapes into a neighbouring province , only to re-connect with the mestizo , who persuades the priest to return to hear the confession of a dying man . Though the priest suspects that it is a trap , he feels compelled to fulfil his priestly duty . Although he finds the dying man , it is a trap and the lieutenant captures the priest . The lieutenant admits he has nothing against the priest as a man , but he must be shot `` as a danger '' . On the eve of the execution , the lieutenant shows mercy and attempts to enlist Padre José to hear the condemned man 's confession , but the effort is thwarted by Padre José 's wife . The lieutenant is convinced that he has `` cleared the province of priests '' . In the final scene , however , another priest arrives in the town -- which , among other possible readings , suggests that the Catholic Church can not be destroyed .
