with F the net force ( a vector ) , m the mass of a particle and a the acceleration of the particle ( also a vector ) which would be measured by an observer at rest in the frame . The force F is the vector sum of all `` real '' forces on the particle , such as electromagnetic , gravitational , nuclear and so forth . In contrast , Newton 's second law in a rotating frame of reference , rotating at angular rate Î© about an axis , takes the form :
