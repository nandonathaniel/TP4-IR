In Columbus , Ohio , Wade Watts , an orphaned 17 - year - old Gunter , lives with his aunt Alice in the `` stacks '' , makeshift towers of trailer homes , and logs onto the OASIS from a nearby cargo van . His avatar Parzival , and his online friend Aech , a male first - person shooter expert and virtual mechanic , participate in the first quest : a vehicle race across ever - shifting roadways in Manhattan . Parzival saves and befriends a well - known Gunter named Art3mis from being `` zeroed '' by King Kong , which would have wiped her character progression . At Anorak 's virtual archives containing video clips reconstructing Halliday 's life , Parzival gets an insight from a comment that Halliday made to his former business partner , Ogden Morrow , and on the next race , uncovers an underground short cut to the finish line to acquire the first key . Aech and Art3mis , as well as players Daito and Sho , soon follow ; appearing atop the global scoreboard as the `` High Five '' .
