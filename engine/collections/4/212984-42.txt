After failing to make progress on the flanks -- the Dutch on the left , Brigadier Ingolsby 's brigade on the right -- Cumberland decided to smash his way through the centre without securing the flanks of his main attack . Despite devastating flanking fire the allied column , made up of British and Hanoverian infantry , burst through the French lines to the point of victory . Only when Saxe concentrated all available infantry , cavalry , and artillery was the column forced to yield . The allies retreated in good order , conducting a fighting withdrawal . The battle had shown , however , the strength of a defensive force relying on firepower and a strong reserve .
