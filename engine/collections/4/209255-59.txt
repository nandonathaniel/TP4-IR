In 50 BC , the Senate ( led by Pompey ) ordered Caesar to disband his army and return to Rome because his term as governor had finished . Caesar thought he would be prosecuted if he entered Rome without the immunity enjoyed by a magistrate . Pompey accused Caesar of insubordination and treason . On January 10 , 49 BC , Caesar crossed the Rubicon river ( the frontier boundary of Italy ) with only a single legion , the Legio XIII Gemina , and ignited civil war . Upon crossing the Rubicon , Caesar , according to Plutarch and Suetonius , is supposed to have quoted the Athenian playwright Menander , in Greek , `` the die is cast '' . Erasmus , however , notes that the more accurate Latin translation of the Greek imperative mood would be `` alea iacta esto '' , let the die be cast . Pompey and many of the Senate fled to the south , having little confidence in Pompey 's newly raised troops . Pompey , despite greatly outnumbering Caesar , who only had his Thirteenth Legion with him , did not intend to fight . Caesar pursued Pompey , hoping to capture Pompey before his legions could escape .
