By 2010 , China reportedly signed a civil nuclear agreement with Pakistan , using the justification that the deal was `` peaceful . '' The British government criticized this , on the grounds that ' the time is not yet right for a civil nuclear deal with Pakistan ' . China did not seek formal approval from the nuclear suppliers group , and claimed instead that its cooperation with Pakistan was `` grandfathered '' when China joined the NSG , a claim that was disputed by other NSG members . Pakistan applied for membership on 19 May 2016 , supported by Turkey and China . However , many NSG members opposed Pakistan 's membership bid due to its track record , including the illicit procurement network of Pakistani scientist A.Q. Khan , which aided the nuclear programs of Iran , Libya and North Korea . Pakistani officials reiterated the request in August 2016 .
