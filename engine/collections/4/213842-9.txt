In the vi family of text editors , escape is used to switch modes . This usage is due to escape being conveniently placed in what is now the tab position on the ADM - 3A terminal keyboard used to develop vi , though it is now inconveniently placed . This is similar to how the extensive modifier keys in Emacs were easily used on the original keyboard ( the space - cadet keyboard ) , being placed together , but these keys have now been spread around the keyboard , becoming more difficult to use .
