Take action immediately upon hearing thunder . Anyone close enough to the storm to hear thunder can be struck by lightning . Avoid electrical appliances , including corded telephones . Cordless and wireless telephones are safe to use during a thunderstorm . Close and stay away from windows and doors , as glass can become a serious hazard in high wind . Do not bathe or shower , as plumbing conducts electricity . If driving , safely exit the roadway , turn on hazard lights , and park . Remain in the vehicle and avoid touching metal .
