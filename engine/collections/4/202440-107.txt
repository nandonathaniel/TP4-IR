The US West Coast is a critical migratory corridor for the Pacific loggerheads , in which these turtles swim across the Pacific to California 's coast from breeding grounds in Japan . Important foraging habitats for juveniles in the central North Pacific have been revealed through telemetry studies . Along with these foraging habitats , high levels of bycatch from industrial - scale fisheries have been found to overlap ; with drift gillnets in the past and longline fisheries presently . Many juvenile loggerheads aggregate off the coast of Baja California Sur , Mexico , where small coastal fisheries increase these turtles ' mortality risk ; fishers have reported catching dozens of loggerheads with bottom - set gear per day per boat . The most common commercial fishery that accidentally takes loggerheads are bottom trawls used for shrimp vessels in the Gulf of California . In 2000 , between 2,600 and 6,000 loggerheads were estimated to have been killed by pelagic longlining in the Pacific .
