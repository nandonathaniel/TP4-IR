At the end of Victor 's narrative , Captain Walton resumes the telling of the story , closing the frame around Victor 's recounting . A few days after the Creature vanished , the ship becomes trapped in pack ice and multiple crewmen die in the cold , before the rest of Walton 's crew insists on returning south once it is freed . Upon hearing the crew 's pleas to their captain , Victor , angered , lectures them with a powerful speech : it is hardship , not comfort and easiness , that defines a glorious undertaking such as theirs ; he urges them to be men , not cowards . The ship is freed and Walton , owing it to the will of his men , albeit regretfully , decides to return South . Victor , even though in very weak condition , states that he will go on by himself .
