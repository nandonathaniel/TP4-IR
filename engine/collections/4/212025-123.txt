Blacksmith fish live in loose shoals . They have a symbiotic relationship with the parasite eating senorita fish . When they encounter a shoal of senorita fish , they stop and form a tight ball and hang upside down ( pictured ) , each fish waiting its turn to be cleaned . The senorita fish pick dead tissues and external parasites , like parasitic copecods and isocods , from the skin of other fishes .
