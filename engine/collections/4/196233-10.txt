The Hyundai Santa Fe ( Korean : 현대 싼타페 ) is a sport utility vehicle ( SUV ) produced by the South Korean manufacturer Hyundai since 2000 . It is named after the city of Santa Fe , New Mexico , and was introduced for the 2001 model year as Hyundai 's first SUV , released at the same time as the Ford Escape and Pontiac Aztek . The Santa Fe was a milestone in the company 's restructuring program of the late 1990s because , despite receiving criticism from journalists for its obscure looks , the SUV was a hit with American buyers . The SUV was so popular that at times , Hyundai had trouble supplying the demand . The Santa Fe quickly became Hyundai 's best seller and contributed to Hyundai 's success in the United States . As of 2007 , the Santa Fe falls between the slightly smaller compact crossover Tucson and the larger , yet related luxury crossover SUV Veracruz ( which replaced the Terracan ) .
