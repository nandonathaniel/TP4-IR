Of all the planets in the Solar System , the seasons of Mars are the most Earth - like , due to the similar tilts of the two planets ' rotational axes . The lengths of the Martian seasons are about twice those of Earth 's because Mars 's greater distance from the Sun leads to the Martian year being about two Earth years long . Martian surface temperatures vary from lows of about − 143 ° C ( − 225 ° F ) at the winter polar caps to highs of up to 35 ° C ( 95 ° F ) in equatorial summer . The wide range in temperatures is due to the thin atmosphere which can not store much solar heat , the low atmospheric pressure , and the low thermal inertia of Martian soil . The planet is 1.52 times as far from the Sun as Earth , resulting in just 43 % of the amount of sunlight .
