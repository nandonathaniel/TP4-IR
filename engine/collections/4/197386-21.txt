Mako is also described as being outspoken , generally not afraid to share his opinions with others . He 's also characterized as smart and a dedicated worker who at times puts his career before anything else . Additionally , Mako is very guarded in his dealings with strangers , lacking the naivety of his brother . For roughly 1 / 2 of the series ' run , Mako wore a signature red scarf that was once his father San 's , who was murdered along with his mother when he was eight years old .
