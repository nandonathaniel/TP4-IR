The Bundestag ( Federal Diet ) is elected for a four - year term and consists of 598 or more members elected by a means of mixed - member proportional representation , which Germans call `` personalised proportional representation . '' 299 members represent single - seat constituencies and are elected by a first past the post electoral system . Parties that obtain fewer constituency seats than their national share of the vote are allotted seats from party lists to make up the difference . In contrast , parties that obtain more constituency seats than their national share of the vote are allowed to keep these so - called overhang seats . In the parliament that was elected in 2009 , there were 24 overhang seats , giving the Bundestag a total of 622 members . After Bundestag elections since 2013 , other parties obtain extra seats ( `` balance seats '' ) that offset advantages from their rival 's overhang seats . The current Bundestag is the largest in German history with 709 parliament members .
