The great depth of the Grand Canyon and especially the height of its strata ( most of which formed below sea level ) can be attributed to 5 -- 10 thousand feet ( 1,500 to 3,000 m ) of uplift of the Colorado Plateau , starting about 65 million years ago ( during the Laramide Orogeny ) . This uplift has steepened the stream gradient of the Colorado River and its tributaries , which in turn has increased their speed and thus their ability to cut through rock ( see the elevation summary of the Colorado River for present conditions ) .
