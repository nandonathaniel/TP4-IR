After its independence in 1947 , Pakistani law was fairly liberal regarding liquor laws . Major cities had a culture of drinking , and alcohol was readily available until the 1970s when prohibition was introduced for Muslim citizens . Since then , Pakistan 's majority Muslim population has been unable to legally buy alcohol , and advertising for alcoholic beverages has been outlawed . However it remains widely available in urban Pakistan through bootleggers and also through the diplomatic staff of some minor countries .
