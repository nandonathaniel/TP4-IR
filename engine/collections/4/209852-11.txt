For the implementation and achievement of the UNICA Internationalisation and Mobility goals , the international relations officers ( IROs ) from member universities play a main role . IROs meet at least once a year to discuss UNICA approaches , initiatives and policies in the field of higher education . Projects and collaboration in member universities are developed within UNICA working groups .
