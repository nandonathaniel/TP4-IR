The `` Fender Bass '' was a revolutionary new instrument for gigging musicians . In comparison with the large , heavy upright bass , which had been the main bass instrument in popular music , folk and country music from the early 1900s to the 1940s , the Fender bass could be easily transported to shows . The bass guitar was also less prone to unwanted feedback sounds when amplified , than acoustic bass instruments . In 1953 Monk Montgomery became the first bass player to tour with the Fender bass guitar , in Lionel Hampton 's postwar big band . Roy Johnson , and Shifty Henry with Louis Jordan & His Tympany Five , were other early Fender bass pioneers . Bill Black , playing with Elvis Presley , switched from upright bass to the Fender Precision Bass around 1957 . The bass guitar was intended to appeal to guitarists as well as upright bass players , and many early pioneers of the instrument , such as Carol Kaye and Joe Osborn , were originally guitarists .
