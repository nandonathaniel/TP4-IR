The role of an assistant director on a film includes tracking daily progress against the filming production schedule , arranging logistics , preparing daily call sheets , checking cast and crew , and maintaining order on the set . They also have to take care of the health and safety of the crew . The role of an assistant to the director is often confused with assistant director but the responsibilities are entirely different . The assistant to the director manages all of the Director 's in development , pre-production , while on set , through post-production and is often involved in both personal management as well as creative aspects of the production process . Historically , assistant to director was a stepping stone to directing work ; Alfred Hitchcock was an AD , as was James McTeigue . This transition into film directing is no longer common in feature films . It is more common now for an assistant to the director to transition to a production management or producer role than to directing .
