Printmaking is the process of making artworks by printing , normally on paper . Printmaking normally covers only the process of creating prints that have an element of originality , rather than just being a photographic reproduction of a painting . Except in the case of monotyping , the process is capable of producing multiples of the same piece , which is called a print . Each print produced is not considered a `` copy '' but rather is considered an `` original '' . This is because typically each print varies to an extent due to variables intrinsic to the printmaking process , and also because the imagery of a print is typically not simply a reproduction of another work but rather is often a unique image designed from the start to be expressed in a particular printmaking technique . A print may be known as an impression . Printmaking ( other than monotyping ) is not chosen only for its ability to produce multiple impressions , but rather for the unique qualities that each of the printmaking processes lends itself to .
