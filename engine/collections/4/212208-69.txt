For the Hydra , Scarfe provided preliminary drawings to give the mythical beast its requisite fangs and serpentine necks before work was transferred over to the computer animation team headed by Roger Gould . The Hydra was sculpted into a clay model where the dimensions was digitized into the computers into a wire - frame model by which the monster was animated . Early into production , the filmmakers decided the Hydra would ultimately have thirty heads by which the animators created one master head , and the computer could multiply the heads to their desired scale . Overall , thirteen animators and technical directors spent nearly a year - and - a-half creating the four - minute battle sequence . Additionally , because the directors envisioned Olympus as a city composed of clouds , painted backgrounds of clouds and cloud - like imagery were blended with drawn effects animation to create a morphing technique that were used for baby Hercules 's cradle and Zeus 's reclining chair .
