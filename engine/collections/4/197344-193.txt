When General MacArthur returned to the Philippines with his army in late 1944 , he was well supplied with information ; it is said that by the time MacArthur returned , he knew what every Japanese lieutenant ate for breakfast and where he had his hair cut . But the return was not easy . The Japanese Imperial General Staff decided to make the Philippines their final line of defense , and to stop the American advance toward Japan . They sent every available soldier , airplane , and naval vessel to the defense of the Philippines . The Kamikaze corps was created specifically to defend the Philippines . The Battle of Leyte Gulf ended in disaster for the Japanese and was the biggest naval battle of World War II . The campaign to re-take the Philippines was the bloodiest campaign of the Pacific War . Intelligence information gathered by the guerrillas averted a disaster -- they revealed the plans of Japanese General Yamashita to trap MacArthur 's army , and they led the liberating soldiers to the Japanese fortifications .
