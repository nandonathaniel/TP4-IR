Puerto Rico has been discussed as a potential 51st state of the United States . In a 2012 status referendum a majority of voters , 54 % , expressed dissatisfaction with the current political relationship . In a separate question , 61 % of voters supported statehood ( excluding the 26 % of voters who left this question blank ) . On December 11 , 2012 , Puerto Rico 's legislature resolved to request that the President and the U.S. Congress act on the results , end the current form of territorial status and begin the process of admitting Puerto Rico to the Union as a state . On January 4 , 2017 , Puerto Rico 's new representative to Congress pushed a bill that would ratify statehood by 2025 .
