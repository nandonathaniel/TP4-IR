A popular and enduring narrative of the Spanish campaign in central Mexico is by New England - born nineteenth - century historian William Hickling Prescott . His History of the Conquest of Mexico , first published in 1843 , remains an important unified narrative synthesis of the conquest . Prescott read and used all the formal writings from the sixteenth century , although few had been published by the mid-nineteenth century when he was writing . It is likely that a 1585 revision of Bernardino de Sahag√∫n 's account of the conquest survives today only in the form of a copy because it was made in Spain for Prescott 's project from a now - lost original . Although scholars of the modern era point out its biases and shortcomings , `` there is nowhere they can get as good a unified narrative of the main events , crises , and course of the Mexican conquest as Prescott 's version .
