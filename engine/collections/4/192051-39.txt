Sinatra began singing professionally as a teenager , but he learned music by ear and never learned to read music . He got his first break in 1935 when his mother persuaded a local singing group , the 3 Flashes , to let him join . Fred Tamburro , the group 's baritone , stated that `` Frank hung around us like we were gods or something '' , admitting that they only took him on board because he owned a car and could chauffeur the group around . Sinatra soon learned they were auditioning for the Major Bowes Amateur Hour show , and `` begged '' the group to let him in on the act . With Sinatra , the group became known as the Hoboken Four , and passed an audition from Edward Bowes to appear on the Major Bowes Amateur Hour show . They each earned $12.50 for the appearance , and ended up attracting 40,000 votes and won first prize -- a six - month contract to perform on stage and radio across the United States . Sinatra quickly became the group 's lead singer , and , much to the jealousy of his fellow group members , garnered most of the attention from girls . Due to the success of the group , Bowes kept asking for them to return , disguised under different names , varying from `` The Seacaucus Cockamamies '' to `` The Bayonne Bacalas '' .
