Constructed between 1894 and 1930 , the Nativity façade was the first façade to be completed . Dedicated to the birth of Jesus , it is decorated with scenes reminiscent of elements of life . Characteristic of Gaudí 's naturalistic style , the sculptures are ornately arranged and decorated with scenes and images from nature , each a symbol in its own manner . For instance , the three porticos are separated by two large columns , and at the base of each lies a turtle or a tortoise ( one to represent the land and the other the sea ; each are symbols of time as something set in stone and unchangeable ) . In contrast to the figures of turtles and their symbolism , two chameleons can be found at either side of the façade , and are symbolic of change .
