Biff Loman : Willy 's elder son . Biff was a football star with a lot of potential in high school , but failed math his senior year and dropped out of summer school when he saw Willy with another woman while visiting him in Boston . He wavers between going home to try to fulfill Willy 's dream for him as a businessman or ignoring his father by going out West to be a farmhand where he feels happy . He likes being outdoors and working with his hands , yet wants to do something worthwhile so Willy will be proud . Biff steals because he wants evidence of success , even if it is false evidence , but overall Biff remains a realist and informs Willy that he is just a normal guy and will not be a great man .
