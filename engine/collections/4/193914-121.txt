After the fall of Vicksburg in July 1863 , General Kirby Smith in Texas was informed by Jefferson Davis that he could expect no further help from east of the Mississippi River . Although he lacked resources to beat Union armies , he built up a formidable arsenal at Tyler , along with his own Kirby Smithdom economy , a virtual `` independent fiefdom '' in Texas , including railroad construction and international smuggling . The Union in turn did not directly engage him . Its 1864 Red River Campaign to take Shreveport , Louisiana was a failure and Texas remained in Confederate hands throughout the war .
