Following several years of unsuccessful negotiations , the conflict re-erupted as the Second Intifada on September 2000 . The violence , escalating into an open conflict between the Palestinian National Security Forces and the Israel Defense Forces , lasted until 2004 / 2005 and led to approximately 130 fatalities . In 2005 , Israeli Prime Minister Sharon ordered the removal of Israeli settlers and soldiers from Gaza . Israel and its Supreme Court formally declared an end to occupation , saying it `` had no effective control over what occurred '' in Gaza . However , the United Nations , Human Rights Watch and many other international bodies and NGOs continue to consider Israel to be the occupying power of the Gaza Strip as Israel controls Gaza Strip 's airspace , territorial waters and controls the movement of people or goods in or out of Gaza by air or sea .
