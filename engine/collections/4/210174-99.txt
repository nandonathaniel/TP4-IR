Although Ertegun subsequently disputed Kalodner 's account of the Genesis / Collins contract saga , he agreed that the loss of Gabriel was a big mistake , and his regret about his handling of the matter was only compounded by Gabriel 's subsequent success with Geffen . Much of this was due to Kalodner , who later admitted that , as soon as Gabriel was dropped from Atlantic , he realised he had made a mistake . In order to make amends to Gabriel , he alerted both CBS and Geffen to the fact that Gabriel was available , and after a bidding war , Gabriel signed with Geffen . They released his fourth solo album ( a.k.a. `` Security '' ) in 1984 to wide acclaim , and Gabriel scored a minor US hit with the single `` Shock The Monkey '' . Atlantic 's regret was undoubtedly heightened when Gabriel achieved huge international success with his fifth album So ( 1986 ) , which reached # 1 in the UK and # 2 in the US and sold more than 5 million copies in the US . The irony was further compounded by the fact that Gabriel scored a US # 1 hit with the R&B - influenced single `` Sledgehammer '' , which featured the legendary Memphis Horns , and which Gabriel later described as `` my chance to sing like Otis Redding .
