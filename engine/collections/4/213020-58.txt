The Knights Radiant originated through spren copying the abilities which the heralds obtained through their Honorblades . The Knights Radiant gained their power through spren by creating a bond with them called the Nahel bond . The bond gives the spren sentience , while giving the human surgebinding abilities . Two examples are Sylphrena , an Honorspren , that shares a bond with Kaladin , giving him the power to Surgebind , and Shallan , who created a bond with Pattern , a Liespren ( Cryptic ) to Soulcast and create Illusions . The Knights Radiant lived by their order 's Five Ideals , called The Immortal Words , with the First Ideal being the same for every order : Life before death , strength before weakness , journey before destination . The other four ideals are different for each order , with the exception of the Order of the Lightweavers , having only the First Ideal . Towards the end of The Way of Kings , Kaladin utters the Second Ideal for the Order of Windrunners : `` I will protect those who can not protect themselves '' . Near the end of Words of Radiance , Kaladin whispers the Third Ideal for the Order of Windrunners : `` I will protect even those I hate , so long as it is right '' .
