During the debates at the Constitutional Convention , the Founding Fathers made a number of references to the concept of judicial review . The greatest number of these references occurred during the discussion of the proposal known as the Virginia Plan . The Virginia Plan included a `` council of revision '' that would have examined proposed new federal laws and would have accepted or rejected them , similar to today 's presidential veto . The `` council of revision '' would have included the President along with some federal judges . Several delegates objected to the inclusion of federal judges on the council of revision . They argued the federal judiciary , through its power to declare laws unconstitutional , already had the opportunity to protect against legislative encroachment , and the judiciary did not need a second way to negate laws by participating in the council of revision . For example , Elbridge Gerry said federal judges `` would have a sufficient check against encroachments on their own department by their exposition of the laws , which involved a power of deciding on their constitutionality . In some states the judges had actually set aside laws , as being against the constitution . This was done too with general approbation . '' Luther Martin said : `` ( A ) s to the constitutionality of laws , that point will come before the judges in their official character . In this character they have a negative on the laws . Join them with the executive in the revision , and they will have a double negative . '' These and other similar comments by the delegates indicated that the federal courts would have the power of judicial review .
