The most successful team in ODI cricket , in terms of win percentage ( barring the Asia XI cricket team who have only played seven games ) is South Africa , who overtook previous leaders Australia in 2017 , and as of 16 July 2018 have a record of 63.69 % . In contrast , three teams have failed to win a single ODI : East Africa , Namibia , and the USA , though they have only played eleven ODIs between them .
