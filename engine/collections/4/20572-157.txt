The 2014 Fatah -- Hamas Gaza Agreement provided for elections and the formation of a compromise unity government . The 2014 Israel - Gaza conflict intervened , however the unity government survived . In August , Palestinian leaders said they would apply to the United Nations Security Council for the establishment of a timetable for ending the Israeli occupation in the West Bank . The application would be made on 15 September 2014 , following an Arab League meeting on 5 September at which support for the move would be requested . Unless a timetable was established , the Palestinian leadership said it would apply to the International Criminal Court where it would hold Israel responsible for its actions not only in the West Bank , but in the Gaza Strip .
