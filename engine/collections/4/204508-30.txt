Despite the Mick Jackson original reaching a # 61 peak on the Billboard Hot 100 in September 1978 , Epic Records that month released the Jacksons ' version of `` Blame It on the Boogie '' as the advance single from the Destiny album . Although `` Blame It on the Boogie '' returned the Jacksons to the Hot 100 after five flop singles , it was not the single to effect a major comeback for the Jacksons , peaking at # 54 ; it would be the follow - up , `` Shake Your Body ( Down to the Ground ) '' , which would briefly restore the Jacksons ' Top Ten fortunes . However , `` Blame It on the Boogie '' did reach # 3 R&B and would be coupled with `` Shake Your Body ( Down to the Ground ) '' on an extended club play single which would reach # 20 on the dance charts in 1979 .
