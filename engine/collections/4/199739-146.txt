In 2013 it was revealed that up to 50 % of acts on the televised shows had been headhunted by producers . In 2012 , electropop band Superpowerless were approached to appear in the semi-finals . They attended the audition after assurances that the act would be portrayed in a positive light . On the day they felt that all interviews , especially those with Stephen Mulhern , were conducted in a manner intending to portray them in a negative light , reducing their act to a novelty / comedy routine intended for ridicule and humiliation . While many newspapers wrote articles on this topic , very few were published as the news outlets were told that running the story would cut that publication out of any advance coverage of the show in the future .
