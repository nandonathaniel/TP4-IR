On the return to Earth , a bearing at the Guam tracking station failed , potentially preventing communication on the last segment of the Earth return . A regular repair was not possible in the available time but the station director , Charles Force , had his ten - year - old son Greg use his small hands to reach into the housing and pack it with grease . Greg later was thanked by Armstrong .
