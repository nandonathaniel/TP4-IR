The Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution each contain a due process clause . Due process deals with the administration of justice and thus the due process clause acts as a safeguard from arbitrary denial of life , liberty , or property by the government outside the sanction of law . The Supreme Court of the United States interprets the clauses more broadly , concluding that these clauses provide four protections : procedural due process ( in civil and criminal proceedings ) , substantive due process , a prohibition against vague laws , and as the vehicle for the incorporation of the Bill of Rights .
