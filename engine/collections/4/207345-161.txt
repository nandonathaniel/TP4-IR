The movable type invented by Bi Sheng was ultimately trumped by the use of woodblock printing due to the limitations of the enormous Chinese character writing system , yet movable type printing continued to be used and was improved in later periods . The Yuan dynasty scholar - official Wang Zhen ( fl. 1290 -- 1333 ) implemented a faster typesetting process , improved Bi 's baked - clay movable type character set with a wooden one , and experimented with tin - metal movable type . The wealthy printing patron Hua Sui ( 1439 -- 1513 ) of the Ming dynasty established China 's first metal movable type ( using bronze ) in 1490 . In 1638 the Beijing Gazette switched their printing process from woodblock to movable type printing . Yet it was during the Qing dynasty that massive printing projects began to employ movable type printing . This includes the printing of sixty - six copies of a 5,020 volume long encyclopedia in 1725 , the Gujin Tushu Jicheng ( Complete Collection of Illustrations and Writings from the Earliest to Current Times ) , which necessitated the crafting of 250,000 movable type characters cast in bronze . By the 19th century the European style printing press replaced the old Chinese methods of movable type , while traditional woodblock printing in modern East Asia is used sparsely and for aesthetic reasons .
