Most of the area had been the Mexican territory of Alta California , while a southeastern strip on the Rio Grande had been part of Santa Fe de Nuevo Mexico , most of whose area and population were east of the Rio Grande on land that had been claimed by the Republic of Texas since 1835 , but never controlled or even approached aside from the Texan Santa Fe Expedition . Mexico controlled the territory later known as the Mexican Cession , with considerable local autonomy punctuated by several revolts and few troops sent from central Mexico , in the period from 1821 -- 22 after independence from Spain up through 1846 when U.S. military forces seized control of California and New Mexico on the outbreak of the Mexican -- American War . The northern boundary of the 42nd parallel north was set by the Adams -- On√≠s Treaty signed by the United States and Spain in 1821 and ratified by Mexico in 1831 . The eastern boundary of the Mexican Cession was the Texas claim at the Rio Grande and extending north from the headwaters of the Jojo Rivera , not corresponding to Mexican territorial boundaries . The southern boundary was set by the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo , which followed the Mexican boundaries between Alta California ( to the north ) and Baja California and Sonora ( to the south ) .
