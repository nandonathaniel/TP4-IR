The changes made to Liverpool 's tactics came to fruition during the 1972 -- 73 UEFA Cup . The club reached their second European final , where they faced Borussia Mönchengladbach of Germany . Liverpool won the first leg 3 -- 0 as a result of two goals from Kevin Keegan and one from Larry Lloyd . Victory in this first leg meant Liverpool only needed to avoid losing by three or more goals in order to win the final . This influenced their tactics -- The Times reported that Liverpool employed a `` holding action '' against the `` attacking Germans '' . The tactics worked , allowing Mönchengladbach only two goals , granting Liverpool a 3 -- 2 aggregate victory . Liverpool also won the First Division championship that season , and as a result qualified for the 1973 -- 74 European Cup , where they were eliminated in the second round by Red Star Belgrade of Yugoslavia . At the end of that season , Shankly retired .
