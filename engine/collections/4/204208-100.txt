The persistent insistence was that the channel was contractually required to keep the word `` Family '' in its name -- a situation that would have required any of its succeeding owners to negotiate out of such a clause or create an entirely new network over Fox / ABC Family 's channel space , effectively cancelling all of the channel 's existing carriage contracts , without any obligation by cable and satellite providers to put the replacement service in the channel slot vacated by Fox Family . Audience testing conducted by the network revealed that some infrequent viewers thought the channel was still aimed specifically at families was what resulted in Disney -- ABC 's decision to rebrand the channel as Freeform . Network president Ascheim refuted the longstanding claim regarding the inclusion of `` Family '' in the name , and acknowledged the network 's shift away from a strictly family - oriented focus in the years leading up to the name change .
