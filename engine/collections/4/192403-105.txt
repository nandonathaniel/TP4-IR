Studies of the prevalence of personality disorders ( PDs ) have been fewer and smaller - scale , but one broad Norwegian survey found a five - year prevalence of almost 1 in 7 ( 13.4 % ) . Rates for specific disorders ranged from 0.8 % to 2.8 % , differing across countries , and by gender , educational level and other factors . A US survey that incidentally screened for personality disorder found a rate of 14.79 % .
