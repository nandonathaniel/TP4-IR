Each state was allowed to cast a single vote either for or against a proposal during the debates in accordance with the majority opinion of the state 's delegates . Throughout the Convention , delegates would regularly come and go , with only 30 -- 40 being present on a typical day . Consequently , if a state 's delegates were equally divided in their views on a given proposal , or if too few of the state 's delegates were in attendance to establish a quorum for the delegation when votes were being cast on a particular proposal , that state 's delegation had essentially no effect on the outcome of the vote on the proposal . Thus , for example , after two of New York 's three delegates abandoned the Convention in mid July with no intention of returning , New York was left unable to vote on any further proposals at the Convention , although Hamilton would continue to periodically attend and occasionally to speak during the debates .
