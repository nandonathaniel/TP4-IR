The original Polo Grounds burned down in 1911 and the Highlanders allowed the Giants to play in Hilltop Park during reconstruction . Relations between the two teams warmed , and the Highlanders would move into the newly rebuilt Polo Grounds in 1913 . Now playing on the Harlem River , a far cry from their high - altitude home , the name `` Highlanders '' no longer applied , and fell into disuse among the press . The media had already widely adopted the `` Yankees '' nickname coined by the New York Press , and in 1913 the team became officially known as the New York Yankees .
