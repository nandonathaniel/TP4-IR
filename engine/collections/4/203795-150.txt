To recover damages , a claimant must show that the breach of contract caused foreseeable loss . Hadley v Baxendale established that the test of foreseeability is both objective or subjective . In other words , is it foreseeable to the objective bystander , or to the contracting parties , who may have special knowledge ? On the facts of this case , where a miller lost production because a carrier delayed taking broken mill parts for repair , the court held that no damages were payable since the loss was foreseeable neither by the `` reasonable man '' nor by the carrier , both of whom would have expected the miller to have a spare part in store .
