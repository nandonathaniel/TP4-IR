Escherichia coli ( / ˌɛʃɪˈrɪkiə ˈkoʊlaɪ / ; also known as E. coli ) is a Gram - negative , facultatively anaerobic , rod - shaped , coliform bacterium of the genus Escherichia that is commonly found in the lower intestine of warm - blooded organisms ( endotherms ) . Most E. coli strains are harmless , but some serotypes can cause serious food poisoning in their hosts , and are occasionally responsible for product recalls due to food contamination . The harmless strains are part of the normal flora of the gut , and can benefit their hosts by producing vitamin K , and preventing colonization of the intestine with pathogenic bacteria , having a symbiotic relationship . E. coli is expelled into the environment within fecal matter . The bacterium grows massively in fresh fecal matter under aerobic conditions for 3 days , but its numbers decline slowly afterwards .
