Today , Paul 's epistles continue to be vital roots of the theology , worship and pastoral life in the Catholic and Protestant traditions of the West , as well as the Orthodox traditions of the East . Paul 's influence on Christian thought and practice has been characterized as being as `` profound as it is pervasive '' , among that of many other apostles and missionaries involved in the spread of the Christian faith . Augustine of Hippo developed Paul 's idea that salvation is based on faith and not `` works of the law '' . Martin Luther 's interpretation of Paul 's writings influenced Luther 's doctrine of sola fide .
