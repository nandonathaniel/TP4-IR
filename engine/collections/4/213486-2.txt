A PT boat ( short for patrol torpedo boat ) was a torpedo - armed fast attack craft used by the United States Navy in World War II . It was small , fast , and inexpensive to build , valued for its maneuverability and speed but hampered at the beginning of the war by ineffective torpedoes , limited armament , and comparatively fragile construction that limited some of the variants to coastal waters .
