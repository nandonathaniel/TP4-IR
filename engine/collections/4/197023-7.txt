Early people began altering communities of flora and fauna for their own benefit through means such as fire - stick farming and forest gardening very early . Exact dates are hard to determine , as people collected and ate seeds before domesticating them , and plant characteristics may have changed during this period without human selection . An example is the semi-tough rachis and larger seeds of cereals from just after the Younger Dryas ( about 9,500 BC ) in the early Holocene in the Levant region of the Fertile Crescent . Monophyletic characteristics were attained without any human intervention , implying that apparent domestication of the cereal rachis could have occurred quite naturally .
