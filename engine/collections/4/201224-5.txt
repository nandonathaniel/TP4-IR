The man was free to eat from any tree in the garden except the tree of the knowledge of good and evil . Last of all , the God made a woman ( Eve ) from a rib of the man to be a companion for the man . In chapter three , the man and the woman were seduced by the serpent into eating the forbidden fruit , and they were expelled from the garden to prevent them from eating of the tree of life , and thus living forever . Cherubim were placed east of the garden , `` and a flaming sword which turned every way , to keep him away from the tree of life '' ( Genesis 3 : 24 ) .
