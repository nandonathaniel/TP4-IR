Aufmarsch I West was one of four deployment plans available to the German General Staff in 1914 . Each plan favoured certain operations , but did not specify exactly how those operations were to be carried out , leaving the commanding officers to carry those out at their own initiative and with minimal oversight . Aufmarsch I West , designed for a one - front war with France , had been retired once it became clear it was irrelevant to the wars Germany could expect to face ; both Russia and Britain were expected to help France , and there was no possibility of Italian nor Austro - Hungarian troops being available for operations against France . But despite its unsuitability , and the availability of more sensible and decisive options , it retained a certain allure due to its offensive nature and the pessimism of pre-war thinking , which expected offensive operations to be short - lived , costly in casualties , and unlikely to be decisive . Accordingly , the Aufmarsch II West deployment was changed for the offensive of 1914 , despite its unrealistic goals and the insufficient forces Germany had available for decisive success . Moltke took Schlieffen 's plan and modified the deployment of forces on the western front by reducing the right wing , the one to advance through Belgium , from 85 % to 70 % . In the end , the Schlieffen plan was so radically modified by Moltke , that it could be more properly called the Moltke Plan .
