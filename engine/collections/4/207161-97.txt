On September 29 , the hospital ship USNS Comfort left port at Norfolk , Virginia to help victims of Hurricanes Irma and Maria , and arrived in San Juan on October 3 . A couple of days later , the Comfort departed on an around the island tour to assist , remaining a dozen miles off shore . Patients were brought to the ship by helicopter or boat tender after being referred by Puerto Rico 's Department of Health . However , most of the 250 bed floating state - of - the - art hospital went unused despite overburdened island clinics and hospitals because there were few referrals . Governor Rossell√≥ explained on or about October 17 that `` The disconnect or the apparent disconnect was in the communications flow '' and added `` I asked for a complete revision of that so that we can now start sending more patients over there . '' After remaining offshore for three weeks , the Comfort docked in San Juan on October 27 , briefly departing only once to restock at sea from a naval resupply ship . As of Nov. 8 , the Comfort 's staff had treated 1,476 patients , including 147 surgeries and two births .
