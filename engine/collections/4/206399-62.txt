This election is now generally seen as a realigning election by political scientists . Republicans won majorities in both the House and the Senate , taking control of both chambers for the first time since 1954 . In addition , control of the House continued until 2007 . Newt Gingrich , who promoted a `` Contract with America '' , successfully nationalized the campaign by coordinating races around the country . The overwhelming nature of the Republicans ' victory points to a realignment ; the party gained 54 seats ( in a chamber of only 435 ) , while neither party would gain more than a handful of seats in any election until 2006 .
