A typological species is a group of organisms in which individuals conform to certain fixed properties ( a type ) , so that even pre-literate people often recognise the same taxon as do modern taxonomists . The clusters of variations or phenotypes within specimens ( such as longer or shorter tails ) would differentiate the species . This method was used as a `` classical '' method of determining species , such as with Linnaeus early in evolutionary theory . However , different phenotypes are not necessarily different species ( e.g. a four - winged Drosophila born to a two - winged mother is not a different species ) . Species named in this manner are called morphospecies .
