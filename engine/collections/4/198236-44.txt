The section between junctions 18 ( with the M60 ) and 29 ( with the M1 ) through Greater Manchester and West Yorkshire has been identified as one of the most congested roads in Britain . The motorway provides a direct link between two of the ten largest urban areas in England , and is the most practical route for HGVs and other commercial traffic between Manchester and Leeds . There are a significant amount of warehouses in these urban areas , which require commercial delivery to the ports at Merseyside and around the Humber , all of which are transported via the M62 .
