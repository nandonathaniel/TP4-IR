The battle secured the beachheads of the US Sixth Army on Leyte against attack from the sea , broke the back of Japanese naval power and opened the way for an advance to the Ryukyu Islands in 1945 . The only significant Japanese naval operation afterwards was the disastrous Operation Ten - Go in April 1945 . Kurita 's force had begun the battle with five battleships ; when he returned to Japan , only Yamato was combat - worthy . Nishimura 's sunken Yamashiro was the last battleship in history to engage another in combat .
