According to the folk etymology found in Genesis 25 : 26 , the name Yaʿaqob יעקב ‎ is derived from aqeb עָקֵב ‎ `` heel '' . The historical origin of the name is uncertain . Yaʿqob - ' el is notably recorded as a placename in a list by Thutmose III ( 15th century BC ) . The same name is recorded earlier still , in c. 1800 BC , in cuneiform inscriptions ( spelled ya - ah - qu - ub - el , ya - qu - ub - el ) . The suggestion that the personal name may be shortened from this compound name , which would translate to `` may El protect '' , originates with Bright ( 1960 ) . The Septuagint renders the name Ιακωβος , whence Latin Jacobus , English Jacob .
