Because she died in 1957 , the works of Wilder are now public domain in countries where the term of copyright lasts 50 years after the death of the author , or less ; generally this does not include works first published posthumously . Works first published before 1923 or where copyright was not renewed , primarily her newspaper columns , are also public domain in the United States .
