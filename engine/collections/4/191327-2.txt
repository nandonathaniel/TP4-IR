The Rotor is an amusement park ride , designed by German engineer Ernst Hoffmeister in the late 1940s . The ride was first demonstrated at Oktoberfest 1949 , and was exhibited at fairs and events throughout Europe during the 1950s and 1960s . The ride still appears in numerous amusement parks , although travelling variants have been surpassed by the Gravitron .
