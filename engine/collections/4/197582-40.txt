Like the majority of California rivers , the Yuba was dammed at many points during the 20th century , and large amounts of water are withdrawn for irrigation and municipal water supply . Daguerre Point Dam was built in 1906 by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in order to trap hydraulic mining debris . After concerns about its impact on fish populations , the dam was fitted with fish ladders in 1937 . In 1922 - 24 PG&E built the original Bullards Bar Dam to produce hydroelectricity and trap debris . The concrete arch Englebright Dam was built in 1941 to trap mining debris following the re-legalization of hydraulic mining during the 1930s . However , mining never resumed on a Gold Rush scale in the Yuba River watershed . Today , Englebright serves mainly to produce hydroelectricity .
