Web 2.0 offers almost all users the same freedom to contribute . While this opens the possibility for serious debate and collaboration , it also increases the incidence of `` spamming '' , `` trolling '' , and can even create a venue for racist hate speech , cyberbullying and defamation . The impossibility of excluding group members who do not contribute to the provision of goods ( i.e. , to the creation of a user - generated website ) from sharing the benefits ( of using the website ) gives rise to the possibility that serious members will prefer to withhold their contribution of effort and `` free ride '' on the contributions of others . This requires what is sometimes called radical trust by the management of the Web site . According to Best , the characteristics of Web 2.0 are : rich user experience , user participation , dynamic content , metadata , Web standards , and scalability . Further characteristics , such as openness , freedom and collective intelligence by way of user participation , can also be viewed as essential attributes of Web 2.0 . Some websites require users to contribute user - generated content to have access to the website , to discourage `` free riding '' .
