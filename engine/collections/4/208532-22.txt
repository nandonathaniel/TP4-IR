In October 1776 , at the age of 17 , Wilberforce went up to St John 's College , Cambridge . The deaths of his grandfather and uncle in 1777 had left him independently wealthy and as a result he had little inclination or need to apply himself to serious study . Instead he immersed himself in the social round of student life and pursued a hedonistic lifestyle enjoying cards , gambling and late - night drinking sessions -- although he found the excesses of some of his fellow students distasteful . Witty , generous and an excellent conversationalist , Wilberforce was a popular figure . He made many friends including the more studious future Prime Minister William Pitt . Despite his lifestyle and lack of interest in studying he managed to pass his examinations and was awarded a B.A. in 1781 and an M.A. in 1788 .
