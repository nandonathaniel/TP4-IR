Elements in the same group tend to show patterns in atomic radius , ionization energy , and electronegativity . From top to bottom in a group , the atomic radii of the elements increase . Since there are more filled energy levels , valence electrons are found farther from the nucleus . From the top , each successive element has a lower ionization energy because it is easier to remove an electron since the atoms are less tightly bound . Similarly , a group has a top - to - bottom decrease in electronegativity due to an increasing distance between valence electrons and the nucleus . There are exceptions to these trends : for example , in group 11 , electronegativity increases farther down the group .
