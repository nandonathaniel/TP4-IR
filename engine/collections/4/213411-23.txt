The origin of the name Όλυμπος Olumpos is unknown and usually considered of `` pre-Greek '' origin . In Homeric Greek ( Odyssey 6.42 ) , the variant Οὔλυμπος Oulumpos occurs , conceived of as the seat of the gods ( and not identified with any specific peak ) . Homer ( Iliad 5.754 , Odyssey 20.103 ) also appears to be using οὔλυμπος as a common noun , as a synonym of οὐρανός ouranos `` sky '' . Mt Olympus was historically also known as Mount Belus , after Iliad 1.591 , where the seat of the gods is referred to as βηλ ( ός ) θεσπεσίο ( ς ) `` heavenly threshold '' .
