The Welsh word Brython was introduced into English usage by John Rhys in 1884 as a term unambiguously referring to the P - Celtic speakers of Great Britain , to complement Goidel ; hence the adjective Brythonic referring to the group of languages . `` Brittonic languages '' is a more recent coinage ( first attested 1923 according to the Oxford English Dictionary ) intended to refer to the ancient Britons specifically .
