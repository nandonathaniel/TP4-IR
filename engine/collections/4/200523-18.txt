Ledger and Christopher Nolan both explained seeing eye - to - eye on the Joker 's appearance in the film , sharing common reference points for who the character was going to be . Based on philosophical ideas of anarchy and chaos , they looked at art by Francis Bacon for visual reference and they talked about Malcolm McDowell 's performance as Alex in Stanley Kubrick 's film A Clockwork Orange , and who Alex is in Anthony Burgess ' novel of the same name . Ledger was given Alan Moore 's graphic novel Batman : The Killing Joke for preparation for the role , as well as Grant Morrison 's graphic novel Arkham Asylum : A Serious House on Serious Earth , which the actor `` really tried to read and put it down '' . In an interview with MTV , Ledger said he regarded the experience playing the Joker as the most fun he ever had , `` and probably will ever have '' .
