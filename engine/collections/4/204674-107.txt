The large deliberative bodies of the United Nations ( the General Assembly and Economic and Social Council , as well as their subsidiary organs ) generally require the attendance of one - third of the membership ( currently 65 states in the General Assembly and 18 in ECOSOC ) to conduct most business , but a majority of members ( currently 97 states in the General Assembly and 28 states in ECOSOC ) in order to take any substantive decisions . The rules of the United Nations Security Council make no provisions for quorum , but nine votes are in all cases required to pass any substantive measure , effectively meaning that a meeting with fewer than nine members in attendance is pointless .
