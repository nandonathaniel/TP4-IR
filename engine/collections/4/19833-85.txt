In AD 83 -- 84 , the General Gnaeus Julius Agricola defeated the Caledonians at the Battle of Mons Graupius . Tacitus wrote that , before the battle , the Caledonian leader , Calgacus , gave a rousing speech in which he called his people the `` last of the free '' and accused the Romans of `` making the world a desert and calling it peace '' ( freely translated ) . After the Roman victory , Roman forts were briefly set along the Gask Ridge close to the Highland line ( only Cawdor near Inverness is known to have been constructed beyond that line ) . Three years after the battle , the Roman armies had withdrawn to the Southern Uplands .
