Reginald Aldworth Daly offered a somewhat different explanation for atoll formation : islands worn away by erosion , by ocean waves and streams , during the last glacial stand of the sea of some 900 feet ( 270 m ) below present sea level developed as coral islands ( atolls ) , or barrier reefs on a platform surrounding a volcanic island not completely worn away , as sea level gradually rose from melting of the glaciers . Discovery of the great depth of the volcanic remnant beneath many atolls such as at Midway Atoll favors the Darwin explanation , although there can be little doubt that fluctuating sea level has had considerable influence on atolls and other reefs .
