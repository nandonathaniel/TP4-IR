However , Justin does not speak of Hebrews 4 , instead holding that there is no longer any need for weekly Sabbath - keeping for anyone . Hippolytus of Rome , in the early third century , interpreted the term in Hebrews 4 to have special reference to a millennial Sabbath kingdom after six millennia of labor .
