Benton recognized the significance of Calhoun 's action , saying `` You have broken a minister and made a vice president . '' John Tyler , then serving as a Senator from Virginia , also recognized Calhoun 's overreach , writing to a friend that `` Van Buren is elevated by the silly thing of rejecting him . '' As Benton and Tyler foresaw , Calhoun 's move backfired , by making Van Buren appear the victim of petty politics , thus raising him in both Jackson 's regard and the esteem of others in the Democratic Party . Far from ending Van Buren 's career , Calhoun 's action gave greater impetus to Van Buren 's candidacy for vice president .
