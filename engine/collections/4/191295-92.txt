The present arrangement is from 1811 , designed by Antonio Munoz . The bust of Raphael ( 1833 ) is by Giuseppe Fabris . The two plaques commemorate Maria Bibbiena and Annibale Carracci . Behind the tomb is the statue known as the Madonna del Sasso ( Madonna of the Rock ) so named because she rests one foot on a boulder . It was commissioned by Raphael and made by Lorenzetto in 1524 .
