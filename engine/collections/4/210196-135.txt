In 2010 , a computer model was developed to simulate the physical oceanographic effects of one or several 100 megawatt OTEC plant ( s ) . The model suggests that OTEC plants can be configured such that the plant can conduct continuous operations , with resulting temperature and nutrient variations that are within naturally occurring levels . Studies to date suggest that by discharging the OTEC flows downwards at a depth below 70 meters , the dilution is adequate and nutrient enrichment is small enough so that 100 - megawatt OTEC plants could be operated in a sustainable manner on a continuous basis .
