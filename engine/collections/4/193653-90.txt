The film is notable for its innovative use of classical music taken from existing commercial recordings . Most feature films then and now are typically accompanied by elaborate film scores or songs written specially for them by professional composers . In the early stages of production , Kubrick had actually commissioned a score for 2001 from Hollywood composer Alex North , who had written the score for Spartacus and also worked on Dr. Strangelove . However , during postproduction , Kubrick chose to abandon North 's music in favor of the now - familiar classical pieces he had earlier chosen as `` guide pieces '' for the soundtrack . North did not know of the abandonment of the score until after he saw the film 's premiere screening .
