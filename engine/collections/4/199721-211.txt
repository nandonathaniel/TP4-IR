Economics has been subject to criticism that it relies on unrealistic , unverifiable , or highly simplified assumptions , in some cases because these assumptions simplify the proofs of desired conclusions . Examples of such assumptions include perfect information , profit maximization and rational choices . The field of information economics includes both mathematical - economical research and also behavioural economics , akin to studies in behavioural psychology .
