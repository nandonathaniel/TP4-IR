With the advent of the Information Age at the end of the 20th century , modern humans live in a world that has become increasingly globalized and interconnected . As of 2010 , almost 2 billion humans are able to communicate with each other via the Internet , and 3.3 billion by mobile phone subscriptions . Although interconnection between humans has encouraged the growth of science , art , discussion , and technology , it has also led to culture clashes and the development and use of weapons of mass destruction . Human civilization has led to environmental destruction and pollution significantly contributing to the ongoing mass extinction of other forms of life called the Holocene extinction event , which may be further accelerated by global warming in the future .
