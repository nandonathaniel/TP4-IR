In three villages southwest of Jerusalem and at Qalqilya , houses were destroyed `` not in battle , but as punishment ... and in order to chase away the inhabitants ... contrary to government ... policy , '' Dayan wrote in his memoirs . In Qalqilya , about a third of the homes were razed and about 12,000 inhabitants were evicted , though many then camped out in the environs . The evictees in both areas were allowed to stay and later were given cement and tools by the Israeli authorities to rebuild at least some of their dwellings .
