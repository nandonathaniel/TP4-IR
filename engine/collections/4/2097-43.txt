In Romania , for example , in the highland landscape of the Transylvanian Apuseni mountains , scything is a very important annual activity , taking about 2 -- 3 weeks to complete for a regular house . As scything is a tiring physical activity and is relatively difficult to learn , farmers help each other by forming teams . After each day 's harvest , the farmers often celebrate by having a small feast where they dance , drink and eat , while being careful to keep in shape for the next day 's hard work . In other parts of the Balkans , such as in Serbian towns , scything competitions are held where the winner takes away a small silver scythe . In small Serbian towns , scything is treasured as part of the local folklore , and the winners of friendly competitions are rewarded richly with food and drink , which they share with their competitors .
