In addition to the Tanakh , mainstream Rabbinic Judaism considers the Talmud ( Hebrew : תַּלְמוּד ) to be another central , authoritative text . It takes the form of a record of rabbinic discussions pertaining to Jewish law , ethics , philosophy , customs , and history . The Talmud has two components : the Mishnah ( c. 200 AD ) , the first written compendium of Judaism 's oral Law ; and the Gemara ( c. 500 AD ) , an elucidation of the Mishnah and related Tannaitic writings that often ventures onto other subjects and expounds broadly on the Tanakh . There are numerous citations of Sirach within the Talmud , even though the book was not ultimately accepted into the Hebrew canon .
