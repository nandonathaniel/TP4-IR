In 1949 , Alan Lomax , then working as folk music director for Decca Records , brought Solomon Linda 's 78 recording to the attention of his friend Pete Seeger of the folk group The Weavers . In November 1951 , after having performed the song for at least a year in their concerts , The Weavers recorded an adapted version with brass and string orchestra and chorus and released it as a 78 single entitled `` Wimoweh '' , a mishearing of the original song 's chorus of `` Uyimbube '' , Zulu : You are a lion . Their version contained the chanting chorus `` Wimoweh '' and Linda 's improvised melodic line . The Weavers credited the song as `` Traditional '' , with arrangement by `` Paul Campbell '' , later found to be a pseudonym used by the Weavers in order to claim royalties . It reached Billboard 's top ten and became a staple of The Weavers ' live repertoire , achieving further exposure on their best - selling The Weavers at Carnegie Hall LP album , recorded in 1955 and issued in 1957 . The song was also covered extensively by other folk revival groups such as The Kingston Trio , and exotica singer Yma Sumac . However , Miriam Makeba , in 1960 , recorded the same song as `` Mbube '' , with the writing credit given to `` J. Linda '' .
