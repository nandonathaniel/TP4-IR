Because of Fagen 's reluctance to sing live , Palmer handled most of the vocal duties on stage . During the first tour , however , Katz and Becker decided that they preferred Fagen 's interpretations of the band 's songs , persuading him to take over . Palmer quietly left the group while it recorded its second album . He wrote the No. 2 hit `` Jazzman '' ( 1974 ) with Carole King .
