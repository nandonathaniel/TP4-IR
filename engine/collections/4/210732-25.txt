The Starfleet officers and crewmembers seen in The Next Generation wear a jumpsuit with a Starfleet communicator badge ( or ' combadge ' as it was sometimes called ) on the left chest and rank insignia on the right side of the collar . The black areas are seen on the shoulders and the pants and the uniforms 's sleeves and abdominal area are colored to indicate the individual 's branch , with red indicating command and helm ; gold for engineering , security , and operations ; and blue for science and medical ( TNG : `` Encounter at Farpoint '' ) . The division colors for command and operations switched from those used in Enterprise and TOS . In early episodes , some crew members can be seen wearing a tunic version of the uniform with bare legs and boots .
