Church going played an important part in the lives of many women . Women were largely excluded from the administration of the Kirk , but when heads of households voted on the appointment of a new minister some parishes allowed women in that position to participate . In the post-Reformation period there was a criminalisation of women . Women were disciplined in kirk sessions and civil courts for stereotypical offences including scolding and prostitution , which were seen as deviant , rather than criminal . These changing attitudes may partly explain the witch hunts that occurred after the Reformation and in which women were the largest group of victims .
