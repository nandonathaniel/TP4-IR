The wide range of forms the shotgun can take leads to some significant differences between what is technically a shotgun and what is legally considered a shotgun . A fairly broad attempt to define a shotgun is made in the United States Code ( 18 USC 921 ) , which defines the shotgun as `` a weapon designed or redesigned , made or remade , and intended to be fired from the shoulder , and designed or redesigned and made or remade to use the energy of the explosive in a fixed shotgun shell to fire through a smooth bore either a number of ball shot or a single projectile for each single pull of the trigger . '' It is even more broadly defined in English law : `` a smooth bore gun not being an air gun '' ( s. 1 ( 3 ) ( a ) Firearms Act 1968 ) .
