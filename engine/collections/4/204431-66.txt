The pancreas was first identified by Herophilus ( 335 -- 280 BC ) , a Greek anatomist and surgeon . A few hundred years later , Rufus of Ephesus , another Greek anatomist , gave the pancreas its name . Etymologically , the term `` pancreas '' , a modern Latin adaptation of Greek πάγκρεας , ( πᾶν ( `` all '' , `` whole '' ) , and κρέας ( `` flesh '' ) ) , originally means sweetbread , although literally meaning all - flesh , presumably because of its fleshy consistency . It was only in 1889 when Oskar Minkowski discovered that removing the pancreas from a dog caused it to become diabetic ( insulin was later discovered by Frederick Banting and Charles Herbert Best in 1921 ) .
