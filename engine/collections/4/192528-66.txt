In 1550 , having once more been refused a request for trade , the Tümed Mongols under Altan Khan invaded the Xuan -- Da region . However , despite several attempts , he could not take Xuanfu due to Weng Wanda 's double fortified line while the garrison at Datong bribed him to not attack there . Instead of continuing to operate in the area , he circled around Weng Wanda 's wall to the relatively lightly defended Gubeikou , northeast of Beijing . From there Altan Khan passed through the defences and raided the suburbs of Beijing . According to one contemporary source , the raid took more than 60,000 lives and an additional 40,000 people became prisoners . As a response to this raid , the focus of the Ming 's northern defences shifted from the Xuan -- Da region to the Jizhou ( 薊 州 鎮 ) and Changping Defence Commands ( 昌平 鎮 ) where the breach took place . Later in the same year , the dry - stone walls of the Jizhou -- Changping area ( abbreviated as `` Ji - Chang '' ) were replaced by stone and mortar . These allowed the Chinese to build on steeper , more easily defended slopes and facilitated construction of features such as ramparts , crenelations , and peepholes . The effectiveness of the new walls was demonstrated in the failed Mongol raid of 1554 , where raiders expecting a repeat of the events of 1550 were surprised by the higher wall and stiff Chinese resistance .
