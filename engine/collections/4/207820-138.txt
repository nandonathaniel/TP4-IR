To prevent regulatory capture within the SEC and increase the influence of investors , the Act creates an Office of the Investor Advocate , an Investor Advisory Committee composed of 12 -- 22 members of whom serve 4 - year terms , and an ombudsman appointed by the Office of the Investor Advocate . The Investor Advisory Committee was actually created in 2009 and therefore predates the passage of the Act , but it is specifically authorized under the Act .
