The boundaries drawn were , however , quite varied . In 1931 , Robert Gradmann called the Central Black Forest the catchment area of the Kinzig and in the west the section up to the lower Elz and Kinzig tributary of the Gutach . A pragmatic division , which is oriented not just on natural and cultural regions , uses the most important transverse valleys . Based on that , the Central Black Forest is bounded by the Kinzig in the north and the line from Dreisam to Gutach in the south , corresponding to the Bonndorf Graben zone and the course of the present day B 31 .
