Loeb confirmed in July 2017 that the series would be set in the MCU , but that the show 's characters would not be concerned with the actions of the Avengers , for example , saying , `` Would you be following Iron Man ( on social media ) or would you be following someone your own age ? The fact that they 've found each other and they 're going through this mystery together at the moment is what we 're concerned about , not what Captain America is doing . '' The showrunners considered the series ' connection to the MCU to be `` liberating '' , as it allowed them to set the series in a universe where superheroics and fantasy are already established and do not need to be explained to the audience . However , the series does not draw attention to `` the idea that maybe other people have powers too '' . Schwartz said , `` You could read it as because they live in California , and ( The Avengers ) took place in New York , or because it did n't take place in our world . Marvel 's position is everything is connected , but our show is trying to walk that line where the reality our kids are facing , they are facing for the first time . '' He also said they `` were very capable of telling the story that we wanted to tell independent of any of the other Marvel stories that are out there . ''
