Writing for Rolling Stone , Peter Travers gave the film 3 out of 4 stars and praised the cast , saying , `` Ocean 's 8 is a heist caper that looks gorgeous , keeps the twists coming and bounces along on a comic rhythm that 's impossible to resist . What more do you want in summer escapism ? '' Alonso Duralde of TheWrap called the film `` slick , charming and funny , '' though added it never quite kicks into high gear '' and said , `` Cinematographer Eigil Bryld gives the proceedings the high - gloss of a SkyMall catalog , which is appropriate for a movie about robbing a legendary Cartier necklace at fashion 's most exclusive event ... And between the sheen and the talented performers , Ocean 's 8 does eventually coast on froth and good will . ''
