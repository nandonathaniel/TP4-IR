In the 4th and early 3rd century BC , Gallic clan confederations expanded far beyond the territory of what would become Roman Gaul ( which defines usage of the term `` Gaul '' today ) , into Pannonia , Illyria , northern Italy , Transylvania and even Asia Minor . By the 2nd century BC , the Romans described Gallia Transalpina as distinct from Gallia Cisalpina . In his Gallic Wars , Julius Caesar distinguishes among three ethnic groups in Gaul : the Belgae in the north ( roughly between Rhine and Seine ) , the Celtae in the center and in Armorica , and the Aquitani in the southwest , the southeast being already colonized by the Romans . While some scholars believe the Belgae south of the Somme were a mixture of Celtic and Germanic elements , their ethnic affiliations have not been definitively resolved . One of the reasons is political interference upon the French historical interpretation during the 19th century .
