The expedition spent about a month exploring the region , collecting specimens and naming sites of interest . A Montana writer and lawyer named Cornelius Hedges , who had been a member of the Washburn expedition , proposed that the region should be set aside and protected as a national park ; he wrote detailed articles about his observations for the Helena Herald newspaper between 1870 and 1871 . Hedges essentially restated comments made in October 1865 by acting Montana Territorial Governor Thomas Francis Meagher , who had previously commented that the region should be protected . Others made similar suggestions . In an 1871 letter from Jay Cooke to Ferdinand V. Hayden , Cooke wrote that his friend , Congressman William D. Kelley had also suggested `` Congress pass a bill reserving the Great Geyser Basin as a public park forever '' .
