The U.S. dropped over 7 million tons of bombs on Indochina during the war -- more than triple the 2.1 million tons of bombs the U.S. dropped on Europe and Asia during all of World War II , and more than ten times the amount dropped by the U.S. during the Korean War . 500 thousand tons were dropped on Cambodia , 1 million tons were dropped on North Vietnam , and 4 million tons were dropped on South Vietnam . On a per capita basis , the 2 million tons dropped on Laos make it the most heavily bombed country in history ; The New York Times noted this was `` nearly a ton for every person in Laos . '' Former U.S. Air Force official Earl Tilford has recounted `` repeated bombing runs of a lake in central Cambodia . The B - 52s literally dropped their payloads in the lake '' : The Air Force ran many missions of this kind for the purpose of securing additional funding during budget negotiations , so the amount of tonnage expended does not directly correlate with the resulting damage .
