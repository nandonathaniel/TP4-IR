The play reduced the number of girls in the Brodie Set from six to four ( and discarded another girl not in the set ) and some of them are composites of girls in the novel . Mary is a composite of the original Mary and Joyce Emily ; although mainly based on the original Mary , in the novel it was Joyce Emily who died in the Spanish Civil War ( Mary later dies in a fire instead ) and rather more is made of this incident in the play than the novel . Jenny is a composite of the original Jenny and Rose ; in spite of her name she has more in common with Rose , since in the novel it was she who Miss Brodie tried to manoeuvre into having an affair with Mr Lloyd .
