The Temple stressed egalitarian ideals , asking members to attend in casual clothes so poor members would not feel out of place , and providing shelter for the needy . While the Temple had increased its African - American membership from 15 % to nearly 50 % , in order to attempt further gains the Temple hired African - American preacher Archie Ijames ( who had earlier given up organized religion ) . Pastor Ijames was one of the first to commit to Jones ' socialist collective program . In 1959 , the church joined the Christian Church ( Disciples of Christ ) , and was renamed the Peoples Temple Christian Church Full Gospel . This affiliation was a successful attempt to both raise the dwindling membership and restore the reputation of the organization .
