Arba'een commemorates the suffering of the women and children of Husayn ibn Ali 's household . After Husayn was killed , they were marched over the desert , from Karbala ( central Iraq ) to Shaam ( Damascus , Syria ) . Many children ( some of whom were direct descendants of Muhammad ) died of thirst and exposure along the route . Arbaein occurs on the 20th of Safar , 40 days after Ashurah .
