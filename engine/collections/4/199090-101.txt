In traditional societies , the age of consent for a sexual union was a matter for the family to decide , or a tribal custom . In most cases , this coincided with signs of puberty , menstruation for a woman , and pubic hair for a man . The ancient Greek poet Hesiod in Works and Days ( c. 700 BC ) suggests that a man should marry around the age of thirty , and that he should take a wife who is five years past puberty .
