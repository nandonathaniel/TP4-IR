`` The Native Americans at Acoma revolted against this Spanish encroachment but faced severe suppression . In battles with the Acomas , OÃ±ate lost 11 soldiers and two servants , killed hundreds of Indians , and punished every man over 25 years of age by the amputation of their left foot . The Franciscans found the pueblo people increasingly unwilling to consent to baptism by newcomers who continued to demand food , clothing and labor . Acoma is also known as the oldest continually inhabited city in the United States . ''
