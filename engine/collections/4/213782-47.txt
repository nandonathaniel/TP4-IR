Many have given suggestions as Jason 's motivation for killing . Ken Kirzinger refers to Jason as a `` psychotic mama 's boy gone horribly awry ... very resilient . You ca n't kill him , but he feels pain , just not like everyone else . '' Kirzinger goes on to say that Jason is a `` psycho - savant '' , and believes his actions are based on pleasing his mother , and not anything personal . Andrew O'Hehir has stated , `` Coursing hormones act , of course , as smelling salts to prudish Jason , that ever - vigilant enforcer of William Bennett - style values . '' Todd Farmer , writer for Jason X , wrote the scene where Jason wakes from cryonic hibernation just as two of the teenagers are having sex . Farmer liked the idea that sex acts triggered Jason back to life . Whatever his motivations , Kane Hodder believes there is a limit to what he will do . According to Hodder , Jason might violently murder any person he comes across , but when Jason Takes Manhattan called for Hodder to kick the lead character 's dog , Hodder refused , stating that , while Jason has no qualms against killing humans , he is not bad enough to hurt animals . Another example from Jason Takes Manhattan , involves Jason being confronted by a street gang of young teenage boys one of whom threatens him with a knife , however Jason chooses not to kill them and instead scares them off by lifting up his mask and showing them his face . Likewise , director Tom McLoughlin chose not to have Jason harm any of the children he encounters in Jason Lives , stating that Jason would not kill a child , out of a sympathy for the plight of children generated by his own death as a child .
