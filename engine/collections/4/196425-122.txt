In July 2013 , John Williams was confirmed to compose the score . The music for the film 's first two trailers was reworked from earlier Williams compositions . He began working on the film in December 2014 , and by June 2015 had been through most of the film reels , working on a daily basis . In May 2015 , Williams stated that he would return to themes from the previous films , such as ones for Luke , Leia and Han , in ways that `` will seem very natural and right in the moments for which we 've chosen to do these kinds of quotes . There are n't many of them , but there are a few that I think are important and will seem very much a part of the fabric of the piece in a positive and constructive way . '' He said that working with Abrams was similar to the process he went through with Lucas in the earlier films .
