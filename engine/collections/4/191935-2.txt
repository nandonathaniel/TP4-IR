The word originates from the word sale ( salt ) with a termination ( ame ) that in Italian indicates a collective noun . Thus , it originally meant `` all kinds of salted ( meats ) '' . The Italian tradition of cured meats includes several styles , and the word salame soon specifically meant only the most popular kind -- a salted and spiced meat , ground and extruded into an elongated , thin casing ( usually cleaned animal intestine ) , then left to undergo natural fermentation for days , months , or even years .
