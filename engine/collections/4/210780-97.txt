The farcical anti-climax : The holiday spirit might also have been responsible for an aspect of the comic plot that can seem bewildering to modern audiences . The major confrontation ( agon ) between the ' good ' and ' bad ' characters in a play is often resolved decisively in favour of the former long before the end of the play . The rest of the play deals with farcical consequences in a succession of loosely connected scenes . The farcical anti-climax has been explained in a variety of ways , depending on the particular play . In The Wasps , for instance , it has been thought to indicate a gradual change in the main character 's perspective as the lessons of the agon are slowly absorbed . In The Acharnians , it has been explained in terms of a unifying theme that underlies the episodes , demonstrating the practical benefits that come with wisdom . But the early release of dramatic tension is consistent with the holiday meanings in Old Comedy and it allows the audience to relax in uncomplicated enjoyment of the spectacle , the music , jokes and celebrations that characterize the remainder of the play . The celebration of the hero 's victory often concludes in a sexual conquest and sometimes it takes the form of a wedding , thus providing the action with a joyous sense of closure .
