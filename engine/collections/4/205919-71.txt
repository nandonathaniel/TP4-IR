In October 1973 , Long and Senator Abraham Ribicoff ( D - CT ) introduced a bipartisan bill for catastrophic health insurance coverage for workers financed by payroll taxes and for Medicare beneficiaries , and federalization of Medicaid with extension to the poor without dependent minor children . In February 1974 , Nixon proposed more comprehensive health insurance reform -- an employer mandate to offer private health insurance if employees volunteered to pay 25 percent of premiums , replacement of Medicaid by state - run health insurance plans available to all with income - based premiums and cost sharing , and replacement of Medicare with a new federal program that eliminated the limit on hospital days , added income - based out - of - pocket limits , and added outpatient prescription drug coverage . In April 1974 , Kennedy and Mills introduced a bill for near - universal national health insurance with benefits identical to the expanded Nixon plan -- but with mandatory participation by employers and employees through payroll taxes and with lower cost sharing -- both plans were criticized by labor , consumer , and senior citizens organizations because of their substantial cost sharing .
