He designed and patented a system of automatic weir water floodgates that were first installed in 1903 at Khadakvasla Reservoir near Pune . These gates were employed to raise flood supply level of storage in reservoir to the highest level likely to be attained without causing any damage to the dam . Based on the success of these gates , the same system was installed at the Tigra Dam in Gwalior and Krishna Raja Sagara ( KRS ) Dam in Mandya / Mysore , Karnataka .
