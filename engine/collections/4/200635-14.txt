Evaluation - focused : An evaluative trait is one that involves a fundamental value judgment about oneself , rather than a simple description ( `` I am confident and worthy , '' vs. `` I am ambitious '' ) . Job satisfaction is itself an evaluation that people make about their jobs ; therefore , an individuals ' evaluations , especially those regarding how they think of and value themselves , should have a large effect on their job satisfaction . Fundamental : A fundamental trait , also called a source trait , is one that is basic and underlying . Fundamental traits together cause broader `` surface '' traits , and affect all other more specific evaluations . For example , self - doubt and frustration are considered to be source traits that commonly predict the surface trait of aggression . Fundamental traits will have a stronger and more consistent effect on job satisfaction than surface traits . Large in scope : A trait which is large in scope , or global , will more likely generalize to the workplace than a specific trait will . For example , a global evaluation of one 's worth will better predict overall job satisfaction than a specific evaluation of one 's artistic ability .
