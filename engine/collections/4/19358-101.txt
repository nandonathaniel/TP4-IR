RKO 's movie ranch in Encino , a filming location of Bedford Falls , was razed in 1954 . There are only two surviving locations from the film . The first is the swimming pool that was unveiled during the famous dance scene where George courts Mary . It is located in the gymnasium at Beverly Hills High School and is still in operation as of 2013 . The second is the `` Martini home '' in La Ca√±ada Flintridge , California .
