The game preserves many of the core features of the Halo franchise 's gameplay experience . Players step into the MJOLNIR powered armor of a Spartan and control that character 's actions . MJOLNIR armor provides deflector shields , which diminish whilst protecting the wearer from weapons fire but recharge after a short recovery . Spartans may only carry two personal weapons at a time , but may swap them out at any time for any other weapon ( including those dropped by slain enemies ) and may also carry and fire a crew - served weapon ( discarded when the player switches back to a personal weapon ) . Spartans may also throw grenades and use their weapons for pistol - whipping . Finally , some of the vehicles and their mounted weapons are available for use .
