With both Bolsheviks and Mensheviks weakened by splits within their ranks and by Tsarist repression , they were tempted to try to re-unite the party .

Kamenev and Zinoviev were dubious about the idea , but were willing to give it a try under pressure from `` conciliator '' Bolsheviks like Victor Nogin .
