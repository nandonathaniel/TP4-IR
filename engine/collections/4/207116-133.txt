Over the years the philosophical terminology of `` management '' and `` leadership '' have , in the organizational context , been used both as synonyms and with clearly differentiated meanings . Debate is fairly common about whether the use of these terms should be restricted , and generally reflects an awareness of the distinction made by Burns ( 1978 ) between `` transactional '' leadership ( characterized by emphasis on procedures , contingent reward , management by exception ) and `` transformational '' leadership ( characterized by charisma , personal relationships , creativity ) .
