The Municipal Systems Act ( MSA ) placed the responsibility for water services on local governments . It thus became each city 's responsibility to provide basic water and sanitation services for all residents . The funding for improvements to water and sanitation systems would come from the national government via the Municipal Infrastructure Grant MIG or Equitable Shares , or via local revenue collection .
