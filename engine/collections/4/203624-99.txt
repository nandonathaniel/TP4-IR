Despite this shocking truth , Jesse constructs the weapon which , with the unwitting help of the Endermen , they use to enter the Wither Storm and destroy the Command Block , though Reuben is fatally wounded in the process and dies shortly after . As the world praises the new heroes , Jesse makes a memorial to Reuben and convinces Gabriel , who is now cured ( same with Petra ) , to either tell the truth about the Order 's past or continue keeping it a secret . Either way , Jesse and their friends are then made the famous New Order of the Stone .
