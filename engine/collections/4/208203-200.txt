Klinger eventually gives up his attempts at a Section 8 when he is picked by Colonel Potter to become the company clerk following Radar 's discharge . He is later promoted to Sergeant ( `` Promotion Commotion '' ) and begins to take his duties even more seriously ; the writers had decided to `` tap into his street skills '' to flesh out his character . In the eighth - season episode `` Dear Uncle Abdul '' , Klinger writes to his uncle -- who successfully used cross-dressing to stay out of the army -- about the crazy goings - on in camp , ending with the reflection `` It 's no wonder I never got a Section Eight -- there 's nothing special about me ; everybody here is crazy ! '' Klinger is a fan of the Toledo Mud Hens , an actual minor league baseball team , and occasionally voices his high opinion of the hot dogs at Tony Packo 's , an actual Toledo restaurant .
