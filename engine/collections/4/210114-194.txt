The Oz portrayed in the book is very close to Baum 's Oz , although Heinlein does make an attempt to explain some things from the standpoint of a science fiction author . He explains that Oz is on a retrograde planet , where the direction of rotation relative to the poles is reversed , resulting in the sun seeming to rise in what would normally be the west .
