Originally from New Jersey and a graduate of Princeton University , Leonard works as a Caltech experimental physicist , mainly working with lasers , and shares an apartment with colleague Sheldon Cooper in Pasadena , California . He is usually seen wearing his characteristic black thick - framed glasses , low - cut black Converse All Stars sneakers , pastel hoodies or neutral - colored sweat jackets ( i.e. jackets with integrated hoodies ) or a combination of the two , brown or red trousers ( or , less frequently , jeans ) , and physics - themed T - shirts . His various girlfriends have tried to change his outfits : Penny had no success while Stephanie got him to wear dress shirts and sweaters ( which he found uncomfortable ) , and Priya got him to briefly switch to dress shirts , waistcoats and dark slacks ; he reverted to his original outfits after she left for India , but started eschewing his hoodies in favor of button - down shirts and non-hooded jackets towards the end of the seventh season , a trend that continued into successive seasons .
