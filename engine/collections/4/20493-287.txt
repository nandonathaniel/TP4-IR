Like peoples of all other British colonies and Dominions at the time , those born in Canada before 1947 were British subjects by nationality under the British Nationality and Status of Aliens Act 1914 . The term `` Canadian citizen '' , however , was first created under the Immigration Act 1910 to identify a British subject who was born in Canada or who possessed Canadian domicile , which could be acquired by any British subject who had lawfully resided in Canada for at least three years . At that time , `` Canadian citizenship '' was solely an immigration term and not a nationality term , hence `` Canadian citizens '' under the Immigration Act would be subject to the same rules on acquisition and loss of British subject status under the British Nationality and Status of Aliens Act 1914 . Under the Immigration Act 1910 , `` Canadian citizenship '' would be lost for any person who had ceased to be a British subject , as well as non-Canadian born or naturalized British subjects who `` voluntarily ( reside ) outside Canada '' . While the former would lose `` Canadian citizenship '' and British subject status simultaneously , the latter would only stop being a `` Canadian citizen '' . Canadian - born or naturalized British subjects would not lose their Canadian domicile by residing outside Canada .
