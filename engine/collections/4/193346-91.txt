Adams 's religious views shifted over the course of his life . In college and early adulthood he preferred trinitarian theology , and from 1818 to 1848 he served as vice president of the American Bible Society . However , as he grew older his views became more typically Unitarian , though he rejected some of the views of Joseph Priestley and the Transcendentalists . He was a founding member of the First Unitarian Church of Washington ( D.C. ) . However he regularly attended Presbyterian and Episcopal services as well . Towards the end of his life , he wrote , `` I reverence God as my creator . As creator of the world . I reverence him with holy fear . I venerate Jesus Christ as my redeemer ; and , as far as I can understand , the redeemer of the world . But this belief is dark and dubious . ''
