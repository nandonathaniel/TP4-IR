Hiccup finds a book that was written by Hiccup Horrendous Haddock the II called A Hero 's Guide To Deadly Dragons which was exactly the same book that Hiccup the third wrote , which had been taken from him earlier that morning . He pulls the book out and the shelf opens , revealing a hole filled with Poisonous Piffleworms . Their only exit would be to go through the hole .
