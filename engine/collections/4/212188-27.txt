Jimmy Pesto , Sr. ( voiced by Jay Johnston ) -- Jimmy Pesto , Sr. , real surname Poplopovich , is the owner of the Italian themed restaurant across the street called `` Jimmy Pesto 's Pizzeria . '' Although of eastern European descent he goes by the Italian - sounding name of Pesto , presumably to increase the appeal of his restaurant ; he and his family members are invariably referred to by the Pesto last name . He is the father of Jimmy Pesto , Jr. , Andy , and Ollie , and is Bob 's personal rival . Their rivalry often seems to border on stalking each other and occasionally descends into violence . Their families actually get along well and apart from a few isolated incidents , neither of their businesses actually endanger the other . This is in part because Bob 's burgers are genuinely better than the food Jimmy serves , which is often described as being of sub par quality . In one episode where Jimmy tries to outdo Bob by serving burgers , he can be seen weeping in the middle of the night , knowing that the ruse wo n't last ; in another episode , Jimmy competes in a burger cookoff against Bob and a celebrity chef and his `` Oregano Burger '' is poorly received . It is revealed in `` The Belchies '' that he and his children 's mother are divorced ; she has not yet been seen .
