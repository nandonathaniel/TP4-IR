One of the most important Viking families in the Low Countries was that of Rorik of Dorestad ( based in Wieringen ) and his brother the `` younger Harald '' ( based in Walcheren ) , both thought to be nephews of Harald Klak . Around 850 , Lothair I acknowledged Rorik as ruler of most of Friesland . And again in 870 , Rorik was received by Charles the Bald in Nijmegen , to whom he became a vassal . Viking raids continued during that period . Harald 's son Rodulf and his men were killed by the people of Oostergo in 873 . Rorik died sometime before 882 .
