Julius Caesar is seen as the main example of Caesarism , a form of political rule led by a charismatic strongman whose rule is based upon a cult of personality , whose rationale is the need to rule by force , establishing a violent social order , and being a regime involving prominence of the military in the government . Other people in history , such as the French Napoleon Bonaparte and the Italian Benito Mussolini , have defined themselves as Caesarists . Bonaparte did not focus only on Caesar 's military career but also on his relation with the masses , a predecessor to populism . The word is also used in a pejorative manner by critics of this type of political rule .
