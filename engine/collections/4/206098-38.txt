In 1558 , Rokkaku Yoshikata employed a team of ninja to set fire to Sawayama Castle . A chunin captain led a force of 48 ninja into the castle by means of deception . In a technique dubbed bakemono - jutsu ( `` ghost technique '' ) , his men stole a lantern bearing the enemy 's family crest ( mon ) , and proceeded to make replicas with the same mon . By wielding these lanterns , they were allowed to enter the castle without a fight . Once inside , the ninja set fire to the castle , and Yoshitaka 's army would later emerge victorious . The mercenary nature of the shinobi is demonstrated in another arson attack soon after the burning of Sawayama Castle . In 1561 , commanders acting under Kizawa Nagamasa hired three Iga ninja of genin rank to assist the conquest of a fortress in Maibara . Rokakku Yoshitaka , the same man who had hired Iga ninja just years earlier , was the fortress holder -- and target of attack . The Asai Sandaiki writes of their plans : `` We employed shinobi - no - mono of Iga ... They were contracted to set fire to the castle '' . However , the mercenary shinobi were unwilling to take commands . When the fire attack did not begin as scheduled , the Iga men told the commanders , who were not from the region , that they could not possibly understand the tactics of the shinobi . They then threatened to abandon the operation if they were not allowed to act on their own strategy . The fire was eventually set , allowing Nagamasa 's army to capture the fortress in a chaotic rush .
