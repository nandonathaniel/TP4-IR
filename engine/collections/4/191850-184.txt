The Dome of the Rock with its inscriptions are interesting in the dating of the text . These inscriptions have been known to scholars for more than a century and have repeatedly been the subject of interpretation , yet little attention has been paid to the elements from which they were composed . On the inner face of the octagon the declaration of faith is followed by conflated verses describing the powers of God . Next Muhammad is introduced , with a blessing that , though not directly quoted from the Quran , was clearly already in use in 694 AD . Then comes an exhortation to Christians that Jesus was also a prophet and mortal , followed by the claim that God is sufficient unto Himself . Finally comes a command to bend to His will and the threat of reckoning for those who do not .
