At one point in the planning phase when a financing gap existed , planners proposed locating the Rock Hall in the then - vacant May Company Building , but finally decided to commission architect I.M. Pei to design a new building . Initial CEO Dr. Larry R. Thompson facilitated I.M. Pei in designs for the site . Pei came up with the idea of a tower with a glass pyramid protruding from it . The museum tower was initially planned to stand 200 ft ( 61 m ) high , but had to be cut down to 162 ft ( 49 m ) due to its proximity to Burke Lakefront Airport . The building 's base is approximately 150,000 square feet ( 14,000 m2 ) . The groundbreaking ceremony took place on June 7 , 1993 . Pete Townshend , Chuck Berry , Billy Joel , Sam Phillips , Ruth Brown , Sam Moore of Sam and Dave , Carl Gardner of the Coasters and Dave Pirner of Soul Asylum all appeared at the groundbreaking .
