Throughout much of the 19th century , industry was rapidly introduced to complement an existing agricultural economy . One of the first iron manufacturing plants opened near Youngstown in 1804 called Hopewell Furnace . By the mid-19th century , 48 blast furnaces were operating in the state , most in the southern portions of the state . Discovery of coal deposits aided the further development of the steel industry in the state , and by 1853 Cleveland was the third largest iron and steel producer in the country . The first Bessemer converter was purchased by the Cleveland Rolling Mill Company , which eventually became part of the U.S. Steel Corporation following the merger of Federal Steel Company and Carnegie Steel , the first billion - dollar American corporation . The first open - hearth furnace used for steel production was constructed by the Otis Steel Company in Cleveland , and by 1892 , Ohio ranked as the 2nd - largest steel producing state behind Pennsylvania . Republic Steel was founded in Youngstown in 1899 , and was at one point the nation 's third largest producer . Armco , now AK Steel , was founded in Middletown also in 1899 .
