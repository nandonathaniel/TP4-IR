The school dance arrives , broadcast live on television and hosted by DJ Vince Fontaine ( Edd Byrnes ) , who flirts with Marty . Rizzo and Kenickie attempt to spite one another by bringing Leo and Cha - Cha as their dates , while Danny and Sandy arrive together . Danny and Sandy dance well and appear to be on their way to winning the competition , but a drunken Sonny pulls Sandy off the floor partway through . Cha - Cha joins Danny for the rest of the dance , and the two win ( `` Born to Hand Jive '' ) . During the last dance ( `` Blue Moon '' ) , Putzie leads Sonny and Doody in a mooning of the national TV audience , which Principal McGee ( Eve Arden ) vows to put on their permanent records .
