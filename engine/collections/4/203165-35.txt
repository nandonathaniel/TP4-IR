In these extremely tough conditions , the British infantry were unable to move effectively against the retreating German and Turkish force in the following days . Alone , the Anzac Mounted Division was unable to stop the retreating force withdrawing to Katia and eventually back to their base at Bir el Abd . This base was abandoned the day after it was attacked by the Anzac Mounted Division , on 12 August 1916 , ending any threat to the Suez Canal for the remainder of the war . The battle cost the Allies 1,202 casualties of which 222 were killed , 71 died of wounds and 909 were wounded ; half of these were Australians .
