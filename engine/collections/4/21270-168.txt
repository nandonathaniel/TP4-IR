In 2015 , two inebriated senior service agents drove an official car into the White House complex and collided with a barrier . One of the congressmen in the United States House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform that investigated that incident was Jason Chaffetz . In September 2015 , it was revealed that 18 Secret Service employees or supervisors , including Assistant Director Ed Lowery , accessed an unsuccessful 2003 application by Chaffetz for employment with the agency and discussed leaking the information to the media in retaliation for Chaffetz ' investigations of agency misconduct . The confidential personal information was later leaked to The Daily Beast . Agency Director Joe Clancy apologized to Chaffetz and said that disciplinary action would be taken against those responsible .
