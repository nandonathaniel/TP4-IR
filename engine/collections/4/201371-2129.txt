When a batter makes an out but advances one or more runners in the process , he has made a productive out . In contrast , a strikeout or other out in which no runners advance is unproductive . An at bat that is productive is often said to be a `` good at bat '' , even if a batter does n't get safely on base . Statistically speaking , however , although a given out may be associated with scoring a run ( such as via a sacrifice fly , a fielder 's choice , or even a double play ) , an out reduces the number of future runs that are likely to be scored in the inning and game , when compared with a base hit or base - on balls that puts another runner on base who can potentially score .
