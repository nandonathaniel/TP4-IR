As Bo is a gift through a breeder , he is not a shelter dog . Dog expert Cesar Milan stated Bo could be considered part of a larger group known as `` rescue dogs '' . He was unsuccessful in his first home when plans for him to provide companionship to an older female dog went awry ; apparently his attempts to suckle irritated her . The Obamas pledged a donation to the DC Humane Society in a show of support for shelter dogs .
