Today , Gaelic type and the buailte are rarely used except where a `` traditional '' style is required , e.g. the motto on the University College Dublin coat of arms or the symbol of the Irish Defence Forces , The Irish Defence Forces cap badge ( Óglaiġ na h - Éireann ) . Letters with the buailte are available in Unicode and Latin - 8 character sets ( see Latin Extended Additional chart ) .
