The Central Lobby measures 18 metres ( 59 ft ) across and 23 metres ( 75 ft ) from the floor to the centre of the vaulted ceiling . The panels between the vault 's ribs are covered with Venetian glass mosaic displaying floral emblems and heraldic badges , and the bosses in the intersections of the ribs are also carved into heraldic symbols . Each wall of the Lobby is contained in an arch ornamented with statues of English and Scottish monarchs ; on four sides there are doorways , and the tympana above them are adorned with mosaics representing the patron saints of the United Kingdom 's constituent nations : Saint George for England , Saint Andrew for Scotland , Saint David for Wales and Saint Patrick for Ireland . The other four arches are occupied by high windows , under which there are stone screens -- the hall 's post office , one of two in the Palace , is located behind one of these screens . In front of them stand four bigger - than - life statues of 19th - century statesmen , including one of four - time Prime Minister William Ewart Gladstone . The floor on which they stand is tiled with Minton encaustic tiles in intricate patterns and includes a passage from Psalm 127 written in Latin , which translates as follows : `` Except the Lord build the House their labour is but lost that build it '' .
