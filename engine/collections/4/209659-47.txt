Under JKLF 's leadership on January 21 - 23 large scale protests were organised in valley . As a response to this largely explosive situation paramilitary units of BSF and CRPF were called . These units were used by the government to combat Maoist insurgency and the North - Eastern insurgency . The challenge to them in this situation was not posed by armed insurgents but by the stone pelters . Their inexperience caused atleast 50 casualties in Gawkadal massacre . In this incident the underground militant movement was transformed into a mass struggle . To curb the situation AFSPA ( Armed Forces Special Powers Act ) was imposed on Kashmir in September 1990 to supress the insurgency by giving armed forces the powers to kill and arrest without warrant to maintain public order . During this time the dominant tactic involved killing of a prominent figure in a public gathering to push forces into action and the public prevented them from capturing these insurgents . This sprouting of sympathisers in Kashmir led to the hard - line approach of Indian army .
