Initially , for some of its enterprise software , Microsoft continued to use a per - socket licensing system . However , for some software such as BizTalk Server 2013 , SQL Server 2014 , and Windows Server 2016 , Microsoft has shifted to per - core licensing . Oracle Corporation counts an AMD X2 or an Intel dual - core CPU as a single processor but uses other metrics for other types , especially for processors with more than two cores .
