In the fifth book , Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix , the Ministry of Magic has been waging a smear campaign against Harry and Dumbledore , disputing their claims that Voldemort has returned . Harry is made to look like an attention - seeking liar , and Dumbledore a trouble - maker . A new character is introduced when the Ministry of Magic appoints Dolores Umbridge as the latest Hogwarts ' Defence Against the Dark Arts instructor ( and Ministry spy ) . Because the paranoid Ministry suspects that Dumbledore is building a wizard army to overthrow them , Umbridge refuses to teach students real defensive magic . She gradually gains more power , eventually ousting Dumbledore and seizing control of the school . As a result , Harry 's increasingly angry and erratic behaviour nearly estranges him from Ron and Hermione .
