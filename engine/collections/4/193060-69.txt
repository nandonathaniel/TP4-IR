He showed Groening and showrunner Al Jean his Adult Swim shorts and Groening responded by giving him a free hand to do the 35 - second - long segment . Groening told him to break all The Simpsons rules , but Kricfalusi explains that he `` tried not to break any rules in the characters ' personalities , just in the execution of the visuals . I did n't follow any models -- not even my own '' . The more rules he broke , the more pleased Groening and Jean were with the result . Contrary to Banksy , who lives a life in secrecy , Kricfalusi was involved in every detail and even oversaw the dubbing of the final soundtrack . While Kricfalusi animated the 2D parts , he had John Kedzie to help him with the computer graphics and Sarah Harkey and Tommy Tanner to do the assistant animation .
