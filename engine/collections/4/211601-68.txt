Isabella Biedenharn of Entertainment Weekly gave the film a `` B '' grade , saying `` ... plot is n't really the point . The fun is in the roll call ... It 's no High School Musical , but the songs are catchy , and the junior villains are worth rooting for . '' Tisha Mae Eaton of Moviepilot.com stated , `` It 's a movie that definitely had the feel of a Disney classic with a modern twist and I highly recommend it . '' Alex Reif of LaughingPlace.com gave it a score of 4.5 out of 5 saying , `` ... I highly recommend this to any Disney fan , if for no other reason than to see what they 've done with the characters , the Hocus Pocus references , and Kristin Chenoweth 's Maleficent which is closer to the animated character than Angelina Jolie 's portrayal . '' Brian Lowry of Variety called it `` ... a playful and tuneful TV movie , exhibiting much higher ambitions than , say , the Teen Beach franchise . '' By contrast , Amy Amatangelo of The Hollywood Reporter gave it a mixed review , calling it `` High School Musical meets Once Upon a Time . It smartly ushers little girls who have grown up watching Disney movies into the tween audience and is an idea so ripe for merchandising that the Disney Store is already chock - full of Descendants costumes , dolls and T - shirts . '' She called the story `` flimsy '' , but singled out the performances of Chenoweth , Najimy , Robinson and Jobrani .
