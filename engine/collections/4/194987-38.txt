Both survivors and killers are able to unlock items , perks , and offerings through the Bloodweb . Every action performed in a match gives the player a number of Bloodpoints , and the sum are added to the player 's total at the end of the match . Each level of the Bloodweb is procedurally generated , and gets larger as the character gains levels . The rewards are connected to each other in a radial tree , and players must purchase rewards along the progression path to gain access to others . Once every reward on the tree has been purchased , the Bloodweb will generate a new level for the player to progress to , increasing that character 's level . Once the character reaches level 50 they will be given the option to prestige . While given the option , they will still be able to buy things from the blood web but will not increase their level . Once prestiged , characters will reset their level , items , offerings , and addons in exchange for a better chance for rarer items in the bloodweb and a bloody coat ( prestige one ) , bloody trousers or weapon for killer ( prestige two ) , and a bloody face ( prestige three ) . These effects are irreversible and can not be undone .
