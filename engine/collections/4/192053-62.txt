The Joker is portrayed as having no fear ; when fellow supervillain Scarecrow doses him with fear toxin in Knightfall ( 1993 ) , the Joker merely laughs and says , `` Boo ! '' . The villain has been temporarily rendered sane by several means , including telepathic manipulation by the Martian Manhunter and being resurrected in a life - restoring Lazarus Pit ( an experience typically inducing temporary insanity in the subject ) . At these moments , the Joker is depicted as expressing remorse for his acts ; however , during a medically induced period of partial sanity in Batman : Cacophony he tells his opponent : `` I do n't hate you ' cause I 'm crazy . I 'm crazy ' cause I hate you , '' and confirms that he will only stop murdering when Batman is dead .
