The Epicureans and the Cynics rejected public offices and civic service , which amounted to a rejection of the polis itself , the defining institution of the Greek world . Epicurus promoted atomism and an asceticism based on freedom from pain as its ultimate goal . Cynics such as Diogenes of Sinope rejected all material possessions and social conventions ( nomos ) as unnatural and useless . The Cyrenaics , meanwhile , embraced hedonism , arguing that pleasure was the only true good . Stoicism , founded by Zeno of Citium , taught that virtue was sufficient for eudaimonia as it would allow one to live in accordance with Nature or Logos . Zeno became extremely popular ; the Athenians set up a gold statue of him , and Antigonus II Gonatas invited him to the Macedonian court . The philosophical schools of Aristotle ( the Peripatetics of the Lyceum ) and Plato ( Platonism at the Academy ) also remained influential . The academy would eventually turn to Academic Skepticism under Arcesilaus until it was rejected by Antiochus of Ascalon ( c. 90 BC ) in favour of Neoplatonism . Hellenistic philosophy had a significant influence on the Greek ruling elite . Examples include Athenian statesman Demetrius of Phaleron , who had studied in the lyceum ; the Spartan king Cleomenes III , who was a student of the Stoic Sphairos of Borysthenes ; and Antigonus II , who was also a well known Stoic . This can also be said of the Roman upper classes , where Stoicism was dominant , as seen in the Meditations of the Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius and the works of Cicero .
