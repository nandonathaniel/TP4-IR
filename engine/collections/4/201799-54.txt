Despite these guarantees of confidentiality , the Census Bureau has some history of disclosures to other government agencies . In 1918 , the Census Bureau released individual information regarding several hundred young men to the Justice Department and Selective Service system for the purpose of prosecutions for draft evasion . During World War II , the United States Census Bureau assisted the government 's Japanese American internment efforts by providing confidential neighborhood information on Japanese - Americans . The Bureau 's role was denied for decades but was finally proven in 2007 .
