A pair of nearly 300 ft ( 91 m ) - tall arches spans the length of the stadium dome , anchored to the ground at each end . The new stadium also includes `` more than 3,000 Sony LCD displays throughout the luxury suites , concourses , concession areas and more , offering fans viewing options that extend beyond the action on the field '' . It also houses a center - hung Mitsubishi video display board that was the largest high - definition television screen in the world at the time of their installation . It has since been surpassed in size by the Panasonic `` Big Hoss '' video board ( 218 feet ( 66 m ) wide and 94.6 feet ( 28.8 m ) tall ) at Texas Motor Speedway . Glass doors , allowing each end zone to be opened , were designed and constructed by Dallas - based Haley - Greer glass systems .
