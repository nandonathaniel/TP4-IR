The area used by pitchers and catchers to warm up before taking the mound when play has already begun . This area is usually off to the side along either the left or right base line , or behind an outfield fence . It is almost never in fair territory , presumably due to the risk of interference with live action . A rare exception was at New York 's Polo Grounds where the bullpens were in the deep left and right center field quarter - circles of the outfield wall . A team 's relief pitching corps ( so named because the relievers are in the bullpen during games ) .
