In October 1935 , Manuel L. Quezon was elected the first President of the Commonwealth of the Philippines , which had been established , still under United States sovereignty , under a constitution ratified on 14 May of that year . During its first five years , the President could serve for an unrenewable six - year term . It was later amended in 1940 to limit a President to serving no more than two four - year terms . When President Quezon exiled himself to the United States after the Philippines fell to the Empire of Japan in World War II , he appointed Chief Justice Jos√© Abad Santos as Acting President and as Acting Commander - in Chief of the Armed Forces . Abad Santos was subsequently executed by the Imperial Japanese Army on May 2 , 1942 .
