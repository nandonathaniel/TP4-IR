Standiford Field was built by the Army Corps of Engineers in 1941 on a parcel of land south of Louisville that was found not to have flooded during the Ohio River flood of 1937 . It was named for Dr. Elisha David Standiford , a local businessman and politician , who was active in transportation issues and owned part of the land . The field remained under Army control until 1947 , when it was turned over to the Louisville Air Board for commercial operations .
