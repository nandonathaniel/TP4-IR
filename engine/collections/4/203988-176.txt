A number of changes to the qualifying system came into effect for the 2015 championship . All living world champions would be extended an opportunity to play in the qualifying rounds . The top 16 seeds would still qualify automatically for the first round at the Crucible , but all non-seeded players would have to start in the first of three qualifying rounds . Previously players seeded 17 to 32 only had to win one qualifying match to reach the final stages . The overall championship would increase from 128 to 144 players , with the additional places made available to former world champions and players from emerging countries .
