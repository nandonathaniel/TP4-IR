On one account , sustainability `` concerns the specification of a set of actions to be taken by present persons that will not diminish the prospects of future persons to enjoy levels of consumption , wealth , utility , or welfare comparable to those enjoyed by present persons '' . Sustainability interfaces with economics through the social and ecological consequences of economic activity . Sustainability economics represents : `` ... a broad interpretation of ecological economics where environmental and ecological variables and issues are basic but part of a multidimensional perspective . Social , cultural , health - related and monetary / financial aspects have to be integrated into the analysis . '' However , the concept of sustainability is much broader than the concepts of sustained yield of welfare , resources , or profit margins . At present , the average per capita consumption of people in the developing world is sustainable but population numbers are increasing and individuals are aspiring to high - consumption Western lifestyles . The developed world population is only increasing slightly but consumption levels are unsustainable . The challenge for sustainability is to curb and manage Western consumption while raising the standard of living of the developing world without increasing its resource use and environmental impact . This must be done by using strategies and technology that break the link between , on the one hand , economic growth and on the other , environmental damage and resource depletion .
