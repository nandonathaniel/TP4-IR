Dallara began producing Indycars for the 1997 season . The Dallara and G Force chassis were relatively evenly matched over their first few seasons , but eventually the Dallara began to win more races . This caused more teams to switch to the Dallara , further increasing their success . As of 2017 , a Dallara chassis has been used by 17 Indy 500 winners , although there have not been any competing manufacturers since 2012 . Dallara was also tabbed to build the Firestone Indy Lights machines . After the withdrawal of factory support from Panoz Auto Development , they are the only supplier of new chassis .
