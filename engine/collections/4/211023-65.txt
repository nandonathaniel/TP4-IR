13 October 1962 marked the initial working session of the Council . That day 's agenda included the election for members of the ten conciliar commissions . Each would have sixteen elected and eight appointed members , and were expected to do most of the work of the Council . It had been expected that the members of the preparatory commissions , where the Curia was heavily represented , would be confirmed as the majorities on the conciliar commissions . Senior French Cardinal Achille Li√©nart addressed the Council , saying that the bishops could not intelligently vote for strangers . He asked that the vote be postponed to give all the bishops a chance to draw up their own lists . German Cardinal Josef Frings seconded that proposal , and the vote was postponed . The first meeting of the Council adjourned after only fifteen minutes .
