Nuggets are gold fragments weathered out of an original lode . They often show signs of abrasive polishing by stream action , and sometimes still contain inclusions of quartz or other lode matrix material . A 2007 study on Australian nuggets ruled out speculative theories of supergene formation via in - situ precipitation , cold welding of smaller particles , or bacterial concentration , since crystal structures of all of the nuggets examined proved they were originally formed at high temperature deep underground ( i.e. , they were of hypogene origin ) .
