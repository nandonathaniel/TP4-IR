Although released years apart , and unrelated in terms of plot , characters , crew , or even production studios , Carpenter considers The Thing to be the first installment in his `` Apocalypse Trilogy '' , a series of films based around cosmic horror , entities unknown to man , that are threats to both human life and the sense of self . The Thing was followed by Prince of Darkness in 1987 , and In the Mouth of Madness in 1995 . All three films are heavily influenced by Carpenter 's appreciation for the works of H.P. Lovecraft .
