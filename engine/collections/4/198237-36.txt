The 1974 -- 75 season saw another change to the playoff system to accommodate a league that had expanded to 18 teams in two conferences and four divisions . Under this system , 12 teams qualified for the playoffs . The top team from each division would earn a bye to the quarterfinal , while the second - and third - place teams from each division started their playoff run from a best - of - three preliminary round . In each round of the playoffs , the teams remaining were seeded regardless of divisional or conference alignment , with the preliminary - round series being a best - of - three affair while the remainder of the series remained best - of - seven . The 1977 -- 78 season had one minor change in its playoff format : although the second - place finishers from each division would qualify for the preliminary round , the four playoff spots reserved for the third - place teams were replaced by four wild - card spots -- spots for the four teams with the highest regular - season point total that did not finish first or second in their divisions .
