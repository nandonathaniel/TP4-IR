Visiting the neighboring tribes to enter into non-aggression treaty with them to secure Medina from their attacks . Blocking or intercepting the trading caravans of the Quraysh to compel them into a compromise with the Muslims . As these trading enterprises were the main strength of the Quraysh , Muhammad employed this strategy to reduce their strength . Sending small scouting parties to gather intelligence about Quraysh movement , and also to facilitate the evacuation of those Muslims who were still suffering in Mecca and could not migrate to Medina because of their poverty or any other reason . It is in this connection that the following verse of the Quran was revealed : `` And why should you not fight in the cause of God and for those who , being weak , are ill - treated ( and oppressed ) ? Men , women , and children , whose cry is : `` Our Lord ! Rescue us from this town , whose people are oppressors ; and raise for us from Thee one who will protect ; and raise for us from Thee one who will help ! '' '' ( Quran 4 : 75 ) .
