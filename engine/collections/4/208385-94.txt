The WHL folded in 1926 , and its assets were bought by the NHL . This left the NHL as the only league left competing for the Cup . Other leagues and clubs have issued challenges , but from that year forward , no non-NHL team has played for it , leading it to become the de facto championship trophy of the NHL . In 1947 , the NHL reached an agreement with trustees P.D. Ross and Cooper Smeaton to grant control of the cup to the NHL , allowing the league itself to reject challenges from other leagues that may have wished to play for the Cup . A 2006 Ontario Superior Court case found that the trustees had gone against Lord Stanley 's conditions in the 1947 agreement . The NHL has agreed to allow other teams to play for the Cup should the league not be operating , as was the case in the 2004 -- 05 NHL lockout .
