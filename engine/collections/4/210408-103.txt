Truman 's first choice for his running mate was Supreme Court Justice William O. Douglas , hoping that it might make the ticket more appealing to liberals . Douglas refused the nomination . Needing an alternative , Truman then selected Senator Alben W. Barkley from Kentucky , who had delivered the convention 's keynote address , as his running mate , with this nomination being made by acclamation . Truman gave a fighting acceptance speech , stating that `` Senator Barkley and I will win this election and make the Republicans like it - do n't you forget it ! ... We will do that because they are wrong and we are right . '' He claimed that the Republican Party had , `` ever since its inception ... been under the control of special privilege ; and they have completely proved it in the Eightieth Congress . '' At the end of the speech the `` delegates rose to their feet and cheered loudly for two minutes ... for a moment Truman had created the illusion - few regarded it as more than an illusion - that the Democrats had a fighting chance in November .
