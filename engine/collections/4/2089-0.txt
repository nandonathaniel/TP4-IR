Empiricism is a theory that states that knowledge comes only or primarily from sensory experience . It is one of several views of epistemology , the study of human knowledge , along with rationalism and skepticism . Empiricism emphasizes the role of empirical evidence in the formation of ideas , over the idea of innate ideas or traditions ; empiricists may argue however that traditions ( or customs ) arise due to relations of previous sense experiences .
