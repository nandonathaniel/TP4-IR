Out - of - work actor Charlie Moore began the first season as a substitute teacher , but warmed to the IHP class immediately , making it his mission to get them to think rather than merely to know . Although they are gifted academically , the IHP students had plenty of problems in their personal lives , and Mr. Moore not only is there to listen , he shows an unswerving ability to get the students to solve their own problems while making it seem like they came up with the answers on their own . By Episode 6 ( `` Teacher 's Teacher '' ) , the class 's original teacher Mr. Thomas ( Roscoe Lee Browne ) had returned to Fillmore High , seemingly ready to return to the IHP class once Mr. Moore 's tenure ended . After observing Mr. Moore 's unorthodox teaching methods for most of the episode ( much to Charlie 's chagrin , as it also made apparent how much he would miss the IHP students ) , Mr. Thomas ultimately reveals he had no intention to return but came to observe Mr. Moore after hearing concerns about him from Dr. Samuels . Seeing Mr. Moore in action , Mr. Thomas gives him his blessing , leaving Mr. Moore to become their full - time teacher , knowing the IHP will be in good hands . Throughout the first season , Mr. Moore attempted to get the class involved in more than just their studies , encouraging them to play volleyball and make a music video for the school 's time capsule ( this marks the first foray into the fondness of Head of the Class for musical production numbers ) . At the same time , the class brought Mr. Moore into the present , acclimating him to the importance of personal computers . Near the end of the season , the IHP faces their Russian counterparts in an academic tournament , foreshadowing their famous trip to Moscow in season three .
