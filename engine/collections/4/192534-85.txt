Introduced in chapter six , he actually dislikes the name `` Cartaphilius '' and prefers to be called Joseph ( ヨセフ , Yosefu ) , and is known also as the Wandering Jew , or the `` Magician of the Flow '' . He is a mysterious being that looks like a young boy , but is much older , so old that he even refers to Ainsworth as `` little boy '' . A long time ago , people said that `` God 's Son '' cast an immortal curse on him for mocking him during the crucifixion , ( much like Gestas ) ; it 's said his immortality will last until Judgement Day . Holding no clear intention , he 's just a monster that simply does what he feels like and travels around the world experimenting with the living and dead for no clear reason . He has the appearance of a human but the body of a non-human -- as seen in chapter eleven when he was struck with a magic bullet . He claims his non-human body experiences constant pain and his one true desire is to be able to live without suffering .
