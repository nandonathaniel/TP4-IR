QUANGO : ' Quasi-autonomous NGO , ' such as the International Organization for Standardization ( ISO ) . ( The ISO is actually not purely an NGO , since its membership is by nation , and each nation is represented by what the ISO Council determines to be the ' most broadly representative ' standardization body of a nation . That body might itself be a non-governmental organization ; for example , the United States is represented in ISO by the American National Standards Institute , which is independent of the federal government . However , other countries can be represented by national governmental agencies ; this is the trend in Europe . )
