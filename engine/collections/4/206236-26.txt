People with atopic diseases such as asthma , eczema , or allergic rhinitis are at high risk of anaphylaxis from food , latex , and radiocontrast agents but not from injectable medications or stings . One study in children found that 60 % had a history of previous atopic diseases , and of children who die from anaphylaxis , more than 90 % have asthma . Those with mastocytosis or of a higher socioeconomic status are at increased risk . The longer the time since the last exposure to the agent in question , the lower the risk .
