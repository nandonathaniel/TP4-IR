The Lecompton Constitution and Dred Scott v. Sandford ( sic ) -- Sanford : the defendant 's name was misspelled in the reports -- were both part of the Bleeding Kansas controversy over slavery as a result of the Kansas -- Nebraska Act , which was Stephen Douglas ' attempt at replacing the Missouri Compromise ban on slavery in the Kansas and Nebraska territories with popular sovereignty , which meant that the people of a territory could vote either for or against slavery . The Lecompton Constitution , which would have allowed slavery in Kansas , was the result of massive vote fraud by the pro-slavery Border Ruffians . Douglas defeated the Lecompton Constitution because it was supported by the minority of pro-slavery people in Kansas , and Douglas believed in majority rule . Douglas hoped that both South and North would support popular sovereignty , but the opposite was true . Neither side trusted Douglas .
