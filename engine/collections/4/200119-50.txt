Sindh 's capital , Karachi , is Pakistan 's most ethnically diverse city , with Muhajirs , or descendants of those who migrated to Pakistan from India after 1947 and throughout the 1950s and 1960s , making up the majority of the population . Karachi and other urban centres of Sindh have seen ethnic tensions between the native Sindhis and the Muhajirs boil over into violence on several occasions . Sindh is home to two UNESCO World Heritage Sites -- the Historical Monuments at Makli , and the Archaeological Ruins at Moenjodaro .
