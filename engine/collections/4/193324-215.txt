The practice of slavery in Achaemenid Persia was generally banned , although there is evidence that conquered and / or rebellious armies were sold into captivity . The kings of Achaemenid Persia , especially the founder Cyrus the Great , occasionally declined to adopt slavery , as evidenced by the freeing of the Jews at Babylon , and the construction of Persepolis by paid workers .
