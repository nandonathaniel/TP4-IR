Cyanoacrylate glue has a low shearing strength , which has led to its use as a temporary adhesive in cases where the piece needs to be sheared off later . Common examples include mounting a workpiece to a sacrificial glue block on a lathe , and tightening pins and bolts . It is also used in conjunction with another , slower , but more resilient adhesive as way of rapidly forming a joint , which then holds the pieces in the appropriate configuration until the second adhesive has set .
