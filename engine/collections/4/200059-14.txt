The first performance of the Water Music suites is recorded in The Daily Courant , the first British daily newspaper . At about 8 p.m. on Wednesday , 17 July 1717 , King George I and several aristocrats boarded a royal barge at Whitehall Palace , for an excursion up the Thames toward Chelsea . The rising tide propelled the barge upstream without rowing . Another barge , provided by the City of London , contained about 50 musicians who performed Handel 's music . Many other Londoners also took to the river to hear the concert . According to The Courant , `` the whole River in a manner was covered '' with boats and barges . On arriving at Chelsea , the king left his barge , then returned to it at about 11 p.m. for the return trip . The king was so pleased with the Water Music that he ordered it to be repeated at least three times , both on the trip upstream to Chelsea and on the return , until he landed again at Whitehall .
