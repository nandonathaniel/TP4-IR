Publius Scipio , one of the consuls for 218 BC , received orders from the Senate to confront Hannibal in the theatre of the Ebro or the Pyrenees . The Senate delegated to him 60 ships for this purpose . However , he did not move with the speed that the issue required of him . When he arrived in the Po area , there was an uprising amongst the freshly conquered Gauls . More colonies were being established in the Po region , and this caused the Boii and Insubres to arise afresh who were now aware that Hannibal was heading to them . Instead of employing the legions that were on hand for their intended Iberian expedition , the Senate ordered that they should be sent to the Po under the command of a Praetor and new legions should be levied by the consul . The formation of a new army was a fairly easy matter for the Romans . There were so many citizens who were qualified for service in the army that all the government had to do was inform the citizenry that more soldiers were needed and they would be required to serve . Many Romans , being required to serve at some point , spent portions of their youth training to serve in the legions .
