Ninety - four percent of the more than 630,000 people affected by the flood lived in the states of Arkansas , Mississippi , and Louisiana , most in the Mississippi Delta . More than 200,000 African Americans were displaced from their homes along the Lower Mississippi River and had to live for lengthy periods in relief camps . As a result of this disruption , many joined the Great Migration from the south to northern and midwestern industrial cities rather than return to rural agricultural labor . This massive population movement increased from World War II until 1970 .
