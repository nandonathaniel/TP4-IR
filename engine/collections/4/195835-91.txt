As some of you may know , pictures and screen grabs of The Twilight Saga : Breaking Dawn as a work in progress have leaked on the internet . We are extremely proud of this film and also extremely heartbroken to see it out there at this stage . The film and these images are not yet ready or in their proper context . They were illegally obtained and their early dissemination is deeply upsetting to the actors , the filmmakers and Summit who are working so hard to bring these movies to fruition to you in November 2011 and November 2012 .
