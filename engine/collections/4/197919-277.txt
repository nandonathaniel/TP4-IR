To coincide with the 60th anniversary of the Ballon d'Or in 2016 , France Football published a reevaluation of the awards presented before 1995 , when only European players were eligible to win the award . 12 out of the 39 Ballons d'Or presented during this time period would have been awarded to South American players ; in addition to Pelé and Diego Maradona , Garrincha , Mario Kempes , and Romário were retrospectively recognized as worthy winners . The original recipients , however , remain unchanged . Maradona and Pelé received honorary Ballons d'Or for their services to football in 1996 and 2013 , respectively .
