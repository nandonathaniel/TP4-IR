Skis are lighter , narrower and designed to be faster than those used in recreational cross-country skiing and made of composite materials . For classic events , typical ski lengths are between 195 and 210 centimetres , while ski lengths for skating are 170 to 200 cm . Skis for skating are also more rigid than skis for classical . Skis are waxed for speed and , in the case of classic skis , traction when striding forward . Racing ski boots are also lighter than recreational ones and are attached at the toe only to bindings that are specialized for classic or skate skiing .
