The iron ion may be either in the Fe or in the Fe state , but ferrihemoglobin ( methemoglobin ) ( Fe ) can not bind oxygen . In binding , oxygen temporarily and reversibly oxidizes ( Fe ) to ( Fe ) while oxygen temporarily turns into the superoxide ion , thus iron must exist in the + 2 oxidation state to bind oxygen . If superoxide ion associated to Fe is protonated , the hemoglobin iron will remain oxidized and incapable of binding oxygen . In such cases , the enzyme methemoglobin reductase will be able to eventually reactivate methemoglobin by reducing the iron center .
