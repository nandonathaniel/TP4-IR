The usable model at hand , when Emperor Constantine I wanted to memorialize his imperial piety , was the familiar conventional architecture of the basilica . There were several variations of the basic plan of the secular basilica , always some kind of rectangular hall , but the one usually followed for churches had a center nave with one aisle at each side , and an apse at one end opposite to the main door at the other . In , and often also in front of , the apse was a raised platform , where the altar was placed and the clergy officiated . In secular buildings this plan was more typically used for the smaller audience halls of the emperors , governors , and the very rich than for the great public basilicas functioning as law courts and other public purposes . This was the normal pattern used for Roman churches , and generally in the Western Empire , but the Eastern Empire , and Roman Africa , were more adventurous , and their models were sometimes copied in the West , for example in Milan . All variations allowed natural light from windows high in the walls , a departure from the windowless sanctuaries of the temples of most previous religions , and this has remained a consistent feature of Christian church architecture . Formulas giving churches with a large central area were to become preferred in Byzantine architecture , which developed styles of basilica with a dome early on .
