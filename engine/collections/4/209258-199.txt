Two expansion teams have not yet won a league pennant ( and therefore also have not appeared in a World Series ) : the American League 's Seattle Mariners and the National League 's Washington Nationals ( formerly Montreal Expos ) . Both teams have competed in postseason play and appeared in their respective League Championship Series at least once , but have no League Championship Series victories .
