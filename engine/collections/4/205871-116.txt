As of 2017 a candidate for large - scale production of lithium - ion batteries such as electric vehicle applications is LiFePO due to its low cost , excellent safety , high cycle durability ( 74 % after 8000 , 100 % discharge for Sony Fortelion batteries ) and excellent performance , though a carbon conductive agent is required to overcome its low electrical conductivity .
