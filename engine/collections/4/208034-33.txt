On 9 November 2002 , City , managed by Kevin Keegan , won the last ever derby at Maine Road 3 -- 1 , with Shaun Goater scoring his 100th and 101st goals for the club , and Nicolas Anelka scoring the other . This was City 's first win over United since the 5 -- 1 victory in 1989 , ending a 13 - year barren run for the blue half of Manchester . City would later go on to draw at Old Trafford in the same season 1 -- 1 , Shaun Goater again scoring the goal . This was the first season since 1991 -- 92 that City had been unbeaten by United in either of their league meetings .
