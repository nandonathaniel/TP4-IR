shift -- a modifier key used to type capital letters and other alternate `` upper case '' characters ; when pressed and held down , would shift a typewriter 's mechanism to allow a different typebar impression ( such as ' D ' instead of ' d ' ) to press into the ribbon and print on a page . The concept of a shift key or modifier key was later extended to Ctrl , Alt , and Super ( `` Windows '' or `` Apple '' ) keys on modern computer keyboards . The generalized concept of a shift key reached its apotheosis in the MIT space - cadet keyboard .
