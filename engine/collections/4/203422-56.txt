Skin - prick testing is easy to do and results are available in minutes . Different allergists may use different devices for testing . Some use a `` bifurcated needle '' , which looks like a fork with two prongs . Others use a `` multitest '' , which may look like a small board with several pins sticking out of it . In these tests , a tiny amount of the suspected allergen is put onto the skin or into a testing device , and the device is placed on the skin to prick , or break through , the top layer of skin . This puts a small amount of the allergen under the skin . A hive will form at any spot where the person is allergic . This test generally yields a positive or negative result . It is good for quickly learning if a person is allergic to a particular food or not , because it detects IgE . Skin tests can not predict if a reaction would occur or what kind of reaction might occur if a person ingests that particular allergen . They can , however , confirm an allergy in light of a patient 's history of reactions to a particular food . Non-IgE - mediated allergies can not be detected by this method .
