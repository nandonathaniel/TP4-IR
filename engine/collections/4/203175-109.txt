A motif within the second season is the image of a damaged teddy bear and its missing eye . The teddy bear first appears at the end of the music video `` Fallacies '' for Jesse 's band `` TwaüghtHammër '' , which was released as a webisode in February 2009 leading to the second season . The teddy bear can also be spotted on the mural on Jane 's bedroom wall during the final episode of the second season , further connecting the crash to Jane . It is seen in flashforwards during four episodes , the titles of which , when put together in order , form the sentence `` Seven Thirty - Seven down over ABQ '' . The flashforwards are shot in black and white , with the sole exception of the pink teddy bear , which is an homage to the film Schindler 's List , in which the color red is used to distinguish a little girl in a coat . At the end of the season , Walter indirectly helps cause the midair collision of two airplanes ; the pink teddy bear is then revealed to have fallen out of one of the planes and into the Whites ' swimming pool . Vince Gilligan called the plane accident an attempt to visualize `` all the terrible grief that Walt has wrought upon his loved ones '' and `` the judgment of God '' .
