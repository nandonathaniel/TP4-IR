Derives from Qatara , believed to refer to the Qatari town of Zubara , an important trading port and town in the region in ancient times . The word `` Qatara '' first appeared on Ptolemy 's map of the Arab world . In the early 20th century , English speakers often pronounced Qatar as `` Cutter '' , close to the local pronunciation in Qatar . However , the traditional English pronunciation ( `` Kuh - tahr '' ) has prevailed .
