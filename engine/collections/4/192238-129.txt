In February 1957 , Elizabeth and Philip discuss the state of their marriage while onboard the Britannia in Lisbon , ultimately recognising that divorce is not an option . Five months earlier , as Philip prepares to embark on his royal tour , Elizabeth becomes convinced he is having an affair after finding a photograph of Russian ballerina Galina Ulanova in his briefcase . Chancellor of the Exchequer Harold Macmillan challenges Prime Minister Anthony Eden 's solution to Egypt nationalising the Suez Canal , but later agrees that the best course of action is military intervention . Philip 's uncle Louis Mountbatten overhears the plan and warns Elizabeth , who confronts Eden after hearing reports that Israel has invaded the Sinai Peninsula . Eden explains that the invasion was part of a secret plan spearheaded by Israel , France , and the United Kingdom to reclaim the canal and overthrow Egyptian President Nasser without support from Parliament or the United Nations . Elizabeth gives her support and allows British forces to begin launching air raids on Egypt before going to see Ulanova perform .
