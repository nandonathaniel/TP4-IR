On 10 August 2016 , it was announced that Sheeran was getting sued by the family of Ed Townsend for copyright infringement , who claim that `` Thinking Out Loud '' plagiarises elements of Marvin Gaye 's `` Let 's Get It On '' . The claim was voluntarily withdrawn , with the court later saying there was no grounds or evidence of plagiarism even if the claim should have been submitted further in the courts .
