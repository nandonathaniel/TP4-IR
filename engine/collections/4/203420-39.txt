Considering mass shooting alone ( four people shot dead in a public place ) , nearly all were male . About 47 % were white , 12 % black , and 6 % Asian ( 1982 - 2016 ) . However , this definition of `` mass shooting '' is contested by some . The mass shootings have represented 1 % of all deaths using gun between 1980 and 2008 .
