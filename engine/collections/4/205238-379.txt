The current monarch is King Willem - Alexander ( born 1967 ) , who has been on the Throne since 30 April 2013 . He studied history at the University of Leiden and became actively involved in water management . His wife is Queen Máxima ( née Máxima Zorreguieta Cerruti ) , an economics major , whose father was a minister of agriculture in the dictatorial regime under General Videla in Argentina . Because of that their relationship was accompanied by fierce public debate and only officially sanctioned after quiet diplomacy , resulting in Máxima 's father agreeing not to be present on their wedding day ( 2 February 2002 ) . Former minister Max van der Stoel and Prime Minister Wim Kok seem to have played a crucial role in this process .
