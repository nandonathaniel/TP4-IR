O - 11 was the temporary flag officer rank of fleet admiral ( five star ) . It was awarded to four officers during World War II , and has not been authorized since . However , the rank of fleet admiral of the United States Navy still remains listed on official rank insignia precedence charts and , if needed , this rank could be reestablished at the discretion of Congress and the president . All five - star officers are , technically , unable to retire from active duty . The last living fleet admiral of the United States Navy , Chester W. Nimitz , died in 1966 .
