Browser extensions are potential threats to the user privacy . By design , existing browsers ( e.g. , Firefox , Safari ) commonly choose to enable extensions in the private mode by default . This however allows an installed extension to secretly record the visited websites without the user 's awareness . Newer versions of Chrome disable extensions in the private mode by default , but allow the private and the normal modes to run in parallel . This makes it possible for an installed extension in the normal mode to learn the user activities in the private mode by measuring the usage of shared computing resources . Data erasure by the browser alone is found to be insufficient . For example , the records of visited websites during the private session can be retained in memory for a long time even after the private session is closed . In addition , the visited website records are usually kept by the operating system in the local DNS cache . Furthermore , the modified time stamps of certain profile files saved on the disk may reveal if the private mode was previously turned on and when it was turned on . Software bugs present in some browsers are found to seriously degrade the security of the private mode . For example , in some earlier versions of Safari , the browser retained private browsing history records if the browser program was not closed normally ( e.g. , as a result of program crash ) , or if the user acted to add a bookmark within the private mode . Depending on whether the session is in the private or the normal mode , web browsers typically exhibit different user interfaces and traffic characteristics . This allows a remote website to tell if the user is currently in the private mode , for example , by checking the color of the hyperlinks or measuring the time of writing cookies . ( The fact that the user is using the private mode should be considered protected information as well . )
