Forms of read - only memory were employed as non-volatile storage for programs in most early stored - program computers , such as ENIAC after 1948 . ( Until then it was not a stored - program computer as every program had to be manually wired into the machine , which could take days to weeks . ) Read - only memory was simpler to implement since it needed only a mechanism to read stored values , and not to change them in - place , and thus could be implemented with very crude electromechanical devices ( see historical examples below ) . With the advent of integrated circuits in the 1960s , both ROM and its mutable counterpart static RAM were implemented as arrays of transistors in silicon chips ; however , a ROM memory cell could be implemented using fewer transistors than an SRAM memory cell , since the latter needs a latch ( comprising 5 - 20 transistors ) to retain its contents , while a ROM cell might consist of the absence ( logical 0 ) or presence ( logical 1 ) of one transistor connecting a bit line to a word line . Consequently , ROM could be implemented at a lower cost - per - bit than RAM for many years .
