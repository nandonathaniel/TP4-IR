HMFGs were initially slated for optical fiber applications , because the intrinsic losses of a mid-IR fiber could in principle be lower than those of silica fibers , which are transparent only up to about 2 μm . However , such low losses were never realized in practice , and the fragility and high cost of fluoride fibers made them less than ideal as primary candidates . Later , the utility of fluoride fibers for various other applications was discovered . These include mid-IR spectroscopy , fiber optic sensors , thermometry , and imaging . Also , fluoride fibers can be used for guided lightwave transmission in media such as YAG ( yttrium aluminium garnet ) lasers at 2.9 μm , as required for medical applications ( e.g. ophthalmology and dentistry ) .
