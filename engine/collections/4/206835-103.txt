In South Dakota v. Dole ( 1987 ) , the Supreme Court upheld the withholding of some federal highway funds to South Dakota , because beer with an alcohol content below a specified percentage could be lawfully sold to adults under the age of 21 within the state . In a 7 -- 2 majority opinion by Chief Justice Rehnquist , the Court held that the offer of benefits is not coercion that inappropriately invades state sovereignty . The Twenty - first Amendment could not constitute an `` independent constitutional bar '' to the spending power granted to Congress under Article I , section 8 , clause 1 of the Constitution . Justice Brennan , author of the majority opinion in Craig v. Boren , provided a brief but notable dissent based solely on Section 2 . Justice O'Connor also dissented , arguing that `` the regulation of the age of the purchasers of liquor , just as the regulation of the price at which liquor may be sold , falls squarely within the scope of those powers reserved to the States by the Twenty - first Amendment .
