A production opened in Australia in 1992 and a short - lived London revival starring John Barrowman and Paul Hipp opened at the Old Vic in London in 1993 , directed by Michael Bogdanov . While the London production was faithful to the original , a member of the production staff said the reason it `` flopped '' was because the tribe consisted of `` Thatcher 's children who did n't really get it '' . Other productions were mounted around the world , including South Africa , where the show had been banned until the eradication of Apartheid . In 1996 , Butler brought a month - long production to Chicago , employing the Pacific Musical Theater , a professional troupe in residence at California State University , Fullerton . Butler ran the show concurrently with the 1996 Democratic National Convention , echoing the last time the DNC was in Chicago : 1968 . A 30th Anniversary Off - Off Broadway production was staged at Third Eye Repertory . It was directed by Shawn Rozsa .
