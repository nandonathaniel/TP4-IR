The earlier V1. 1 model of the Raspberry Pi 2 used a Broadcom BCM2836 SoC with a 900 MHz 32 - bit quad - core ARM Cortex - A7 processor , with 256 KB shared L2 cache . The Raspberry Pi 2 V1. 2 was upgraded to a Broadcom BCM2837 SoC with a 1.2 GHz 64 - bit quad - core ARM Cortex - A53 processor , the same SoC which is used on the Raspberry Pi 3 , but underclocked ( by default ) to the same 900 MHz CPU clock speed as the V1. 1 . The BCM2836 SoC is no longer in production ( as of late 2016 ) .
