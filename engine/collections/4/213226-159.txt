Although the royal family returned to Portugal in 1821 , the interlude led to a growing desire for independence amongst Brazilians . In 1822 , the son of Dom Jo√£o VI , then prince - regent Dom Pedro I , proclaimed the independence of Brazil on September 7 , 1822 , and was crowned Emperor of the new Empire of Brazil . Unlike the Spanish colonies of South America , Brazil 's independence was achieved without significant bloodshed .
