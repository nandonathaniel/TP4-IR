Police also often carry an impact weapon - a baton , also known as a nightstick . The common nightstick and the side handle baton have been replaced in many locations by expandable batons such as the Monadnock Auto - Lock Expandable Baton or ASP baton . One advantage of the collapsible baton is that the wearer can comfortably sit in a patrol vehicle while still wearing the baton on their duty belt . The side handle night stick usually has to be removed before entering the vehicle . Many departments also use less - lethal weapons like mace , pepper spray , electroshock guns , and beanbag shotgun rounds .
