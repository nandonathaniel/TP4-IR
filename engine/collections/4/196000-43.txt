On 15 March 1991 , the Treaty on the Final Settlement with Respect to Germany -- that had been signed in Moscow back on 12 September 1990 by the two German states that then existed ( East and West Germany ) on one side , and by the four principal Allied powers ( the United Kingdom , France , the Soviet Union and the United States ) on the other -- entered into force , having been ratified by the Federal Republic of Germany ( after the unification , as the united Germany ) and by the four Allied nations . The entry into force of that treaty ( also known as the `` Two Plus Four Treaty '' , in reference to the two German states and four Allied nations that signed it ) put an end to the then - remaining limitations on German sovereignty that resulted from the post World War II arrangements .
