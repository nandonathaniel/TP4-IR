Many incorporated unorganized territories became incorporated organized territories or states . For example , when the eastern part of the incorporated organized territory called Minnesota became the state of Minnesota in 1858 , the western part became part of an unorganized territory . Later , that became a part of the Dakota Territory , out of which two states and some parts of other states were created . California was part of an unorganized territory when it became a state . Currently , only Palmyra Atoll is incorporated and unorganized .
