Although the natural absorption of CO 2 by the world 's oceans helps mitigate the climatic effects of anthropogenic emissions of CO 2 , it is believed that the resulting decrease in pH will have negative consequences , primarily for oceanic calcifying organisms . These span the food chain from autotrophs to heterotrophs and include organisms such as coccolithophores , corals , foraminifera , echinoderms , crustaceans and molluscs . As described above , under normal conditions , calcite and aragonite are stable in surface waters since the carbonate ion is at supersaturating concentrations . However , as ocean pH falls , the concentration of carbonate ions required for saturation to occur increases , and when carbonate becomes undersaturated , structures made of calcium carbonate are vulnerable to dissolution . Therefore , even if there is no change in the rate of calcification , the rate of dissolution of calcareous material increases .
