In the United Kingdom , a number of varieties of loose tea sold in packets from the 1940s to the 1980s contained tea cards . These were illustrated cards roughly the same size as cigarette cards and intended to be collected by children . Perhaps the best known were Typhoo tea and Brooke Bond ( manufacturer of PG Tips ) , the latter of whom also provided albums for collectors to keep their cards in . In the brand named Brooke Bond Dividend D , the card was a dividend ( `` divvy '' ) against the cost of the tea .
