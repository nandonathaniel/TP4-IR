Though designed for Arkansas , Section 731 may also apply to Alaska and California whose constitutions provide for the same basic usury limit , though unlike Arkansas their legislatures can ( and generally do ) set different limits . If Section 731 applies to those states , then all their usury limits are inapplicable to banks based in those states , since Wells Fargo has branches in both states .
