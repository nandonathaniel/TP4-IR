Swedish columnist Lars Lindstrom commented positively about PewDiePie , stating , `` that Felix Kjellberg has a comic talent is indisputable . It is both amazingly awful and amazingly funny when a father bikes around with his son in the game Happy Wheels and both get crushed and bloody again and again and PewDiePie improvises absurd comments as the game continues . The secret is that he really loves to play these games and that he has fun doing it . '' PewDiePie has also been received negatively by the media on some occasions , often being reported as an `` inexplicable phenomenon . '' Andrew Wallenstein of Variety heavily criticised PewDiePie , following his channel becoming the most subscribed channel on YouTube , describing his videos as `` aggressive stupidity '' and `` psycho babble .
