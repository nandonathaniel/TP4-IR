As the Army moved into the field on its expedition , it was operating with incorrect assumptions as to the number of Indians it would encounter . These assumptions were based on inaccurate information provided by the Indian Agents that no more than 800 hostiles were in the area . The Indian Agents based this estimate on the number of Lakota that Sitting Bull and other leaders had reportedly led off the reservation in protest of U.S. government policies . It was in fact a correct estimate until several weeks before the battle , when the `` reservation Indians '' joined Sitting Bull 's ranks for the summer buffalo hunt . The agents did not take into account the many thousands of these `` reservation Indians '' who had unofficially left the reservation to join their `` uncooperative non-reservation cousins led by Sitting Bull '' . Thus , Custer unknowingly faced thousands of Indians , including the 800 non-reservation `` hostiles '' . All Army plans were based on the incorrect numbers . Although Custer was severely criticized after the battle for not having accepted reinforcements and for dividing his forces , it must be understood that he had accepted the same official government estimates of hostiles in the area which Terry and Gibbon had also accepted . Historian James Donovan states that when Custer asked interpreter Fred Gerard for his opinion on the size of the opposition , he estimated the force at between 1,500 to 2,500 warriors .
