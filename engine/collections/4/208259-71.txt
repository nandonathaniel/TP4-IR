In 1972 , the Dolphins completed the only fully undefeated season in the NFL , winning all 14 regular season games , two playoff games and Super Bowl VII , defeating the Washington Redskins 14 -- 7 . They finished the season 17 - 0 , and are the only team to complete an undefeated season and win the NFL title . QB Bob Griese was victim to a broken leg and dislocated ankle in Week 5 versus the San Diego Chargers and was replaced by veteran Earl Morrall for the rest of the regular season , but returned to the field as a substitute during the AFC Championship game versus the Pittsburgh Steelers and then started in Super Bowl VII . The Dolphins set the NFL single - season rushing record , and running backs Csonka and Mercury Morris became the first teammates to each rush for 1,000 yards in a season . The offensive line included future Hall of Fame members Jim Langer and Larry Little and Pro Bowler Bob Kuechenberg . The 1972 Dolphins defensive unit , called the No - Name Defense because Miami 's impressive offense received much more publicity , was the league 's best that year . It was led by linebacker Nick Buoniconti , end Bill Stanfill , tackle Manny Fernandez and safeties Dick Anderson and Jake Scott . They secured the team rushing record by averaging more than 200 yards per game on the ground for an entire season , while the defense allowed only 171 points .
