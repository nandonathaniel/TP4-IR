Asda was also the first supermarket chain in the United Kingdom to sell petrol at its old Halifax store in 1967 , which at the time was located inside a converted mill in Battinson Road which burnt down during a major fire in 1982 , and subsequently reopened as a purpose - built store in 1983 , but it no longer offered a petrol station . The store moved to a different site in 2004 . Back then its forecourt fuel was supplied by discount Russian supplier Nafta , because the major oil companies would not supply fuel to be sold at discount prices . From the early seventies , oil companies such as Mobil , Shell and Texaco supplied fuel to Asda as more supermarkets started to sell fuel from car park forecourts . Since the mid-1990s Asda has supplied , along with its main supermarket rivals , its own fuel delivered by its own tankers to its petrol station forecourts . Since September 2017 , Asda operated 308 petrol stations in total , most within the car park area of its stores . And , as of 22 September 2017 , that includes 21 standalone petrol stations .
