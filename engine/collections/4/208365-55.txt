Great Britain established a small colony in 1805 . It used Dominica as part of the triangular trade , by which slaves were brought to the islands as part of a trade that included shipping sugar and coffee to Europe . The best documented slave estate on the island is Hillsborough Estate , which had 71 male and 68 female slaves . The Greg family were notable : Thomas Hodgson , a brother - in - law , owned a slave ship , and Thomas Greg and his son John Greg part owned sugar plantations on Dominica . In January 1814 , 20 slaves absconded . They were recorded as recaptured and punished with 100 lashes applied to the males and 50 for the females . The slaves believed that one of their people had died in the plantation hospital , and they believed he had been poisoned .
