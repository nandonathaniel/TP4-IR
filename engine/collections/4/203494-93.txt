A digitally rejuvenated Patrick Stewart also makes an uncredited cameo as a younger Charles Xavier who appeared to not yet lose the use of his legs . However , with timeline and story inconsistencies within the film series , Singer developed an idea to tie all the films together and fix the continuity . In X-Men : First Class Xavier loses the use of his legs at a much younger age , than he appears in Origins . As an explanation , Xavier can be seen walking in X-Men : Days of Future Past ( which chronologically takes place prior to the events of this film ) , by creating the illusion that he is standing in various scenes , when in reality the character is only present by telepathic projection .
