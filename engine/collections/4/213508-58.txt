A state of national emergency has an adverse effect on these rights . Under such a state , the rights conferred by Article 19 ( freedoms of speech , assembly and movement , etc . ) remain suspended . Hence , in such a situation , the legislature may make laws that go against the rights given in Article 19 . Also , the President may by order suspend the right to move court for the enforcement of other rights as well .
