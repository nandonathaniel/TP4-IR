The Young Lords were working within their communities to provide resources that they felt were withheld from them , similar to the Brown Berets and the Black Panther Party . Their overall goals were to demonstrate efforts that would help others become aware of the oppression they were facing , as well as helping others understand the struggle of many Puerto Rican men and women , while teaching the history behind the movement . The book The Young Lords : A Reader ( 2010 ) , edited by Darrel Enck - Wanzer ( see external links below for the full text of that book ) explains the purpose , goals , and tactics of the Young Lords New York chapter : `` Puerto Ricans have suffered as a group , racially and culturally , not as individuals . Therefore the fight against amerikkkanism must be a group struggle '' ( Darrel Enck - Wanzer , p. 134 ) . Through this passage , the author is trying to convey his deeper message that Puerto Ricans have been oppressed overall as a group , and that each person that identifies as Puerto Ricans has suffered , while feeling the pain for their fellow Puerto Rican brothers , sisters , friends , and close relatives . Puerto Ricans must fight for their nation against American colonialism and to empower its people who live in the diaspora by organizing and educating those in the barrios . They also need to be made aware about the repression that took place in Chicago while the Young Lords were being formed in the neighborhood of Lincoln Park .
