On November 13 , 2006 , it was announced that the ballpark would be called Citi Field , named for Citigroup Inc . Citigroup will be paying $20 million a year for the naming rights to the park over the next 20 years . This made Citi Field the second major league sports venue in the New York metropolitan area and the first in the city itself to be named for a corporate sponsor . At the time , the Meadowlands Arena in New Jersey 's Meadowlands Sports Complex had carried the Continental Airlines name ; since then Prudential Center in Newark , MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford , Red Bull Arena in Harrison , and Barclays Center in Brooklyn have all opened under corporate sponsorship . The deal includes an option on both sides to extend the contract to 40 years , and is the most expensive sports - stadium naming rights agreement ever , subsequently equaled by MetLife Stadium 's $400 million deal .
