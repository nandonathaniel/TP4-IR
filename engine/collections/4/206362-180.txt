In presentations of the periodic table , the lanthanides and the actinides are customarily shown as two additional rows below the main body of the table , with placeholders or else a selected single element of each series ( either lanthanum or lutetium , and either actinium or lawrencium , respectively ) shown in a single cell of the main table , between barium and hafnium , and radium and rutherfordium , respectively . This convention is entirely a matter of aesthetics and formatting practicality ; a rarely used wide - formatted periodic table inserts the lanthanide and actinide series in their proper places , as parts of the table 's sixth and seventh rows ( periods ) .
