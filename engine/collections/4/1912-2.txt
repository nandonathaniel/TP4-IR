The superstition surrounding this day may have arisen in the Middle Ages , `` originating from the story of Jesus ' last supper and crucifixion '' in which there were 13 individuals present in the Upper Room on the 13th of Nisan Maundy Thursday , the night before his death on Good Friday . While there is evidence of both Friday and the number 13 being considered unlucky , there is no record of the two items being referred to as especially unlucky in conjunction before the 19th century .
