Dorothy 's character was probably named after Baum 's own niece , Dorothy Louise Gage , who died in infancy . Baum 's wife was very attached to her and was deeply grieved by her death , so there is speculation that Baum inserted her name into his stories as a memorial . Elements of Dorothy Gale 's character are possibly derived from Matilda Joslyn Gage , Dorothy Gage 's grandmother . Dorothy Gage is buried in Evergreen Cemetery in Bloomington , Illinois .
