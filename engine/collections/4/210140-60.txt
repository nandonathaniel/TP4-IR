The story 's keynote aphorism , On ne voit bien qu'avec le cœur . L'essentiel est invisible pour les yeux ( `` One sees clearly only with the heart . What is essential is invisible to the eye '' ) was reworded and rewritten some 15 times before achieving its final phrasing . Saint - Exupéry also used his newly purchased $700 Dictaphone recorder to produce oral drafts for his typist . His initial 30,000 word working manuscript was distilled to less than half its original size through laborious editing sessions . Multiple versions of its many pages were created and its prose then polished over several drafts , with the author occasionally telephoning friends at 2 : 00 a.m. to solicit opinions on his newly written passages .
