Athena Parthenos ( Ancient Greek : Ἀθηνᾶ Παρθένος ; literally , `` Athena the Virgin '' ) is a lost massive chryselephantine ( gold and ivory ) sculpture of the Greek goddess Athena , made by Phidias and his assistants and housed in the Parthenon in Athens . Despite the dynamic architectural characteristics of the Parthenon , the statue of Athena was designed to be the focal point . Its epithet was an essential character of the goddess herself . A number of replicas and works inspired by it , both ancient and modern , have been made .
