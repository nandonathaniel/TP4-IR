The great Italian painters of the Renaissance made comparatively few formal painted self - portraits , but often included themselves in larger works . Most individual self - portraits they have left were straightforward depictions ; DÃ¼rer 's showmanship was rarely followed , although a controversially attributed Self - portrait as David by Giorgione would have something of the same spirit , if it is a self - portrait . There is a portrait by Pietro Perugino of about 1500 ( Collegio del Cambio of Perugia ) , and one by the young Parmigianino showing the view in a convex mirror . There is also a drawing by Leonardo da Vinci ( 1512 ) , and self - portraits in larger works by Michelangelo , who gave his face to the skin of St. Bartholomew in the Last Judgement of the Sistine Chapel ( 1536 -- 1541 ) , and Raphael who is seen in the characters of School of Athens 1510 , or with a friend who holds his shoulder ( 1518 ) . Also notable are two portraits of Titian as an old man in the 1560s . Paolo Veronese appears as a violinist clothed in white in his Marriage at Cana , accompanied by Titian on the bass viol ( 1562 ) . Northern artists continued to make more individual portraits , often looking very much like their other bourgeois sitters . Johan Gregor van der Schardt produced a painted terracotta bust of himself ( c. 1573 ) .
