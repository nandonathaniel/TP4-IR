Darth Sidious ( Sheev Palpatine ) was a male human Dark Lord of the Sith who appeared in the first six Star Wars saga films . Originally the oldest son of an aristocratic family from the planet Naboo , he rose to power within the Galactic Republic 's government system starting from Senator of his homeworld , then to Supreme Chancellor of the Republic , and finally to self - proclaimed Emperor of the Galactic Empire . This was done by cultivating a public image as a humble and competent politician while secretly mastering dark Sith arts and planning the destruction of the Jedi Order and Republic . Eventually , by manipulating disaffected political groups and using double agents to sow discord , Palpatine fomented a civil war that provided an opportunity for him to seize absolute power . He had three known `` Shadow Hands '' ( Sith apprentices ) : Darth Maul , Darth Tyranus and Darth Vader . He was eventually killed by his last , Vader , at the end of Return of the Jedi .
