The optimal value of the objective is weakly smaller as additional columns of X ( \ displaystyle X ) are added , by the fact that less constrained minimization leads to an optimal cost which is weakly smaller than more constrained minimization does . Given the previous conclusion and noting that S S t o t ( \ displaystyle SS_ ( tot ) ) depends only on y , the non-decreasing property of R follows directly from the definition above .
