Keratinocytes lose their nuclei and their cytoplasm appears granular . Lipids , contained into those keratinocytes within lamellar bodies , are released into the extracellular space through exocytosis to form a lipid barrier . Those polar lipids are then converted into non-polar lipids and arranged parallel to the cell surface . For example glycosphingolipids become ceramides and phospholipids become free fatty acids .
