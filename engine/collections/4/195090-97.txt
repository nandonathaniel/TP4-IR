Each screw is wrought from a cube steel alloy mass into bold cross shape and punched through the center . Hammering punches of 1 tons and 3 tons shape 4 blades . Propel section is compactly designed so that the front screw and the rear screw are put in 5 mm close to each other . A trouble happened in 1943 , when a P1Y tested the torpedo released at altitude 100 m in high - speed power gliding . That torpedo veered the running direction . The hard impact on water entry made a front blade get cracked by the hit of a rear blade . The project members shared the recognition on the importance of annealing , quench hardening , and normalizing process of the screw blades , and so was done .
