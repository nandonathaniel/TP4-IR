Under N.C.G.S. 14 - 402 , a county sheriff is only authorized to issue a permit to receive or purchase a handgun when an application is submitted by a person who is a resident of his or her particular county . The sole exception is that the sheriff may issue a permit to a non-resident when the purpose of the permit is collecting . Before issuing a permit , the sheriff must fully satisfy himself / herself by affidavits , oral evidence , or otherwise , that the applicant is of good moral character and that the person , firm , or corporation wants to possess the weapon for one of the following purposes : The protection of the applicant 's home , business , person , family , or property ; target shooting ; collection ; or hunting . The sheriff must also verify by a criminal history background investigation that it is not a violation of the state or federal law for the applicant to purchase , transfer , receive , or possess a handgun . In order to determine criminal history of the applicant , the sheriff must access the computerized criminal history records maintained by the State and Federal Bureaus of Investigation , by conducting a national criminal history records check , and by conducting a criminal history check through the Administrative Office of the Courts .
