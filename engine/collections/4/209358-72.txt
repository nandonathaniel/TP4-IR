Protanomaly ( 1 % of males , 0.01 % of females ) : Having a mutated form of the long - wavelength ( red ) pigment , whose peak sensitivity is at a shorter wavelength than in the normal retina , protanomalous individuals are less sensitive to red light than normal . This means that they are less able to discriminate colors , and they do not see mixed lights as having the same colors as normal observers . They also suffer from a darkening of the red end of the spectrum . This causes reds to reduce in intensity to the point where they can be mistaken for black . Protanomaly is a fairly rare form of color blindness , making up about 1 % of the male population . Both protanomaly and deuteranomaly are carried on the X chromosome .
