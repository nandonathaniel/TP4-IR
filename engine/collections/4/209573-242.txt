The United States was not prepared to prosecute a war , for Madison had assumed that the state militias would easily seize Canada and that negotiations would follow . In 1812 , the regular army consisted of fewer than 12,000 men . Congress authorized the expansion of the army to 35,000 men , but the service was voluntary and unpopular ; it offered poor pay , and there were few trained and experienced officers , at least initially . The militia objected to serving outside their home states , were not open to discipline , and performed poorly against British forces when outside their home states . American prosecution of the war suffered from its unpopularity , especially in New England , where anti-war speakers were vocal . `` Two of the Massachusetts members ( of Congress ) , Seaver and Widgery , were publicly insulted and hissed on Change in Boston ; while another , Charles Turner , member for the Plymouth district , and Chief - Justice of the Court of Sessions for that county , was seized by a crowd on the evening of August 3 , ( 1812 ) and kicked through the town '' . The United States had great difficulty financing its war . It had disbanded its national bank , and private bankers in the Northeast were opposed to the war . The United States was able to obtain financing from London - based Barings Bank to cover overseas bond obligations . The failure of New England to provide militia units or financial support was a serious blow . Threats of secession by New England states were loud , as evidenced by the Hartford Convention . Britain exploited these divisions , blockading only southern ports for much of the war and encouraging smuggling .
