Shewhart read the new statistical theories coming out of Britain , especially the work of William Sealy Gosset , Karl Pearson , and Ronald Fisher . However , he understood that data from physical processes seldom produced a `` normal distribution curve '' ; that is , a Gaussian distribution or `` bell curve '' . He discovered that data from measurements of variation in manufacturing did not always behave the way as data from measurements of natural phenomena ( for example , Brownian motion of particles ) . Shewhart concluded that while every process displays variation , some processes display variation that is natural to the process ( `` common '' sources of variation ) - these processes were described as ' in ( statistical ) control ' . Other processes additionally display variation that is not present in the causal system of the process at all times ( `` special '' sources of variation ) , and these were described as ' not in control ' .
