Bimetallism became a center of political conflict toward the end of the nineteenth century . To finance the Civil War , the U.S. switched from bimetallism to a flat greenback currency . In 1873 , the government passed the Fourth Coinage Act and soon resumption to specie payments began without the free and unlimited coinage of silver . This put the U.S. on a mono - metallic gold standard . This angered the proponents of monetary silver , known as the silverites . They referred to this act as `` The Crime of ' 73 , '' as it was judged to have inhibited inflation .
