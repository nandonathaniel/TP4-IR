The tournament , inaugurated in 1980 , was originally held on campus sites ; the first tournament to take place at a neutral site was in 1987 . The two most frequent sites for the tournament have been McKenzie Arena in Chattanooga , Tennessee ( seven times ) and the Albany Civic Center in Albany , Georgia ( six times ) ; however , the tournament was last played in Albany in 1992 and Chattanooga in 2000 . Because demand for women 's tournament tickets is generally lower than for the men 's tournament , it is typically played in a smaller venue than the men 's tournament in the same season . The most frequent venues since 2000 have been Bridgestone Arena in Nashville ( five times ) , Infinite Energy Arena in Duluth , Georgia ( four ) , and Verizon Arena in North Little Rock , Arkansas ( four ) .
