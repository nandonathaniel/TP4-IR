Katherine Briggs and her daughter Isabel Myers developed a psychological test that reproducibly identifies sixteen distinct human temperaments , building on work by Jung . A wide class of temperaments ( `` Sensors '' , half by category , 60 % of the general population ) ( citation needed ) prefer to use concrete information such as facts and procedures . They prefer not to use abstract theories or logic . In terms of education , some authorities ( citation needed ) interpret this to mean that 60 % of the general population only use , and therefore would prefer to learn answers to concrete `` Who , what , when , where '' , and `` how '' questions , rather than answers to the theoretical `` which '' and `` why '' questions advocated by progressives . This information was confirmed ( on another research track ( citation needed ) ) by Jean Piaget , who discovered that nearly 60 % of adults never habitually use what he called `` formal operational reasoning '' , a term for the development and use of theories and explicit logic . If this criticism is true , then schools that teach only principles would fail to educate 60 % of the general population . ( citation needed )
