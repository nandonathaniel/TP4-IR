According to Chandan Gowda , a professor at the Azim Premji University , `` the social order ( in the film ) appears to be a varna order : Brahmins , Kshatriyas and Vaishyas are named with the Shudras staying an unnamed presence , '' also noting that `` Muslims are also part of the Mahishmati kingdom . '' Mahesh Kathi felt that the modules and imagery were borrowed from Indian epics like Mahabharata and called Prabhas ' character `` a mix of the Pandavas put together , '' while Gowda writes that the influence is `` at best rough , '' stating that the film can not match the `` moral depth or complexity '' of Mahabharata . He further contrasts the themes of both , writing , `` the heroes have failings and the villains redeeming virtues , making us morally ambivalent towards them both , Baahubali goes for black and white : its heroes are wholly good and the villains pure evil . '' According to Gowda , the palace scenes resemble those in Ben Hur ( 1959 ) and Troy ( 2004 ) while the fight sequences are similar to the Chinese films Crouching Tiger , Hidden Dragon ( 2000 ) .
