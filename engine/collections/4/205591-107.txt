When , in the Western Church , the sacrament was conferred only on those in immediate danger of death , it came to be known as `` Extreme Unction '' , i.e. `` Final Anointing '' , administered as one of the Last Rites . The other Last Rites are Confession ( if the dying person is physically unable to confess , at least absolution , conditional on the existence of contrition , is given ) , and the Eucharist , which when administered to the dying is known as `` Viaticum '' , a word whose original meaning in Latin was `` provision for a journey '' .
