Not long after Kuok 's purchase of the newspaper , and after running several cartoons about the culling of human body parts from Chinese prisoners , Larry Feign was abruptly dismissed and his satirical comic strip `` Lily Wong '' axed in 1995 . His firing was defended as `` cost cutting '' , but was widely viewed as political self - censorship in the face of Hong Kong 's imminent handover to the PRC . In his book North Wind , Hong Kong author Nury Vittachi documented that then editor , Jonathan Fenby , who had freshly joined from The Observer , suppressed letters querying the disappearance of the popular strip and then busied himself writing letters to international media that had covered the Feign case defending the sacking . Vittachi explained his own departure from the journal in his book , linking it to the pressures he -- and other contributors -- faced from top management and editors to abstain from writing on topics that were deemed `` sensitive '' , basically in denial of the free speech rights enshrined in the Hong Kong Basic Law and the one country , two systems policy .
