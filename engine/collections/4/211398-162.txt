The East Pakistanis observed that the West Pakistani establishment would swiftly depose any East Pakistanis elected Prime Minister of Pakistan , such as Khawaja Nazimuddin , Mohammad Ali Bogra , or Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy . Their suspicions were further aggravated by the military dictatorships of Ayub Khan ( 27 October 1958 -- 25 March 1969 ) and Yahya Khan ( 25 March 1969 -- 20 December 1971 ) , both West Pakistanis . The situation reached a climax in 1970 , when the Bangladesh Awami League , the largest East Pakistani political party , led by Sheikh Mujibur Rahman , won a landslide victory in the national elections . The party won 167 of the 169 seats allotted to East Pakistan , and thus a majority of the 313 seats in the National Assembly . This gave the Awami League the constitutional right to form a government . However , Zulfikar Ali Bhutto ( a former Foreign Minister ) , the leader of the Pakistan Peoples Party , refused to allow Rahman to become the Prime Minister of Pakistan . Instead , he proposed the idea of having two Prime Ministers , one for each wing . The proposal elicited outrage in the east wing , already chafing under the other constitutional innovation , the `` One Unit scheme '' . Bhutto also refused to accept Rahman 's Six Points . On 3 March 1971 , the two leaders of the two wings along with the President General Yahya Khan met in Dacca to decide the fate of the country . After their discussions yielded no satisfactory results , Sheikh Mujibur Rahman called for a nationwide strike . Bhutto feared a civil war , therefore , he sent his trusted companion , Mubashir Hassan . A message was conveyed , and Rahman decided to meet Bhutto . Upon his arrival , Rahman met with Bhutto and both agreed to form a coalition government with Rahman as Premier and Bhutto as President . However , the military was unaware of these developments , and Bhutto increased his pressure on Rahman to reach a decision .
