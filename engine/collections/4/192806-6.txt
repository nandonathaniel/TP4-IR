Near the surface of the Earth , the acceleration due to gravity g = 9.81 m / s ( meters per second squared ; which might be thought of as `` meters per second , per second '' , or 32.2 ft / s as `` feet per second per second '' ) approximately . For other planets , multiply g by the appropriate scaling factor . A coherent set of units for g , d , t and v is essential . Assuming SI units , g is measured in meters per second squared , so d must be measured in meters , t in seconds and v in meters per second .
