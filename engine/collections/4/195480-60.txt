From this point on , Stephens voted with the Democrats . Until after 1855 , Stephens could not be properly called a Democrat , and even then , he never officially declared it . In this move , Stephens broke irrevocably with many of his former Whig colleagues . When the Whig Party disintegrated after the election of 1852 , some Whigs flocked to the short - lived Know - Nothing Party , but Stephens fiercely opposed the Know - Nothings both for their secrecy and their anti-immigrant and anti-Catholic position .
