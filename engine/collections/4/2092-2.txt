802.11 b and 802.11 g use the 2.4 GHz ISM band , operating in the United States under Part 15 of the U.S. Federal Communications Commission Rules and Regulations . Because of this choice of frequency band , 802.11 b and g equipment may occasionally suffer interference from microwave ovens , cordless telephones , and Bluetooth devices . 802.11 b and 802.11 g control their interference and susceptibility to interference by using direct - sequence spread spectrum ( DSSS ) and orthogonal frequency - division multiplexing ( OFDM ) signaling methods , respectively . 802.11 a uses the 5 GHz U-NII band , which , for much of the world , offers at least 23 non-overlapping channels rather than the 2.4 GHz ISM frequency band offering only three non-overlapping channels , where other adjacent channels overlap -- see list of WLAN channels . Better or worse performance with higher or lower frequencies ( channels ) may be realized , depending on the environment . 802.11 n can use either the 2.4 GHz or the 5 GHz band ; 802.11 ac uses only the 5 GHz band .
