A secondary sense is that of a long fly ball , usually one that travels backward from home plate . This usage appears to be restricted to sandlot ball games in New England , where it may have evolved from a supposed `` Chaney 's home run '' , a backward foul by a player of that name that eventually won a game for the hitting team when the ball , the last one available , could not be found . The umpire then ruled that the other team had failed to provide an adequate amount of balls and thus had forfeited the game .
