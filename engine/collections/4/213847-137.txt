He was a hero of the Republic , who seemed once to hold the Roman world in his palm , only to be brought low by Caesar . Pompey was idealized as a tragic hero almost immediately after Pharsalus and his murder . Plutarch portrayed him as a Roman Alexander the Great , pure of heart and mind , destroyed by the cynical ambitions of those around him . This portrayal of him survived into the Renaissance and Baroque periods , for example in Corneille 's play The Death of Pompey ( 1642 ) . In spite of his war against Caesar , Pompey was still widely celebrated during the imperial period , as the conqueror of the orient ; e.g. , at Augustus ' funeral procession , pictures of him were carried . As a triumphator , he also had numerous statues in Rome , one of which was on the forum of Augustus . Though the imperial power did not honor him as much as his archenemy , who was considered a god , his reputation among many aristocrats and historians was equal or even superior to that of Caesar .
