Research in writing development has been limited in psychology . In the research that has been conducted , focus has generally centred on the development of written and spoken language and their connection . Spoken and written skills could be considered linked . Researchers believe that children 's spoken language influences their written language . When a child learns to write they need to master letter formation , spelling , punctuation and they also have to gain an understanding of the structure and the organisational patterns involved in written language .
