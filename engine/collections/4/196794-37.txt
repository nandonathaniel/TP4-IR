As the `` menace '' of printing spread , governments established centralized control mechanisms , and in 1557 the English Crown thought to stem the flow of seditious and heretical books by chartering the Stationers ' Company . The right to print was limited to the members of that guild , and thirty years later the Star Chamber was chartered to curtail the `` greate enormities and abuses '' of `` dyvers contentyous and disorderlye persons professinge the arte or mystere of pryntinge or selling of books . '' The right to print was restricted to two universities and to the 21 existing printers in the city of London , which had 53 printing presses . The French crown also repressed printing , and printer Etienne Dolet was burned at the stake in 1546 . As the English took control of type founding in 1637 , printers fled to the Netherlands . Confrontation with authority made printers radical and rebellious , and 800 authors , printers and book dealers were incarcerated in the Bastille before it was stormed in 1789 . The notion that the expression of dissent or subversive views should be tolerated , not censured or punished by law , developed alongside the rise of printing and the press . The Areopagitica , published in 1644 under the full title Areopagitica : A speech of Mr. John Milton for the liberty of unlicensed printing to the Parliament of England , was John Milton 's response to the English parliament re-introducing government licensing of printers , hence publishers . In doing so Milton articulated the main strands of future discussions about freedom of expression . By defining the scope of freedom of expression and of `` harmful '' speech Milton argued against the principle of pre-censorship and in favour of tolerance for a wide range of views .
