The last great ambitious ruler of the Tang dynasty was Emperor Xianzong ( r . 805 -- 820 ) , whose reign was aided by the fiscal reforms of the 780s , including a government monopoly on the salt industry . He also had an effective well trained imperial army stationed at the capital led by his court eunuchs ; this was the Army of Divine Strategy , numbering 240,000 in strength as recorded in 798 . Between the years 806 and 819 , Emperor Xianzong conducted seven major military campaigns to quell the rebellious provinces that had claimed autonomy from central authority , managing to subdue all but two of them . Under his reign there was a brief end to the hereditary jiedushi , as Xianzong appointed his own military officers and staffed the regional bureaucracies once again with civil officials . However , Xianzong 's successors proved less capable and more interested in the leisure of hunting , feasting , and playing outdoor sports , allowing eunuchs to amass more power as drafted scholar - officials caused strife in the bureaucracy with factional parties . The eunuchs ' power became unchallenged after Emperor Wenzong 's ( r . 826 -- 840 ) failed plot to have them overthrown ; instead the allies of Emperor Wenzong were publicly executed in the West Market of Chang'an , by the eunuchs ' command .
