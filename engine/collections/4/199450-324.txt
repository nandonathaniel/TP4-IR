In the 18th century Bohemia produced an architectural peculiarity -- the Baroque Gothic style , a synthesis of the Gothic and Baroque styles . This was not a simple return to Gothic details , but rather an original Baroque transformation . The main representative and originator of this style was Jan Bla≈æej Santini - Aichel , who used this style in renovating medieval monastic buildings or in Pilgrimage Church of Saint John of Nepomuk .
