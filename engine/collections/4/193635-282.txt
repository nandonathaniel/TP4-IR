Although the country has adopted the metric system as its official standard since 1968 , traditional units of measurement are still commonplace . The customary units of area employed in the Terai region -- such as katha , bigha , etc. -- sound similar to those used elsewhere in South Asia . However , they vary markedly in size , as they seem to have been standardised to different measures of area . For instance , a katha in Nepal is arbitrarily set at 338.63 m , while a katha in Bangladesh means about 67 m of land area . In addition to native ones , imperial units pertaining to length ( specifically inch and foot ) and metric units such as kilogram and litre are also fairly common in everyday trade and commerce .
