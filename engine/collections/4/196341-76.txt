During this time , Piłsudski was finishing his plans for the counter-offensive . He decided to supervise the attack , personally handing in a letter of resignation from all state functions so he could concentrate on the military situation and so that if he died , it would not paralyze the state . He succeeded in raising the morale of the troops , between August 12 and August 15 , visiting units of the 4th Army concentrating near Puławy , about 100 kilometres south of Warsaw .
