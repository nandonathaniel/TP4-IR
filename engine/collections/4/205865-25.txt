Dutch colonization in the Caribbean started in the 1634 on St. Croix and Tobago ( 1628 ) , followed in 1631 with settlements on Tortuga ( now Île Tortue ) and Sint Maarten . When the Dutch lost Sint Maarten ( and Anguilla where they had built a fort shortly after arriving in Sint Maarten ) to the Spanish , they settled Curaçao and Sint Eustatius . They regained half of Sint Maarten in 1648 , from then on sharing the island with France . The border between the two portions of the island continued to be modified periodically , before being set for good in 1816
