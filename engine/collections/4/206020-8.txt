In 1956 , Congress finally revised the law and authorized `` State defense forces '' permanently under Title 32 , Section 109 , of the United States Code . Two years later , Congress amended the law and changed the name from `` State defense forces '' to `` defense forces . '' Still , it was not until the early Ronald Reagan administration that many states developed their defense forces into elements that existed beyond paper , when the U.S. Department of Defense actively encouraged states to create and maintain SDF units .
