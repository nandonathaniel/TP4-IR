By 1837 , Marx was writing both fiction and non-fiction , having completed a short novel , Scorpion and Felix , a drama , Oulanem , as well as a number of love poems dedicated to Jenny von Westphalen , though none of this early work was published during his lifetime . Marx soon abandoned fiction for other pursuits , including the study of both English and Italian , art history and the translation of Latin classics . He began co-operating with Bruno Bauer on editing Hegel 's Philosophy of Religion in 1840 . Marx was also engaged in writing his doctoral thesis , The Difference Between the Democritean and Epicurean Philosophy of Nature , which he completed in 1841 . It was described as `` a daring and original piece of work in which Marx set out to show that theology must yield to the superior wisdom of philosophy '' . The essay was controversial , particularly among the conservative professors at the University of Berlin . Marx decided instead to submit his thesis to the more liberal University of Jena , whose faculty awarded him his PhD in April 1841 . As Marx and Bauer were both atheists , in March 1841 they began plans for a journal entitled Archiv des Atheismus ( Atheistic Archives ) , but it never came to fruition . In July , Marx and Bauer took a trip to Bonn from Berlin . There they scandalised their class by getting drunk , laughing in church and galloping through the streets on donkeys .
