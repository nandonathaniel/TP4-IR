Some species explicitly adapt to tidal flux . In Roscoe Bay , jellyfish ride the current at ebb tide until they hit a gravel bar , and then descend below the current . They remain in still waters until the tide rises , ascending and allowing it to sweep them back into the bay . They also actively avoid fresh water from mountain snowmelt , diving until they find enough salt .
