The pars distalis , ( distal part ) , comprises the majority of the anterior pituitary and is where the bulk of pituitary hormone production occurs . The pars distalis contains two types of cells including chromophobe cells and chromophil cells . The chromophils can be further divided into acidophils ( alpha cells ) and basophils ( beta cells ) . These cells all together produce hormones of the anterior pituitary , and release them into the blood stream .
