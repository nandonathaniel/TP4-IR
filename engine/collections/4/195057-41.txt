Upon arriving in Konoha , preparations are made to formally put Tsunade into office , though she is largely uninterested in formalities and leaves the task to her new assistants . She makes her rounds in the Konoha hospital , healing Kakashi Hatake and Sasuke of the damage done to their minds by Itachi 's Tsukuyomi . When examining the wounds to Rock Lee 's body , Tsunade discovers that the damage to his spine is too extensive , even for her , to heal with certainty . She advises Lee to give up on his dreams of being a ninja , citing that there is only a 50 % chance that he will survive the operation .
