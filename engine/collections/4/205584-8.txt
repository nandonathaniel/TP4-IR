Ironically , telling people to `` think outside the box '' does not help them think outside the box , at least not with the 9 - dot problem . This is due to the distinction between procedural knowledge ( implicit or tacit knowledge ) and declarative knowledge ( book knowledge ) . For example , a non-verbal cue such as drawing a square outside the 9 dots does allow people to solve the 9 - dot problem better than average .
