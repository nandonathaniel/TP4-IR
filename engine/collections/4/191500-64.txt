An early and very influential modern historian , George Grote , set the tone by expressing incredulity at the numbers given by Herodotus : `` To admit this overwhelming total , or anything near to it , is obviously impossible . '' Grote 's main objection is the supply problem , though he does not analyse the problem in detail . He did not reject Herodotus 's account altogether , citing the latter 's reporting of the Persians ' careful methods of accounting and their stockpiling of supply caches for three years , but drew attention to the contradictions in the ancient sources . A later influential historian , J.B. Bury , calls Herodotus 's numbers `` wholly fabulous '' and judges that the Persian land forces may have been 180,000 . A major limiting factor for the size of the Persian army , first suggested by Sir Frederick Maurice ( a British transport officer ) is the supply of water . Maurice suggested in the region of 200,000 men and 70,000 animals could have been supported by the rivers in that region of Greece . He further suggested that Herodotus may have confused the Persian terms for chiliarchy ( 1,000 ) and myriarchy ( 10,000 ) , leading to an exaggeration by a factor of ten . Other early modern scholars estimated that the land forces participating in the invasion at 100,000 soldiers or less , based on the logistical systems available to the Ancients .
