In the 1920s microfilm began to be used in a commercial setting . New York City banker George McCarthy was issued a patent in 1925 for his `` Checkograph '' machine , designed to make micrographic copies of cancelled checks for permanent storage by financial institutions . In 1928 , the Eastman Kodak Company bought McCarthy 's invention and began marketing check microfilming devices under its `` Recordak '' division .
