The deep nuclei of the cerebellum are clusters of gray matter lying within the white matter at the core of the cerebellum . They are , with the minor exception of the nearby vestibular nuclei , the sole sources of output from the cerebellum . These nuclei receive collateral projections from mossy fibers and climbing fibers as well as inhibitory input from the Purkinje cells of the cerebellar cortex . The four nuclei ( dentate , globose , emboliform , and fastigial ) each communicate with different parts of the brain and cerebellar cortex . ( The globose and the emboliform nuclei are also referred to as combined in the interposed nucleus ) . The fastigial and interposed nuclei belong to the spinocerebellum . The dentate nucleus , which in mammals is much larger than the others , is formed as a thin , convoluted layer of gray matter , and communicates exclusively with the lateral parts of the cerebellar cortex . The flocculonodular lobe is the only part of the cerebellar cortex that does not project to the deep nuclei -- its output goes to the vestibular nuclei instead .
