Forced or unfair labor in textile production is not limited to developing countries . Charges of use of sweatshop labor are endemic in the United States . Immigrant women work long hours and receive less than minimum wage . In the United States , there is more of a stigma against child labor than forced labor in general . Consumers in the United States are willing to suspend the importation of textiles made with child labor in other countries but do not expect their exports to be suspended by other countries , even when produced using forced labor .
