Bloom made his Broadway stage debut as Romeo in Romeo and Juliet in August 2013 at the Richard Rodgers Theatre . The New York Times theatre critic Ben Brantley described Bloom 's performance as `` a first - rate Broadway debut '' in the title role : `` For once , we have a Romeo who evolves substantively , from a posturing youth in love with love , to a man who discovers the startling revelation of real love , with a last - act descent into bilious , bitter anger that verges on madness .
