Carthage never managed to recover after the Second Punic War and the Third Punic War that followed was in reality a simple punitive mission to raze the city of Carthage to the ground . Carthage was almost defenceless and when besieged offered immediate surrender , conceding to a string of outrageous Roman demands . The Romans refused the surrender , demanding as their further terms of surrender the complete destruction of the city and , seeing little to lose , the Carthaginians prepared to fight . In the Battle of Carthage the city was stormed after a short siege and completely destroyed , its culture `` almost totally extinguished '' .
