The field developed during the 18th century , especially in Prussia and France where scientific forestry methods were developed . These methods were first applied rigorously in British India from the early - 19th century . The government was interested in the use of forest produce and began managing the forests with measures to reduce the risk of wildfire in order to protect the `` household '' of nature , as it was then termed . This early ecological idea was in order to preserve the growth of delicate teak trees , which was an important resource for the Royal Navy . Concerns over teak depletion were raised as early as 1799 and 1805 when the Navy was undergoing a massive expansion during the Napoleonic Wars ; this pressure led to the first formal conservation Act , which prohibited the felling of small teak trees . The first forestry officer was appointed in 1806 to regulate and preserve the trees necessary for shipbuilding . This promising start received a setback in the 1820s and 30s , when laissez - faire economics and complaints from private landowners brought these early conservation attempts to an end .
