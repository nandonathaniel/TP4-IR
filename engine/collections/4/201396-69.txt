Office 2010 introduces improvements to the image crop process in Excel , Outook , PowerPoint , Word . The crop selection rectangle now grays out the portions of an image to be removed during a crop process and displays the result area in color , instead of completely removing all portions of an image outside of the selection rectangle from view as in previous versions of Office ; images can now be repositioned underneath the selection rectangle while it is active . A new Aspect Ratio option under the Crop command on the ribbon presents a drop - drop down menu with options for both landscape and portrait page orientations to customize the aspect ratio of the selection rectangle before users crop an image , which automatically resizes the selection rectangle when users start the crop process ; users can manually resize the selection rectangle and simultaneously preserve its aspect ratio by resizing it from its corners while pressing the â‡§ Shift key . The aforementioned cropping improvements are also available in Publisher .
