The Congress governments under Reddy placed emphasis on rural development , agriculture and allied sectors . The shift towards industrialisation remained limited and was largely driven by the central government 's investments in large public sector enterprises in the state . Reddy 's first term as Chief Minister ended in 1960 after he resigned on being elected President of the Indian National Congress . In 1964 , he resigned voluntarily following unfavourable observations made against the Government of Andhra Pradesh by the Supreme Court in the Bus Routes Nationalisation case .
