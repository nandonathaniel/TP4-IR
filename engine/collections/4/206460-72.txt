Boss Jefferson Davis `` J.D. '' Hogg ( Sorrell Booke ) is the wealthiest man in Hazzard County and owns most of its property and businesses -- whether directly or by holding the mortgages over the land . Usually dressed in an all - white suit , he is the fat , greedy , corrupt County Commissioner with visions of grandeur , a voracious appetite for food , who constantly orders Rosco to `` Get them Duke Boys ! '' He is also Bo and Luke 's Probation officer , when Bo and Luke need to leave Hazzard they always get permission from him . Boss Hogg is also married to ( and dominated by ) Rosco 's `` fat sister '' ( Lulu Hogg ) , a point that does not always sit well with either Boss Hogg or Rosco ; Hogg sometimes claims that Rosco is indebted to him because of it , though his on - screen interactions with Lulu typically show him loving her deeply ( and giving in to her stronger personality ) . In addition to his role as county commissioner he is also the police commissioner , land commissioner , and bank president . Boss is also the chief of the Hazzard Fire Department and the owner of or primary mortgage holder on most of the places in the county , including the Boar 's Nest , Rhubottem 's Store , Cooter 's garage and the Duke Farm . It is implied in some episodes that he is the Justice of the Peace but in others Hazzard relies on a circuit judge . In the episode `` Coltrane vs. Duke '' , Hogg represents Rosco when he sues the Dukes , implying that he is a licensed attorney . His vehicle is a white 1970 Cadillac Coupe de Ville convertible , with bull horns mounted on the hood . In the first few seasons , he is almost always driven around by a chauffeur . His old moonshine - running car was called the `` Grey Ghost '' . Every morning , Boss Hogg would drink coffee and eat raw liver ( Sorrell Booke , a method actor , actually ate the raw liver ) . Boss Hogg is described in one analysis as `` an ineffectual bad guy -- hence amusing '' .
