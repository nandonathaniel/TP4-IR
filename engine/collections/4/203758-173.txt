Each chamber determines its own internal rules of operation unless specified in the Constitution or prescribed by law . In the House , a Rules Committee guides legislation ; in the Senate , a Standing Rules committee is in charge . Each branch has its own traditions ; for example , the Senate relies heavily on the practice of getting `` unanimous consent '' for noncontroversial matters . House and Senate rules can be complex , sometimes requiring a hundred specific steps before becoming a law . Members sometimes use experts such as Walter Oleszek , a senior specialist in American national government at the Congressional Research Service , to learn about proper procedures .
