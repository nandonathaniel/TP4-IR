Oil - eating bacteria biodegrade oil that has escaped to the surface . Oil sands are reservoirs of partially biodegraded oil still in the process of escaping and being biodegraded , but they contain so much migrating oil that , although most of it has escaped , vast amounts are still present -- more than can be found in conventional oil reservoirs . The lighter fractions of the crude oil are destroyed first , resulting in reservoirs containing an extremely heavy form of crude oil , called crude bitumen in Canada , or extra-heavy crude oil in Venezuela . These two countries have the world 's largest deposits of oil sands .
