More than 300 small volcanic islands make up this chain , which stretches over 1,200 miles ( 1,900 km ) into the Pacific Ocean . Some of these islands fall in the Eastern Hemisphere , but the International Date Line was drawn west of 180 Â° to keep the whole state , and thus the entire North American continent , within the same legal day . Two of the islands , Attu and Kiska , were occupied by Japanese forces during World War II .
