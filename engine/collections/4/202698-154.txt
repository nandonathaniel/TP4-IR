Thiers and Guizot , who dominated the triumvirate , decided to get rid of Marshal Soult , who was appreciated by the king for his compliant attitude . Seizing the opportunity of an incident concerning the French possessions in Algeria , they pushed Soult to resign on 18 July 1834 . He was replaced by Marshal Gérard , with the other ministers remaining in place . Gérard , however , was forced to resign in turn , on 29 October 1834 , over the question of an amnesty for the 2,000 prisoners detained in April . Louis - Philippe , the Doctrinaires ( including Guizot and Thiers ) and the core of the government opposed the amnesty , but the Tiers Parti managed to convince Gérard to announce it , underscoring the logistical difficulties in organizing such a large trial before the Chamber of Peers .
