There is some suggestion that Welsh Rabbit derives from a South Wales Valleys staple , in which a generous lump of cheese is placed into a mixture of beaten eggs and milk , seasoned with salt and pepper , and baked in the oven until the egg mixture has firmed and the cheese has melted . Onion may be added and the mixture would be eaten with bread and butter and occasionally with the vinegar from pickled beetroot .
