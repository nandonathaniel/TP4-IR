There was some confusion about the republican ideal during the war years . The Herenigde Nasionale Party , with Hertzog its leader , pushed the issue into the background . After Hertzog left the party , however , it became republican . In 1942 and 1944 Daniel Fran√ßois Malan introduced a motion in the House of Assembly in favour of the establishment of a republic , but this was defeated .
