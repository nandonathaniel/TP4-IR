The night after the race , the prizes are distributed at the annual 500 Victory Banquet . The traditional awards banquet dates back many decades . In 1972 , the black - tie gala was moved to the Indiana Convention Center , and was held there until the mid-2000s . In more recent years , it has been held at a pavilion on the grounds of the Speedway . The 1973 banquet was cancelled due to the rain delay and tragic circumstances surrounding the event . For a brief time ( 2000 - 2001 ) , the banquet was held on Sunday night , a few hours after the conclusion of the race . The 2000 race did not end until nearly 6 p.m. due to a rain delay , and participants had to rush downtown to make the banquet on time . In 2002 , the banquet was moved back to Monday night . In 1986 , the race was delayed until the following Saturday due to rain , and the banquet was cancelled due to scheduling concerns . A private victory luncheon for the top three finishers was held the day after the race at the Speedway Motel .
