In 2003 , the Celtics were sold by owner Paul Gaston to Boston Basketball Partners L.L.C. , led by H. Irving Grousbeck , Wycliffe Grousbeck and Steve Pagliuca . The team made it back to the playoffs but were swept by the Nets in the second round , despite bringing Game 4 to double overtime . Before their elimination , the team hired former Celtics ' guard Danny Ainge as general manager , moving Chris Wallace to another position in the organization . Ainge believed the team had reached its peak and promptly sent Antoine Walker to the Dallas Mavericks ( along with Tony Delk ) . In return , the Celtics received the often - injured Raef LaFrentz , Chris Mills , Jiří Welsch , and a first - round pick in 2004 . The Celtics made the playoffs , only to be swept in the first round by the Indiana Pacers , losing all 4 games by blowout margins .
