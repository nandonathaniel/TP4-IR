The 1871 English language edition published by Griffith and Farran ( named Journey to the Centre of the Earth at Project Gutenberg ) is an abridged and altered translation . It changes the Professor 's name to Hardwigg , Axel 's name to Harry ( or Henry ) Lawson , and Gr√§uben 's name to Gretchen . It omits some chapters , while rewriting or adding portions to others . The redactor 's note by Norm Wolcott , at Project Gutenberg , claims that this translation is the most popularly reprinted one , despite the flaws . The 1877 translation by Ward , Lock , & Co. , Ltd. , translated by Frederick Amadeus Malleson , is more faithful , though it too has some slight rewrites ( according to the redactor at its Project Gutenberg page , where its title is translated as Journey to the Interior of the Earth ) .
