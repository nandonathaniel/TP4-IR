Ilya Salkind had first conceived the idea for a Superman film in late 1973 . In November 1974 , after a long , difficult process with DC Comics , the Superman film rights were purchased by Ilya , his father Alexander Salkind , and their partner Pierre Spengler . DC wanted a list of actors that were to be considered for Superman , and approved the producer 's choices of Muhammad Ali , Al Pacino , James Caan , Steve McQueen , Clint Eastwood and Dustin Hoffman . The filmmakers felt it was best to film Superman and Superman II back - to - back , simultaneously , and to make a negative pickup deal with Warner Bros. William Goldman was approached to write the screenplay , while Leigh Brackett was considered . Ilya hired Alfred Bester , who began writing a film treatment . Alexander felt , however , that Bester was not famous enough , so he hired Mario Puzo ( The Godfather ) to write the screenplay at a $600,000 salary . Francis Ford Coppola , William Friedkin , Richard Lester , Peter Yates , John Guillermin , Ronald Neame and Sam Peckinpah were in negotiations to direct . Peckinpah dropped out when he produced a gun during a meeting with Ilya . George Lucas turned down the offer because of his commitment to Star Wars .
