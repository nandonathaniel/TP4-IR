On the August 19 episode of Raw , as a result of speaking out against COO Triple H , Show was placed into a three - on - one handicap tornado tag team match against The Shield , which Show lost . Additional punishment followed with Show being forced to sit ringside and watch his friends being attacked by the Shield and Randy Orton at the risk of being fired . Following this , The Authority ( Triple H and Stephanie McMahon ) claimed Show was broke , and in order to save his job , forced him to knock out his friends including Daniel Bryan , Dusty Rhodes , and The Miz . When Show attempted to revolt on the September 30 episode of Raw , he was almost arrested for threatening to knock out Triple H but Stephanie McMahon came to his aid and insulted him afterwards . At Battleground , Big Show interfered in the WWE title match between Bryan and Orton and knocked out both of them , ending the match in a no - contest . During November 2013 , Show started a feud with WWE Champion Orton , who was part of the Authority , but failed to win the title at Survivor Series .
