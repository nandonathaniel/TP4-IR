Natural resource economics is a transdisciplinary field of academic research within economics that aims to address the connections and interdependence between human economies and natural ecosystems . Its focus is how to operate an economy within the ecological constraints of earth 's natural resources . Resource economics brings together and connects different disciplines within the natural and social sciences connected to broad areas of earth science , human economics , and natural ecosystems . Economic models must be adapted to accommodate the special features of natural resource inputs . The traditional curriculum of natural resource economics emphasized fisheries models , forestry models , and minerals extraction models ( i.e. fish , trees , and ore ) . In recent years , however , other resources , notably air , water , the global climate , and `` environmental resources '' in general have become increasingly important to policy - making .
