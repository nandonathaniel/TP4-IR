Villefort had once conducted an affair with Madame Danglars . She became pregnant and delivered the child in the house that the Count has now purchased . To cover up the affair , Villefort told Madame Danglars that the infant was stillborn , smothered the child , and thinking him to be dead , buried him in the garden . While Villefort was burying the child , he was stabbed by the smuggler Bertuccio , who unearthed the child and resuscitated him . Bertuccio 's sister - in - law brought the child up , giving him the name `` Benedetto '' . Benedetto takes up a life of crime as he grows into adolescence . He robs his adoptive mother ( Bertuccio 's sister - in - law ) and ends up killing her , then runs away . Bertuccio later becomes the Count 's servant and informs him of this history .
