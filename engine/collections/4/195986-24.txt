Originally , the trophy presented to the event 's winner was the Challenge Belt , a red leather belt with a silver buckle . The Challenge Belt was retired in 1870 , when Young Tom Morris was allowed to keep it for winning the tournament three consecutive times . Because no trophy was available , the tournament was cancelled in 1871 . In 1872 , after Young Tom Morris won again for a fourth time in a row , he was awarded a medal . The present trophy , The Golf Champion Trophy , better known by its popular name of the Claret Jug , was then created .
