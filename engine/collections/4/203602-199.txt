In a declassified document it was revealed that 17,835 phone lines were on an improperly permitted `` alert list '' from 2006 to 2009 in breach of compliance , which tagged these phone lines for daily monitoring . Eleven percent of these monitored phone lines met the agency 's legal standard for `` reasonably articulable suspicion '' ( RAS ) . The NSA tracks the locations of hundreds of millions of cellphones per day , allowing it to map people 's movements and relationships in detail . The NSA has been reported to have access to all communications made via Google , Microsoft , Facebook , Yahoo , YouTube , AOL , Skype , Apple and Paltalk , and collects hundreds of millions of contact lists from personal email and instant messaging accounts each year . It has also managed to weaken much of the encryption used on the Internet ( by collaborating with , coercing or otherwise infiltrating numerous technology companies to leave `` backdoors '' into their systems ) , so that the majority of encryption is inadvertently vulnerable to different forms of attack .
