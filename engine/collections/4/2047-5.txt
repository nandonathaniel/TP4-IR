In modern times , the Ides of March is best known as the date on which Julius Caesar was assassinated in 44 BC . Caesar was stabbed to death at a meeting of the Senate . As many as 60 conspirators , led by Brutus and Cassius , were involved . According to Plutarch , a seer had warned that harm would come to Caesar no later than the Ides of March . On his way to the Theatre of Pompey , where he would be assassinated , Caesar passed the seer and joked , `` The Ides of March are come '' , implying that the prophecy had not been fulfilled , to which the seer replied `` Aye , Caesar ; but not gone . '' This meeting is famously dramatised in William Shakespeare 's play Julius Caesar , when Caesar is warned by the soothsayer to `` beware the Ides of March . '' The Roman biographer Suetonius identifies the `` seer '' as a haruspex named Spurinna .
