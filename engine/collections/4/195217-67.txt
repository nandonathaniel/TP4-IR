The distinction between excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters is not absolute , however . Rather , it depends on the class of chemical receptors present on the postsynaptic neuron . In principle , a single neuron , releasing a single neurotransmitter , can have excitatory effects on some targets , inhibitory effects on others , and modulatory effects on others still . For example , photoreceptor cells in the retina constantly release the neurotransmitter glutamate in the absence of light . So - called OFF bipolar cells are , like most neurons , excited by the released glutamate . However , neighboring target neurons called ON bipolar cells are instead inhibited by glutamate , because they lack the typical ionotropic glutamate receptors and instead express a class of inhibitory metabotropic glutamate receptors . When light is present , the photoreceptors cease releasing glutamate , which relieves the ON bipolar cells from inhibition , activating them ; this simultaneously removes the excitation from the OFF bipolar cells , silencing them .
