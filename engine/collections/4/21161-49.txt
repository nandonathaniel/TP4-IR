1845 : Salomon Munk , Palestine , Description Géographique , Historique et Archéologique , '' in `` L'Univers Pittoresque ; Under the name Palestine , we comprehend the small country formerly inhabited by the Israelites , and which is today part of Acre and Damascus pachalics . It stretched between 31 and 33 ° N. latitude and between 32 and 35 ° degrees E. longitude , an area of about 1300 French : lieues carrées .

He paid homage to the truth despite his fears , as he said himself , of availing the Promised Land to pagan mockery , `` Pudet dicere latitudinem terrae repromissionis , ne ethnicis occasionem blasphemandi dedisse uideamur '' .
