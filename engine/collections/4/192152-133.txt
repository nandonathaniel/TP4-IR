In the Egyptian , Greek and Roman empires , women usually fed only their own children . However , breastfeeding began to be seen as something too common to be done by royalty , and wet nurses were employed to breastfeed the children of the royal families . This extended over time , particularly in western Europe , where noble women often made use of wet nurses . Lower - class women breastfed their infants and used a wet nurse only if they were unable to feed their own infant . Attempts were made in 15th - century Europe to use cow or goat milk , but these attempts were not successful . In the 18th century , flour or cereal mixed with broth were introduced as substitutes for breastfeeding , but this was also unsuccessful .
