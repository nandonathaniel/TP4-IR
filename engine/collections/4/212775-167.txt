Gao , Luo , and Zhang ( 2012 ) reviewed literature about Twitter published between 2008 and 2011 . They concluded that Twitter allowed students to participate with each other in class ( by creating an informal `` back channel '' ) , and extend discussion outside of class time . They also reported that students used Twitter to get up - to - date news and connect with professionals in their field . Students reported that microblogging encouraged students to `` participate at a higher level '' . Because the posts can not exceed 140 characters , students were required to express ideas , reflect , and focus on important concepts in a concise manner . Some students found this very beneficial . Other students did not like the character limit . Also , some students found microblogging to be overwhelming ( information overload ) . The research indicated that many students did not actually participate in the discussions , `` they just lurked '' online and watched the other participants .
