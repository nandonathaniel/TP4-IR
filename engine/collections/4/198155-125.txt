AIDS stigma exists around the world in a variety of ways , including ostracism , rejection , discrimination and avoidance of HIV infected people ; compulsory HIV testing without prior consent or protection of confidentiality ; violence against HIV infected individuals or people who are perceived to be infected with HIV ; and the quarantine of HIV infected individuals . Stigma - related violence or the fear of violence prevents many people from seeking HIV testing , returning for their results , or securing treatment , possibly turning what could be a manageable chronic illness into a death sentence and perpetuating the spread of HIV .
