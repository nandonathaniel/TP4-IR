The Africanized bee , also known as the Africanised honey bee , and known colloquially as `` killer bee '' , is a hybrid of the Western honey bee species ( Apis mellifera ) , produced originally by cross-breeding of the African honey bee ( A. m. scutellata ) with various European honey bees such as the Italian bee A. m. ligustica and the Iberian bee A. m. iberiensis .
