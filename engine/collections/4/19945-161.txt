The term college , which refers to post-secondary education in general in the U.S. , refers in Canada to either a post-secondary technical or vocational institution , or to one of the colleges that exist as federated schools within some Canadian universities . Most often , a college is a community college , not a university . It may also refer to a CEGEP in Quebec . In Canada , college student might denote someone obtaining a diploma in business management while university student is the term for someone earning a bachelor 's degree . For that reason , going to college does not have the same meaning as going to university , unless the speaker or context clarifies the specific level of post-secondary education that is meant .
