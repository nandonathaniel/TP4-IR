Radon is responsible for the worldwide majority of the mean public exposure to ionizing radiation . It is often the single largest contributor to an individual 's background radiation dose , and is the most variable from location to location . Radon gas from natural sources can accumulate in buildings , especially in confined areas such as attics , and basements . It can also be found in some spring waters and hot springs .
