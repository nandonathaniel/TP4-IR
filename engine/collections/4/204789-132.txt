In the jazz scene , since the bass guitar takes on much of the same role as the double bass -- laying down the rhythm , and outlining the harmonic foundation -- electric bass players have long used both bass guitar methods and jazz double bass method books . The use of jazz double bass method books by electric bass players in jazz is facilitated in that jazz methods tend to emphasize improvisation techniques ( e.g. , how to improvise walking basslines ) and rhythmic exercises rather than specific ways of holding or plucking the instrument .
