The main sources for the history of the common law in the Middle Ages are the plea rolls and the Year Books . The plea rolls , which were the official court records for the Courts of Common Pleas and King 's Bench , were written in Latin . The rolls were made up in bundles by law term : Hilary , Easter , Trinity , and Michaelmas , or winter , spring , summer , and autumn . They are currently deposited in the UK National Archives , by whose permission images of the rolls for the Courts of Common Pleas , King 's Bench , and Exchequer of Pleas , from the 13th century to the 17th , can be viewed online at the Anglo - American Legal Tradition site ( The O'Quinn Law Library of the University of Houston Law Center ) .
