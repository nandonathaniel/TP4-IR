Fluoride toothpaste is the most widely used and rigorously evaluated fluoride treatment . Its introduction in the early 1970s is considered the main reason for the decline in tooth decay in industrialized countries , and toothpaste appears to be the single common factor in countries where tooth decay has declined . Toothpaste is the only realistic fluoride strategy in many low - income countries , where lack of infrastructure renders water or salt fluoridation infeasible . It relies on individual and family behavior , and its use is less likely among lower economic classes ; in low - income countries it is unaffordable for the poor . Fluoride toothpaste prevents about 25 % of cavities in young permanent teeth , and its effectiveness is improved if higher concentrations of fluoride are used , or if the toothbrushing is supervised . Fluoride mouthwash and gel are about as effective as fluoride toothpaste ; fluoride varnish prevents about 45 % of cavities . By comparison , brushing with a nonfluoride toothpaste has little effect on cavities .
