In early April 1945 , the 118th Base Unit transferred in from Godman Field ; its African - American personnel held orders that specified they were base cadre , not trainees . On 5 April , officers of the 477th peaceably tried to enter the whites - only Officer 's Club . Selway had been tipped off by a phone call , and had the assistant provost marshal and base billeting manager stationed at the door to refuse the 477th officers entry . The latter , a major , ordered them to leave , and took their names as a means of arresting them when they refused . It was the beginning of the Freeman Field Mutiny .
