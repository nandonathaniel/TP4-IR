Most maps and signage mark the bridge as part of the concurrency between U.S. Route 101 and California State Route 1 . Although part of the National Highway System , the bridge is not officially part of California 's Highway System . For example , under the California Streets and Highways Code ยง 401 , Route 101 ends at `` the approach to the Golden Gate Bridge '' and then resumes at `` a point in Marin County opposite San Francisco '' . The Golden Gate Bridge , Highway and Transportation District has jurisdiction over the segment of highway that crosses the bridge instead of the California Department of Transportation ( Caltrans ) .
