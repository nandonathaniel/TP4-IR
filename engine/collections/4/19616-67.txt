The film 's script went through a few drafts before a shooting script was finalized . The first version was much darker than the final film . Various scenes were cut , including one which portrayed Billy 's mother dying in her struggle with the gremlins , with her head thrown down the stairs when Billy arrives . Dante later explained the scene made the film darker than the filmmakers wanted . There was also a scene where the gremlins ate Billy 's dog and a scene where the gremlins attacked a McDonald 's , eating customers instead of burgers . Also , instead of Stripe being a mogwai who becomes a gremlin , there was originally no mogwai named Stripe ; rather , Gizmo was supposed to transform into Stripe the gremlin . Spielberg overruled this plot element as he felt Gizmo was cute and that audiences would want him to be present throughout the film .
