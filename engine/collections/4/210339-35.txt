The major neurotoxin component of the blue - ringed octopus is a compound that was originally known as maculotoxin but was later found to be identical to tetrodotoxin , a neurotoxin also found in pufferfish , and in some poison dart frogs . Tetrodotoxin is 1,200 times more toxic than cyanide . Tetrodotoxin blocks sodium channels , causing motor paralysis , and respiratory arrest within minutes of exposure . The tetrodotoxin is produced by bacteria in the salivary glands of the octopus .
