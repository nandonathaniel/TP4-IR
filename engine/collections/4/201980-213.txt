Göring made yet another fateful decision : to order more bomber escorts at the expense of free - hunting sweeps . To achieve this , the weight of the attack now fell on Luftflotte 2 , and the bulk of the Bf 109s in Luftflotte 3 were transferred to Kesselring 's command , reinforcing the fighter bases in the Pas - de-Calais . Stripped of its fighters , Luftflotte 3 would concentrate on the night bombing campaign . Göring , expressing disappointment with the fighter performance thus far in the campaign , also made sweeping changes in the command structure of the fighter units , replacing many Geschwaderkommodore with younger , more aggressive pilots like Adolf Galland and Werner Mölders .
