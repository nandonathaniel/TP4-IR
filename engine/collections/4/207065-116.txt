Progressive movement training Progressive movement training attempts to gradually increase the range of motion throughout a training cycle . The lifter will start with a much heavier weight than they could handle in the full range of motion , only moving through the last 3 -- 5 '' of the movement . Throughout the training cycle , the lifter will gradually increase the range of motion until the joint moves through the full range of the exercise . This is a style that was made popular by Paul Anderson .
