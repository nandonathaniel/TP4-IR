Lorenzo Cotula in his book ' Legal Empowerment for Local Resource Control ' outlines the fact that legal tools for securing local resource rights are enshrined in legal system , does not necessarily mean that local resource users are in position to use them and benefit from them . The state legal system is constrained by a range of different factors -- from lack of resources to cultural issues . Among these factors economic , geographic , linguistic and other constraints on access to courts , lack of legal awareness as well as legal assistance tend to be recurrent problems .
