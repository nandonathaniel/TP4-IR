Although party leader Jim Cannon later hinted that the entry of the Trotskyists into the Socialist Party had been a contrived tactic aimed at stealing `` confused young Left Socialists '' for his own organization , it seems that at its inception , the entryist tactic was made in good faith . Historian Constance Myers notes that while `` initial prognoses for the union of Trotskyists and Socialists were favorable '' , it was only later when `` constant and protracted contact caused differences to surface '' . The Trotskyists retained a common orientation with the radicalized Socialist Party in their opposition to the European war , their preference for industrial unionism and the Congress of Industrial Organizations over the trade unionism of the American Federation of Labor , a commitment to trade union activism , the defense of the Soviet Union as the first workers ' state while at the same time maintaining an antipathy toward the Stalin regime and in their general aims in the 1936 election .
