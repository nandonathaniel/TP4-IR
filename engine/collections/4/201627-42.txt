The moretta ( meaning dark one ) or servetta muta ( meaning mute servant woman ) was a small strapless black velvet oval mask with wide eyeholes and no lips or mouth worn by patrician women . It derived from the visard mask invented in France in the sixteenth century , but differed in not having a hole to speak through . The mask was only just large enough to conceal a woman 's identity and was held in place by the wearer biting on a button or bit ( the women wearing this mask were unable to speak , hence muta ) and was often finished off with a veil . The Rhinoceros by Pietro Longhi , sometimes called Clara the rhinoceros , depicts this mask in use in 1751 . It fell into disuse about 1760 .
