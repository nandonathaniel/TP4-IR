According to Julianne Moore , the character of Maude was based on artist Carolee Schneemann `` who worked naked from a swing '' and on Yoko Ono . The character of Jesus Quintana was inspired , in part , by a performance the Coens had seen John Turturro give in 1988 , at the Public Theater in a play called Mi Puta Vida in which he played a pederast - type character , `` so we thought , let 's make Turturro a pederast . It 'll be something he can really run with , '' Joel said in an interview .
