The independent Republic of Kenya was formed in 1964 . It was ruled as a de facto one - party state by the Kenya African National Union ( KANU ) , it was an alliance led by Jomo Kenyatta during 1963 to 1978 . Kenyatta was succeeded by Daniel arap Moi , who ruled until 2002 . Moi attempted to transform the de facto one - party status of Kenya into a de jure status during the 1980s , but with the end of the Cold War , the practices of political repression and torture which had been `` overlooked '' by the Western powers as necessary evils in the effort to contain communism were no longer tolerated .
