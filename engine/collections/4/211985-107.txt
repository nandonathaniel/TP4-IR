They are also allowed passage , but not before Aldebaran instructs them to awaken their Seventh Senses individually and not to underestimate the Gold Saints . The Bronze Saints meet up with Seiya but soon realize they can not go through the House of Gemini and end up back at the entrance . Meanwhile , Aldebaran reveals to Mu that the Bronze Saints were n't the traitors that Pope Arles said they were . They also begin to doubt about the Pope 's intentions .
