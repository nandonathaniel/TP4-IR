Kiel broke into films in the early 1960s with Eegah ( 1962 ) , which was later featured on Elvira 's Movie Macabre and Mystery Science Theater 3000 , as were The Phantom Planet and The Human Duplicators . He also produced , co-wrote , and starred in The Giant of Thunder Mountain . Kiel appeared as the towering -- and lethal -- assistant Voltaire to Dr. Miguelito Loveless in first - season episodes of The Wild , Wild West . He later appeared in the episode `` The Night of the Simian Terror '' as Dimas , the outcast son of a wealthy family , banished because of birth defects that distorted his body and apparently affected his mind . This episode is significant because it allowed Kiel the opportunity to really act rather than just look intimidating . Kiel also had a cameo role in a 1961 episode of The Rifleman .
