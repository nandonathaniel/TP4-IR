Britain defeated France decisively at the Battle of the Plains of Abraham near Quebec City in 1759 , and the Treaty of Paris ( 1763 ) that ended The Seven Years ' War , known in America as the French and Indian War ceded the entire region to the victor . Britain 's claims were intensely disputed by a confederation of Indians during Pontiac 's Rebellion , which induced major concessions to still sovereign Indian nations ; and by the Iroquois Confederacy , whose six member nations - Mohawk , Oneida , Onondaga , Cayuga , Seneca and Tuscarora - never conceded sovereignty to either Britain or , later , The United States .
