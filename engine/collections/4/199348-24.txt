The word fetus ( plural fetuses ) is from the Latin fÄ“tus ( `` offspring '' , `` bringing forth '' , `` hatching of young '' ) . The British , Irish , and Commonwealth spelling is foetus , which has been in use since at least 1594 . The spelling with - oe - arose in Late Latin , in which the distinction between the vowel sounds - oe - and - e - had been lost . This spelling is the most common in most Commonwealth nations , except in the medical literature , where fetus is used . The more classical spelling fetus is used in Canada and the United States . In addition , fetus is now the standard English spelling throughout the world in medical journals . The spelling faetus was also used historically .
