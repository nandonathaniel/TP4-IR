By Craven 's account , his own adolescent experiences led to the naming of Freddy Krueger . He had been bullied at school by a child named Fred Krueger , and he named his villain accordingly . Additionally , Craven had done the same in his earlier film The Last House on the Left ( 1972 ) , where the villain 's name was shortened to `` Krug '' . The colored sweater he chose for his villain was based on the DC Comics character Plastic Man , and Craven chose to make Krueger 's sweater red and green , after reading an article in Scientific American in 1982 that said the two most clashing colors to the human retina were this particular combination .
