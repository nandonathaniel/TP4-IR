In his 1817 Le RÃ¨gne Animal , Georges Cuvier used comparative anatomy to group the animals into four embranchements ( `` branches '' with different body plans , roughly corresponding to phyla ) , namely vertebrates , molluscs , articulated animals ( arthropods and annelids ) , and zoophytes ( echinoderms , cnidaria and other forms ) . This division into four was followed by the embryologist Karl Ernst von Baer in 1828 , the zoologist Louis Agassiz in 1857 , and the comparative anatomist Richard Owen in 1860 .
