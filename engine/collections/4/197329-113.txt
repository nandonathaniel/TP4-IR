The Gibbs energy ( also referred to as G ) is also the thermodynamic potential that is minimized when a system reaches chemical equilibrium at constant pressure and temperature . Its derivative with respect to the reaction coordinate of the system vanishes at the equilibrium point . As such , a reduction in G is a necessary condition for the spontaneity of processes at constant pressure and temperature .
