Captain George Pollard , Jr. returned to sea in early 1822 to captain the whaleship Two Brothers . It was wrecked on the French Frigate Shoals during a storm off the coast of Hawaii on his first voyage , after which he joined a merchant vessel , which was wrecked off the Sandwich Islands ( Hawaiian Islands ) shortly thereafter . By now Pollard was considered a `` Jonah '' ( unlucky ) , and no ship owner would trust him to sail on a ship again , so he was forced to retire . He became Nantucket 's night watchman . Every 20 November , he would lock himself in his room and fast in memory of the men of Essex . He died in Nantucket on 7 January 1870 , aged 78 .
