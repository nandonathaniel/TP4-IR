In 1804 , Karl Rudolphi and J.H.F. Link were awarded the prize for `` solving the problem of the nature of cells '' , meaning they were the first to prove that cells had independent cell walls by the Königliche Societät der Wissenschaft ( Royal Society of Science ) , Göttingen . Before , it had been thought that cells shared walls and the fluid passed between them this way .
