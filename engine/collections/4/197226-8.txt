Enema is a fluid injected into the lower bowel by way of the rectum . The most frequent use of an enema is to relieve constipation or for bowel cleansing before a medical examination or `` procedure '' . In standard medicine an enema may also be employed as a lower gastrointestinal series ( also called a barium enema ) , to check diarrhea , as a vehicle for the administration of food , water or medicine , as a stimulant to the general system , as a local application and , more rarely , as a means of reducing temperature , as treatment for encopresis , and as a form of rehydration therapy ( proctoclysis ) in patients for whom intravenous therapy is not applicable .
