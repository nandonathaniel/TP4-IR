Most law school education in the United States is based on standards developed by Christopher Columbus Langdell and James Barr Ames at Harvard Law School during the 1870s . Professors generally lead in - class debates over the issues in selected court cases , compiled into `` casebooks '' for each course . Traditionally , law professors chose not to lecture extensively , and instead used the Socratic method to force students to teach each other based on their individual understanding of legal theory and the facts of the case at hand .
