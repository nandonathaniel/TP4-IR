The pro-Egyptian NUP boycotted the 1948 Legislative Assembly elections . As a result , pro-independence groups dominated the Legislative Assembly . In 1952 , leaders of the Umma - dominated legislature negotiated the Self - Determination Agreement with Britain . The legislators then enacted a constitution that provided for a prime minister and council of ministers responsible to a bicameral parliament . The new Sudanese government would have responsibility in all areas except military and foreign affairs , which remained in the British governor general 's hands . Cairo , which demanded recognition of Egyptian sovereignty over Sudan , repudiated the co-dominium agreement in protest and declared its reigning monarch , Faruk , king of Sudan .
