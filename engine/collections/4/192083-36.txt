Writer Anthony Synnott placed The Little Girl Who Lives Down the Lane in a trend of sexualizing children in film , calling Rynn the `` murdering nymphet '' and comparing her to Foster 's child prostitute character Iris in Taxi Driver ( 1976 ) . Anthony Cortese also referred to Foster as giving an `` encore performance '' of Taxi Driver , calling Rynn `` a 13 - year - old imp of maturing sexuality '' . Scholar Andrew Scahill described it as fitting a cinematic narrative of children in rebellion , one in which the child appears seemly , as with The Innocents ( 1961 ) , The Omen ( 1976 ) and others .
