Although the word acronym is often used to refer to any abbreviation formed from initial letters , some dictionaries and usage commentators define acronym to mean an abbreviation that is pronounced as a word , in contrast to an initialism ( or alphabetism ) ‍ -- ‌an abbreviation formed from a string of initials ( and possibly pronounced as individual letters ) . Some dictionaries include additional senses equating acronym with initialism . The distinction , when made , hinges on whether the abbreviation is pronounced as a word or as a string of individual letters . Examples in reference works that make the distinction include NATO / ˈneɪtoʊ / , scuba / ˈskuːbə / , and radar / ˈreɪdɑːr / for acronyms ; and FBI / ˌɛfˌbiːˈaɪ / , CRT / ˌsiːˌɑːrˈtiː / , and HTML / ˌeɪtʃˌtiːˌɛmˈɛl / for initialisms . The rest of this article uses acronym for both types of abbreviation .
