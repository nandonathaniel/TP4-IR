To make the comparison more obvious , the opera is set in a pseudo-Wild West America , with Mahagonny itself placed somewhere far from the rest of civilization . America was the land of unbridled capitalism , the frontier just as much so . The only difference is that bourgeois civility and civilization has yet to occupy the frontier , and thus there is no hiding the nature of capitalism beneath the facade of gentlemanly conduct . In Mahagonny , the characters are prostitutes , lumberjacks , criminals , and the like . Not one of them comes from the moneyed class , and yet the same system of exploitation was set up , but in a more naked manner . Instead of seducing a woman 's love with power and influence , the residents of Mahagonny pay for a prostitute . But in Mahagonny , poverty is not just a condition the poor bring upon themselves , but a crime to be punished . Thus , Brecht and Weill tried to display capitalism as the meatgrinder they believed it to be .
