In addition to Golden Gate bridge patrol , law enforcement , and emergency medical personnel , there are Golden Gate Bridge ironworkers who volunteer their time to prevent suicides by talking to or wrestling down suicidal people . One of the ironworkers , Ken Hopper , began working at the bridge in the mid-1980s and sees the volunteer rescue duty as `` part of the job '' . Called `` Cowboys of the Sky '' , they have the equipment and knowledge of the bridge , as well as the experience working at extreme heights , giving them the qualifications to go over the rail and assist those in need . While the experience of the volunteers minimize the danger of falling , there are still risks encountered . Ironworkers have reported knives being pulled on them , seeing loaded guns on would - be jumpers , and having been bitten . When a police psychologist is on scene , they will coach the volunteer rescuers by radio and the ironworkers are provided seminars on suicide prevention . As of 2001 , Hopper reported having rescued 30 suicidal individuals and losing two . He was a first - hand witness to the Steven Page murder / suicide , where a young , distraught father , who had just murdered his wife , threw his toddler - daughter off the bridge and then jumped off the bridge himself .
