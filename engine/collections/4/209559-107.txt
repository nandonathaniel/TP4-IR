A music video for a shortened version of the original song was created in 1983 , featuring military clips with false colour , simple computer - generated graphics such as colour blocks and geometric lines , digitised video of band members at very low resolution and framerate , and a short appearance of the game Zaxxon ( reportedly the Apple II port ) . The colour blocks were created using Peter Saville 's colour - coded alphabet .
