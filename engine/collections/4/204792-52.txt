In Canada , the city of Terrace , British Columbia ( BC ) , celebrates `` Riverboat Days '' each summer . Built on the banks of the Skeena River , the city depended on the steamboat for transportation and trade into the 20th century . The first steamer to enter the Skeena was Union in 1864 . In 1866 Mumford attempted to ascend the river , but it was only able to reach the Kitsumkalum River . It was not until 1891 Hudson 's Bay Company sternwheeler Caledonia successfully negotiated Kitselas Canyon and reached Hazelton . A number of other steamers were built around the turn of the 20th century , in part due to the growing fish industry and the gold rush . For more information , see Steamboats of the Skeena River .
