In the Japanese version of every Dragon Ball anime series and subsequent related media , Goku has been voiced by Masako Nozawa . Toriyama selected Nozawa upon hearing her audition sample , remarking that only Goku could sound like that . Nozawa stated that she was ecstatic when she got the role because she had always wanted to be in one of Toriyama 's works . She said she had to be mindful of the fact that Goku grew up in the mountains and did not know much of the world .

Nozawa explained that she did not read the manga so that she would not know what was coming in the story until recording , making her reactions the same as Goku 's .
