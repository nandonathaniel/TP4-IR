The Uniform Partnership Act ( UPA ) , which includes revisions that are sometimes called the Revised Uniform Partnership Act ( RUPA ) , is a uniform act ( similar to a model statute ) , proposed by the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws ( `` NCCUSL '' ) for the governance of business partnerships by U.S. States . Several versions of UPA have been promulgated by the NCCUSL , the earliest having been put forth in 1914 , and the most recent in 1997 .
