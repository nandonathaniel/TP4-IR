Renaissance theatre derived from several medieval theatre traditions , such as , the mystery plays that formed a part of religious festivals in England and other parts of Europe during the Middle Ages . Other sources include the `` morality plays '' and the `` University drama '' that attempted to recreate Athenian tragedy . The Italian tradition of Commedia dell'arte , as well as the elaborate masques frequently presented at court , also contributed to the shaping of public theatre .
