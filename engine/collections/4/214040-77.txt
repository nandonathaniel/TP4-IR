The entire issue is further complicated by the fact that , at the time , Māori society was an oral rather than literate one . Māori present at the signing of the Treaty would have placed more value and reliance on what Hobson and the missionaries said , rather than the words of the actual Treaty . At the time of the signing by over 600 `` chiefs '' only 12 could sign their own name and most of these had a very shaky , uncertain style indicating inexperience with writing . The rest put an X or drew part of their moko ( personal facial tattoo ) .
