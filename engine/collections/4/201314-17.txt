From 1911 the Isle of Man TT transferred to the much longer Snaefell Mountain Course of 37.40 miles ( current length 37.73 miles ) . The race programme developed from a single race with two classes for the 1907 Isle of Man TT , expanding in 1911 to two individual races for the 350cc Junior TT motor - cycles and the Blue Riband event the 500cc Senior TT race . The race did not take place from 1915 to 1919 due to the First World War . It resumed in 1920 . A 250cc Lightweight TT race was added to the Isle of Man TT programme in 1922 followed by a Sidecar TT race in 1923 .
