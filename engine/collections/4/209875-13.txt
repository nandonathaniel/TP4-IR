It should be fairly obvious that you should not leave your post until someone has come to take your place or until the petty officer of the guard has told you that the watch is no longer necessary . If the person relieving you is late , report it to the petty officer of the watch but do not quit your post . If you become ill and can no longer stand your watch , notify the petty officer of the watch and he or she will provide you a proper relief .
