At Kitcheners ' Wood , the 10th Battalion of the 2nd Canadian Brigade was ordered to counter-attack in the gap created by the gas attack . They formed up after 11 : 00 p.m. on 22 April , with the 16th Battalion ( Canadian Scottish ) of the 3rd Brigade arriving to support the advance . Both battalions attacked with over 800 men , in waves of two companies each , at 11 : 46 p.m. Without reconnaissance , the battalions ran into obstacles halfway to their objective ; engaged in small - arms fire from the wood , they began an impromptu bayonet charge . The attack cleared the former oak plantation of Germans at a 75 - percent casualty rate .
