Eucharistic liturgy and Mass are the terms used to describe celebration of the Eucharist in the Western or Latin liturgical rite of the Catholic Church . The term Mass is derived from the Late Latin word missa ( dismissal ) , a word used in the concluding formula of Mass in Latin : `` Ite , missa est '' ( `` Go , the dismissal is made '' )
