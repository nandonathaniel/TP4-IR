Against Walpole 's wishes , but to George 's delight , Britain reopened hostilities with Spain in 1739 . Britain 's conflict with Spain , the War of Jenkins ' Ear , became part of the War of the Austrian Succession when a major European dispute broke out upon the death of Holy Roman Emperor Charles VI in 1740 . At issue was the right of Charles 's daughter , Maria Theresa , to succeed to his Austrian dominions . George spent the summers of 1740 and 1741 in Hanover , where he was more able to intervene directly in European diplomatic affairs in his capacity as elector .
