Liam Tuohy as Chief Baker Charles Joughin : The baker appears in the film on top of the railing with Jack and Rose as the ship sinks , drinking brandy from a flask . According to the real Joughin 's testimony , he rode the ship down and stepped into the water without getting his hair wet . He also admitted to hardly feeling the cold , most likely thanks to alcohol .
