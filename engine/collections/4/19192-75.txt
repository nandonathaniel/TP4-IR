An extended shutdown initially threatened to force a 26 - month postponement of NASA 's MAVEN mission to Mars . The spacecraft was scheduled to launch on November 18 . If it did not launch by December 7 , Mars will move too far out of alignment with the Earth . The next launch window occurs in 2016 . Bruce Jakosky , who is directing the mission , said that a 2016 launch would be less useful scientifically because the timing would correspond with a low point in the solar cycle . On October 3 , Jakosky reported that NASA had deemed a 2013 MAVEN launch essential to ensuring future communication with current NASA assets on Mars -- namely the Opportunity and Curiosity rovers -- and that spacecraft processing had already been restarted in preparation for an on - time launch .
