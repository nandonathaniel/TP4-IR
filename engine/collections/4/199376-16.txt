The genetic mutations leading to light skin , though partially different among East Asians and Western Europeans , suggest the two groups experienced a similar selective pressure after settlement in northern latitudes . At what point these developments took place for sub-populations of Homo sapiens ( and whether light skin also occurred independently in Homo neanderthalensis ) is under debate . There is a long - standing hypothesis that the selection for lighter skin due to higher vitamin D absorption occurred soon after the Out of Africa migration some time before 40,000 years ago . A number of researchers disagree with this and suggest that the northern latitudes permitted enough synthesis of vitamin D combined with food sources from hunting to keep populations healthy , and only when agriculture was adopted was there a need for lighter skin to maximize the synthesis of vitamin D .
