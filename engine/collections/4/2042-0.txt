In physics , the Coriolis force is an inertial force that acts on objects that are in motion relative to a rotating reference frame . In a reference frame with clockwise rotation , the force acts to the left of the motion of the object . In one with anticlockwise rotation , the force acts to the right . Deflection of an object due to the Coriolis force is called the Coriolis effect . Though recognized previously by others , the mathematical expression for the Coriolis force appeared in an 1835 paper by French scientist Gaspard - Gustave de Coriolis , in connection with the theory of water wheels . Early in the 20th century , the term Coriolis force began to be used in connection with meteorology .
