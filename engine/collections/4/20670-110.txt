Included among the modern legacies of the California Gold Rush are the California state motto , `` Eureka '' ( `` I have found it '' ) , Gold Rush images on the California State Seal , and the state nickname , `` The Golden State '' , as well as place names , such as Placer County , Rough and Ready , Placerville ( formerly named `` Dry Diggings '' and then `` Hangtown '' during rush time ) , Whiskeytown , Drytown , Angels Camp , Happy Camp , and Sawyers Bar . The San Francisco 49ers National Football League team , and the similarly named athletic teams of California State University , Long Beach , are named for the prospectors of the California Gold Rush .
