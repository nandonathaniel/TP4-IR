Verlander won both the 2011 AL Cy Young Award and the AL MVP Award . He was the first pitcher to claim an AL MVP Award since Dennis Eckersley in 1992 , the first starting pitcher to do so since Roger Clemens in 1986 , and the third Tiger starter to do so in franchise history , joining Denny McLain ( 1968 ) and Hal Newhouser ( 1944 , 1945 ) . Verlander unanimously won the 2011 AL Cy Young Award , but won the AL MVP in a much closer vote . Verlander edged out Boston 's Jacoby Ellsbury , 280 points to 242 points , while collecting 13 of 28 first - place votes . He became the second pitcher in baseball history after Don Newcombe to win the Rookie of the Year , Cy Young , and MVP awards in his career .
