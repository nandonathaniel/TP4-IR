The three laws of motion were first compiled by Isaac Newton in his Philosophi√¶ Naturalis Principia Mathematica ( Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy ) , first published in 1687 . Newton used them to explain and investigate the motion of many physical objects and systems . For example , in the third volume of the text , Newton showed that these laws of motion , combined with his law of universal gravitation , explained Kepler 's laws of planetary motion .
