An extensive and colorful physical description of the Buddha has been laid down in scriptures . A kshatriya by birth , he had military training in his upbringing , and by Shakyan tradition was required to pass tests to demonstrate his worthiness as a warrior in order to marry . He had a strong enough body to be noticed by one of the kings and was asked to join his army as a general . He is also believed by Buddhists to have `` the 32 Signs of the Great Man '' .
