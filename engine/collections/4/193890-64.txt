King James 's policies of religious tolerance after 1685 met with increasing opposition from members of leading political circles , who were troubled by the King 's Catholicism and his close ties with France . The crisis facing the King came to a head in 1688 , with the birth of his son , James , on 10 June ( Julian calendar ) . This changed the existing line of succession by displacing the heir presumptive ( his 26 - year - old daughter Mary , a Protestant and the wife of William of Orange ) with young James as heir apparent . The establishment of a Roman Catholic dynasty in the kingdoms now seemed likely . Some Tory members of parliament worked with members of the opposition Whigs in an attempt to resolve the crisis by secretly initiating dialogue with William of Orange to come to England , outside the jurisdiction of the English Parliament . Stadtholder William , the de facto head of state of the Dutch United Provinces , feared a Catholic Anglo -- French alliance and had already been planning a military intervention in England .
