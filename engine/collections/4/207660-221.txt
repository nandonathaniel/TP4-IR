Early Slavic religion was relatively uniform : animistic , anthropomorphic and inspired by nature . The Slavs developed cults around natural objects , such as springs , trees or stones , out of respect for the spirit ( or demon ) within . Slavic pre-Christian religion was originally polytheistic , with no organized pantheon . Although the earliest Slavs seemed to have a weak concept of God , the concept evolved into a form of monotheism where a `` supreme god ( ruled ) in heaven over the others '' . There is no evidence of a belief in fate or predestination .
