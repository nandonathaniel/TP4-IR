`` The House of Blue Lights '' by Freddie Slack and Ella Mae Morse , was recorded on February 12 , 1946 . The song was co-written by Slack with Don Raye , and , like Raye 's `` Down the Road a Piece '' , was later recorded by many rock and roll singers . Morse was one of the first white singers to perform what would now be regarded as rhythm and blues music .
