It looks like a cyclonic storm , similar to a hurricane , but it does not rotate . The cloud appears during the northern summer and at high latitude . Speculation is that this is due to unique climate conditions near the northern pole . Cyclone - like storms were first detected during the Viking orbital mapping program , but the northern annular cloud is nearly three times larger . The cloud has also been detected by various probes and telescopes including the Hubble and Mars Global Surveyor .
