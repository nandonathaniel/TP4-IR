Many subgenres of heavy metal developed outside of the commercial mainstream during the 1980s such as crossover thrash . Several attempts have been made to map the complex world of underground metal , most notably by the editors of AllMusic , as well as critic Garry Sharpe - Young . Sharpe - Young 's multivolume metal encyclopedia separates the underground into five major categories : thrash metal , death metal , black metal , power metal , and the related subgenres of doom and gothic metal .
