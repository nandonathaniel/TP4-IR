Andrew Barker of Variety praised the film for `` never even feigning a lick of seriousness '' . Although he felt the film was too long and the CGI sequences to be inferior to the traditionally animated ones , he said the film would prove `` popular among the franchise 's key grade - schooler and head - shop - owner demographics . '' Michael Rechtshaffen of The Hollywood Reporter was more negative , saying the film 's two animation styles failed `` to create a cohesive whole in spite of all the inspired non sequiturs , '' stating `` the live action / CG stuff never satisfyingly jibes with the traditional nautical nonsense down below . '' He opined that although the film was inferior to the first one , it would likely be a box office success . Barbara VanDenburgh of The Arizona Republic gave the film three - and - a-half stars out of five , saying `` The plot is straightforward , predictable and slight , no more intricate a plot than a 15 - minute TV episode would have . It 's the freewheeling madness of its execution that makes the movie such a trip -- as in acid trip . '' Elizabeth Weitzman of the New York Daily News gave the film four out of five stars , saying `` The spirit of the series remains true : cheerfully random jokes , blink - and - you 'll - miss - them references and , above all , a silly , stubbornly sentimental streak that only the crabbiest cynic could dismiss . '' Colin Covert of the Star Tribune gave the film three out of five stars , saying `` The SpongeBob Movie : Sponge Out of Water weaves a silly -- and often funny -- spell . It 's a scrappy little B - movie that zips along rather entertainingly . '' Jen Chaney of The Washington Post gave the film two out of four stars , saying `` There 's something about this project that , despite checking all of the requisite plot and sensibility boxes , does n't convey as an organic work of SpongeBob - ishness .
