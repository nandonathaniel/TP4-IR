Within Christianity there are a variety of views on the issues of sexual orientation and homosexuality . The many Christian denominations vary in their position , from condemning homosexual acts as sinful , through being divided on the issue , to seeing it as morally acceptable . Even within a denomination , individuals and groups may hold different views . Further , not all members of a denomination necessarily support their church 's views on homosexuality . In the Bible , procreative marriage is presented as `` the norm '' and homosexuality is discussed in the New Testament , but in the twentieth and twenty - first centuries whether or not the Bible condemns homosexuality , and whether the various passages apply today , have become contentious topics .
