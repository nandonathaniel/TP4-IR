In October 2006 the Stern Review on the effect of climate change on the world 's economy was released for the British government . This report recommended a range of measures including ecotaxes to address the market failure represented by climate change with the least amount of economic and social disruption . In response to this report and subsequent pressure from the Kim Beazley led Labor opposition , in December 2006 the Howard Government established the Prime Ministerial Task Group on Emissions Trading , chaired by Peter Shergold , to advise on the implementation of an emissions trading scheme ( ETS ) in Australia . In opposition , Kevin Rudd called for a cut to greenhouse gas emissions by 60 % before 2050 . Both the incumbent Howard Government and the Rudd Labor opposition promised to implement an emissions trading scheme ( ETS ) before the 2007 federal election . Following the release of the final Shergold report , the Howard government committed to introduce an ETS in June 2007 .
