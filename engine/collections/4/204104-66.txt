The name India is derived from Indus , which originates from the Old Persian word Hindu . The latter term stems from the Sanskrit word Sindhu , which was the historical local appellation for the Indus River . The ancient Greeks referred to the Indians as Indoi ( Ἰνδοί ) , which translates as `` The people of the Indus '' .
