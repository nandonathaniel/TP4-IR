Lethal injection was approved by the legislature in 1998 , though those who were sentenced to death before January 1 , 1999 , may request electrocution . In May 2014 , the Tennessee General Assembly passed a law allowing the use of the electric chair for death row executions when lethal injection drugs are not available .
