The number and type of games played varied from episode to episode , yet while some games became more common over time , others faded from use . Some games are based on traditional improv games , with a considerable number brought over from the UK original , including Scenes from a Hat , Greatest Hits , Props , Hoedown , Helping Hands , Questions Only and Party Quirks . Others were new and uniquely created for both the U.S. original format , and the revived show , with several only receiving 1 or 2 playings due to them not having been well received by audiences .
