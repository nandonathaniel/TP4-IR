In October 2016 , Newman released the song `` Putin '' . The Washington Post wrote : `` inspired by the Russian leader 's penchant for bare - chested photo ops and a geopolitical approach that 's somewhat short of soft and cuddly , Newman has crafted a song that tells Putin 's story from multiple perspectives . '' Newman explained that the song was from a new album that would be released in 2017 , but he was putting out this song early because `` I think that people will lose interest after this surfeit of political talk and attention after the election ... I 've got the thing done . I just want to see what happens . I 'm curious to see how the thing is received . ''
