In bacterial meningitis , bacteria reach the meninges by one of two main routes : through the bloodstream or through direct contact between the meninges and either the nasal cavity or the skin . In most cases , meningitis follows invasion of the bloodstream by organisms that live upon mucous surfaces such as the nasal cavity . This is often in turn preceded by viral infections , which break down the normal barrier provided by the mucous surfaces . Once bacteria have entered the bloodstream , they enter the subarachnoid space in places where the blood -- brain barrier is vulnerable -- such as the choroid plexus . Meningitis occurs in 25 % of newborns with bloodstream infections due to group B streptococci ; this phenomenon is less common in adults . Direct contamination of the cerebrospinal fluid may arise from indwelling devices , skull fractures , or infections of the nasopharynx or the nasal sinuses that have formed a tract with the subarachnoid space ( see above ) ; occasionally , congenital defects of the dura mater can be identified .
