Supporting the wire in the drainage table area are a number of drainage elements . In addition to supporting the wire and promoting drainage , the elements de-flocculate the sheet . On low speed machines these table elements are primarily table rolls . As speed increases the suction developed in the nip of a table roll increases and at high enough speed the wire snaps back after leaving the vacuum area and causes stock to jump off the wire , disrupting the formation . To prevent this drainage foils are used . The foils are typically sloped between zero and two or three degrees and give a more gentle action . Where rolls and foils are used , rolls are used near the headbox and foils further down machine .
