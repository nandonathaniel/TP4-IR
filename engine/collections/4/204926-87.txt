The interplay of gender with class and race creates more extensive relationships among masculinities . For example , new information technology has redefined middle - class masculinities and working - class masculinities in different ways . In a racial context , hegemonic masculinity among whites sustains the institutional oppression and physical terror that have framed the making of masculinities in black communities . It has been suggested that historically suppressed groups like inner city African - American males exhibit the more violent standards of hegemonic masculinity in response to their own subordination and lack of control . This idea of marginalization is always relative to what is allowed by the dominant group , therefore creating subsets of hegemonic masculinity based on existing social hierarchies .
