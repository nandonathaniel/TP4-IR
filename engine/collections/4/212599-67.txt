In June 2017 Reuters reported that `` Police were sending corpses to hospitals to destroy evidence at crime scenes and hide the fact that they were executing drug suspects . '' Doctors stated that corpses loaded onto trucks were being dumped at hospitals , sometimes after rigor mortis had already set in , with clearly unsurvivable wounds , having been shot in the chest and head at close range . Reuters examined data from two Manila police districts , and found that the proportion of suspects sent to hospitals , where they are pronounced dead on arrival ( DOA ) , increased from 13 % in July 2016 to 85 % in January 2017 ; `` The totals grew along with international and domestic condemnation of Duterte 's campaign .
