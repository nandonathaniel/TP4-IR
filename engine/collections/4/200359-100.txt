Whom she will she greatly aids and advances : she sits by worshipful kings in judgement , and in the assembly whom she will is distinguished among the people . And when men arm themselves for the battle that destroys men , then the goddess is at hand to give victory and grant glory readily to whom she will . Good is she also when men contend at the games , for there too the goddess is with them and profits them : and he who by might and strength gets the victory wins the rich prize easily with joy , and brings glory to his parents . And she is good to stand by horsemen , whom she will : and to those whose business is in the grey discomfortable sea , and who pray to Hecate and the loud - crashing Earth - Shaker , easily the glorious goddess gives great catch , and easily she takes it away as soon as seen , if so she will . She is good in the byre with Hermes to increase the stock . The droves of kine and wide herds of goats and flocks of fleecy sheep , if she will , she increases from a few , or makes many to be less . So , then , albeit her mother 's only child , she is honored amongst all the deathless gods . And the son of Cronos made her a nurse of the young who after that day saw with their eyes the light of all - seeing Dawn . So from the beginning she is a nurse of the young , and these are her honours .
