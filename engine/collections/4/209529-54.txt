On 11 July 1791 , he was enshrined in the Panthéon , after the National Assembly of France , which regarded him as a forerunner of the French Revolution , had his remains brought back to Paris . It is estimated that a million people attended the procession , which stretched throughout Paris . There was an elaborate ceremony , complete with an orchestra , and the music included a piece that André Grétry had composed especially for the event , which included a part for the `` tuba curva '' ( an instrument that originated in Roman times as the cornu but had recently been revived under a new name ) .
