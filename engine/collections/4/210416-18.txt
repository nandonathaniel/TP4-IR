When the ice melted , the upper Great Lakes emptied into the Niagara River , which followed the rearranged topography across the Niagara Escarpment . In time , the river cut a gorge through the north - facing cliff , or cuesta . Because of the interactions of three major rock formations , the rocky bed did not erode evenly . The top rock formation was composed of erosion - resistant limestone and Lockport dolostone . That hard layer of stone eroded more slowly than the underlying materials . The aerial photo on the right clearly shows the hard caprock , the Lockport Formation ( Middle Silurian ) , which underlies the rapids above the falls , and approximately the upper third of the high gorge wall .
