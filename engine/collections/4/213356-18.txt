The use of multiple middle names has been somewhat impeded recently by the increased use of computer databases that occasionally allow for only a single middle name or more commonly a middle initial in storing personal records , effectively preventing people with multiple middle names from being listed in such databases under their full name . This is worsened by longer compound names , like María del Pilar Pereyra or María de las Nieves García .
