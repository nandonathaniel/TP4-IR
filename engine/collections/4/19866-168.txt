Rheumatoid arthritis is derived from the Greek word ῥεύμα - rheuma ( nom . ) , ῥεύματος - rheumatos ( gen . ) ( `` flow , current '' ) . The suffix - oid ( `` resembling '' ) gives the translation as joint inflammation that resembles rheumatic fever . Rhuma which means watery discharge might refer to the fact that the joints are swollen or that the disease may be made worse by wet weather .
