Paul Ford cites several scholars who have weighed in against this view , and continues , `` most scholars disagree with this decision and find it the least faithful to Lewis 's deepest intentions '' . Scholars and readers who appreciate the original order believe that Lewis was simply being gracious to his youthful correspondent and that he could have changed the books ' order in his lifetime had he so desired . They maintain that much of the magic of Narnia comes from the way the world is gradually presented in The Lion , the Witch and the Wardrobe -- that the mysterious wardrobe , as a narrative device , is a much better introduction to Narnia than The Magician 's Nephew , where the word `` Narnia '' appears in the first paragraph as something already familiar to the reader . Moreover , they say , it is clear from the texts themselves that The Lion , the Witch and the Wardrobe was intended to be read first . When Aslan is first mentioned in The Lion , the Witch and the Wardrobe , for example , the narrator says that `` None of the children knew who Aslan was , any more than you do '' -- which is nonsensical if one has already read The Magician 's Nephew . Other similar textual examples are also cited .
