The very dense soil plagued the first settlers who were using wooden plows , which were more suitable for loose forest soil . On the prairie the plows bounced around and the soil stuck to them . This problem was solved in 1837 by an Illinois blacksmith named John Deere who developed a steel moldboard plow that was stronger and cut the roots , making the fertile soils ready for farming .
