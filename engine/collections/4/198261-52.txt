Some online shops will not accept international credit cards . Some require both the purchaser 's billing and shipping address to be in the same country as the online shop 's base of operation . Other online shops allow customers from any country to send gifts anywhere . The financial part of a transaction may be processed in real time ( e.g. letting the consumer know their credit card was declined before they log off ) , or may be done later as part of the fulfillment process .
