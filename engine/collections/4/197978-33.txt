Whereas in mainland Europe the renaissance preceded the reformation , local conditions in England caused the reformation to come first . The reformation was about allowing the laïty to interpret the Bible in their own way without the intervention of priests , and prefereably in the vernacular . This stimulated the foundation of free Grammar schools - who searched for a less constrained curriculum . Colonialisation required navigation , mensuration , languages and administrative skills . The laïty wanted these taught to their sons . After Gutenberg 1455 had mastered moveable metal type printing and Tyndale had translated the Bible into English ( 1525 ) , Latin became a skill reserved for the catholic church and sons conservative nobility . Schools started to be set up for the sons of merchants in Europe and the colonies too - for example Boston Latin Grammar School ( 1635 ) .
