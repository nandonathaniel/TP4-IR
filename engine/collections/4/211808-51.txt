Roadkill can be eaten , and there are several recipe books dedicated to roadkill . The practice of eating animals killed on the road is often derided , and some people consider it not to be safe , sanitary , or wholesome . For example , when the Tennessee legislature attempted to legalize the use of accidentally killed animals , they became the subject of stereotyping and derisive humor . Nevertheless , in some cultures there is tradition of using fresh roadkill as a nutritious and economical source of meat similar to that obtained by hunting .
