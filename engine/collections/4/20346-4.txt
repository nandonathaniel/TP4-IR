The flag is not distinctive because it contains the national flag of another country in a position of prominence . In particular , the flag is difficult to distinguish from a variety of flags based on the British Blue Ensign , most notably the national flag of New Zealand and the state flag of Victoria . For example , when Australian prime minister Bob Hawke visited Canada in 1984 , Ottawa was decked out with New Zealand flags in his honour . The Australian Monarchist League , during their `` No '' campaign for the Australian republic referendum in 1999 , displayed the New Zealand flag instead of the Australian flag in one of their pamphlets . Again in 2013 , the Australian Monarchist League mistakenly captioned the New Zealand flag as being the Australian flag on their website . In 2018 , a news piece about Australia Day on Nine News Queensland , the background graphics showed New Zealand flags instead of the Australian flags .
