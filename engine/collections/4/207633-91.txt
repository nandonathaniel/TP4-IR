Foss brings further evidence for his `` Redemore '' theory by quoting Edward Hall 's 1550 Chronicle . Hall stated that Richard 's army stepped onto a plain after breaking camp the next day . Furthermore , historian William Burton , author of Description of Leicestershire ( 1622 ) , wrote that the battle was `` fought in a large , flat , plaine , and spacious ground , three miles ( 5 km ) distant from ( Bosworth ) , between the Towne of Shenton , Sutton ( Cheney ) , Dadlington and Stoke ( Golding ) '' . In Foss 's opinion both sources are describing an area of flat ground north of Dadlington .
