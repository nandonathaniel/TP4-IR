An objection not so much to the initiative concept , but to its present implementations , is that signature challenges are becoming a political tool , with state officials and opposing groups litigating the process , rather than simply taking the issue fight to voters . Signatures can be declared void based on technical omissions , and initiatives can be thrown out based on statistical samplings of signatures . Supporters lacking necessary funds to sustain legal battles can find their initiative taken off the ballot .
