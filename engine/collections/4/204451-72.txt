The age - specific death rates are calculated separately for separate groups of data that are believed to have different mortality rates ( such as males and females , and perhaps smokers and non-smokers if data are available separately for those groups ) and are then used to calculate a life table from which one can calculate the probability of surviving to each age . In actuarial notation , the probability of surviving from age x ( \ displaystyle x ) to age x + n ( \ displaystyle x + n ) is denoted n p x ( \ displaystyle \ , _ ( n ) p_ ( x ) \ ! ) and the probability of dying during age x ( \ displaystyle x ) ( between ages x ( \ displaystyle x ) and x + 1 ( \ displaystyle x + 1 ) ) is denoted q x ( \ displaystyle q_ ( x ) \ ! ) . For example , if 10 % of a group of people alive at their 90th birthday die before their 91st birthday , the age - specific death probability at 90 would be 10 % . That is a probability , not a mortality rate .
