On the morning of October 27 , a U-2F ( the third CIA U-2A , modified for air - to - air refueling ) piloted by USAF Major Rudolf Anderson , departed its forward operating location at McCoy AFB , Florida . At approximately 12 : 00 pm EDT , the aircraft was struck by a S - 75 Dvina ( NATO designation SA - 2 Guideline ) surface - to - air missile launched from Cuba . The aircraft was shot down , and Anderson was killed . The stress in negotiations between the Soviets and the US intensified ; it was only later believed that the decision to fire the missile was made locally by an undetermined Soviet commander , acting on his own authority . Later that day , at about 3 : 41 pm EDT , several US Navy RF - 8A Crusader aircraft , on low - level photoreconnaissance missions , were fired upon .
