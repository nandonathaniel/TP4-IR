As the Protestant Reformation of England proclaimed the importance of pious , controlled behaviour in society , it was the tendency of the contemporary Englishman to displace society 's `` undesirable '' qualities of barbarism , treachery , jealousy and libidinousness onto those who are considered `` other '' . The assumed characteristics of black men , or `` the other '' , were both instigated and popularised by Renaissance dramas of the time ; for example , the treachery of black men inherent to George Peele 's The Battle of Alcazar ( 1588 ) . It has been argued that it is Othello 's `` otherness '' which makes him so vulnerable to manipulation . Audiences of the time would expect Othello to be insecure about his race and the implied age gap between himself and Desdemona .
