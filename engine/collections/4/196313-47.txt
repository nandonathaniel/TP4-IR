Rogge commented that Usain Bolt 's gestures of jubilation and excitement after winning the 100 meter in Beijing are `` not the way we perceive being a champion , '' and also said `` that he should show more respect for his competitors . '' In response to his comments , Yahoo Sports columnist , Dan Wetzel , who covered the Games described him as `` ... a classic stiff - collared bureaucrat , '' and further contended that `` ( the IOC ) has made billions off athletes such as Bolt for years , yet he has to find someone to pick on . '' In an interview with Irish Times ' reporter Ian O'Riordan , Rogge clarified , `` Maybe there was a little bit of a misunderstanding . ( ... ) What he does before or after the race I have no problem with . I just thought that his gesticulation during the race was maybe a little disrespectful . ''
