After the losses of Fort Henry and Fort Donelson in February 1862 , Confederate General Albert Sidney Johnston withdrew his forces into western Tennessee , northern Mississippi , and Alabama to reorganize . Johnston established his base at Corinth , Mississippi , the site of a major railroad junction and strategic transportation link between the Atlantic Ocean and the Mississippi River , but left the Union troops with access into southern Tennessee and points farther south via the Tennessee River .
