Old age comprises `` the later part of life ; the period of life after youth and middle age ... , usually with reference to deterioration '' . At what age old age begins can not be universally defined because it differs according to the context . The United Nations has agreed that 65 + years may be usually denoted as old age and this is the first attempt at an international definition of old age . However , for its study of old age in Africa , the World Health Organization ( WHO ) set 55 as the beginning of old age . At the same time , the WHO recognized that the developing world often defines old age , not by years , but by new roles , loss of previous roles , or inability to make active contributions to society .
