Many sports are not recognized as Olympic sports although their governing bodies are recognized by the IOC . Such sports , if eligible under the terms of the Olympic Charter , may apply for inclusion in the program of future Games , through a recommendation by the IOC Olympic Programme Commission , followed by a decision of the IOC Executive Board and a vote of the IOC Session . When Olympic demonstration sports were allowed , a sport usually appeared as such before being officially admitted . An International Sport Federation ( IF ) is responsible for ensuring that the sport 's activities follow the Olympic Charter . When a sport is recognized the IF become an official Olympic sport federation and can assemble with other Olympic IFs in the Association of Summer Olympic International Federations ( ASOIF , for summer sports contested in the Olympic Games ) , Association of International Olympic Winter Sports Federations ( AIOWS , for winter sports contested in the Olympic Games ) or Association of IOC Recognised International Sports Federations ( ARISF , for sports not contested in the Olympic Games ) . A number of recognized sports are included in the program of the World Games , a multi-sport event run by the International World Games Association , an organization that operates under the patronage of the IOC . Since the start of the World Games in 1981 , a number of sports , including badminton , taekwondo , and triathlon have all subsequently been incorporated into the Olympic program .
