Once construction of the building began , it proceeded at a very fast pace . The steel was so meticulously pre-cut that the frame went up at the rate of a floor each week . By February 1902 the frame was complete , and by mid-May the building was half - covered by terra - cotta tiling . The building was completed in June 1902 , after a year of construction .
