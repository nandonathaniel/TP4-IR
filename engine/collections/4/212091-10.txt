Filopodia ( or filose pseudopods ) are more slender and filiform with pointed ends , consisting mainly of ectoplasm . These formations are supported by microfilaments . This is observed in some animal cells , in part of Filosa ( Rhizaria ) , in `` Testaceafilosia '' ( an artificial group including Euglyphida ) , in Vampyrellidae and Pseudosporida ( Rhizaria ) and in Nucleariida ( Opisthokonta ) .
