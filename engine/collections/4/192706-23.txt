A person having a mass of 100 kilograms who climbs a 3 - meter - high ladder in 5 seconds is doing work at a rate of about 600 watts . Mass times acceleration due to gravity times height divided by the time it takes to lift the object to the given height gives the rate of doing work or power . A laborer over the course of an 8 - hour day can sustain an average output of about 75 watts ; higher power levels can be achieved for short intervals and by athletes .
