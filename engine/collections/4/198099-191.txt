On Purim , Ashkenazi Jews eat triangular pastries called hamantaschen ( `` Haman 's pockets '' ) or oznei Haman ( `` Haman 's ears '' ) . A sweet pastry dough is rolled out , cut into circles , and traditionally filled with a poppy seed filling ; this is then wrapped up into a triangular shape with the filling either hidden or showing . More recently , prunes , dates , apricots , apples , and chocolate fillings have been introduced . Among Sephardi Jews , a fried pastry called fazuelos is eaten , as well as a range of baked or fried pastries called Orejas de Haman ( Haman 's Ears ) or Hojuelas de Haman . These pastries are also known as Oznei Haman .
