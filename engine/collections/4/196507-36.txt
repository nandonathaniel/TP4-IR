The white race deems itself to be the dominant race in this country . And so it is in prestige , in achievements , in education , in wealth and in power . So , I doubt not , it will continue to be for all time if it remains true to its great heritage and holds fast to the principles of constitutional liberty . But in view of the constitution , in the eye of the law , there is in this country no superior , dominant , ruling class of citizens . There is no caste here . Our constitution is color - blind , and neither knows nor tolerates classes among citizens . In respect of civil rights , all citizens are equal before the law . The humblest is the peer of the most powerful . The law regards man as man , and takes no account of his surroundings or of his color when his civil rights as guaranteed by the supreme law of the land are involved . It is therefore to be regretted that this high tribunal , the final expositor of the fundamental law of the land , has reached the conclusion that it is competent for a state to regulate the enjoyment by citizens of their civil rights solely upon the basis of race .
