Major represents a product release . These are scheduled 7 -- 8 per year , unlike other software systems where the major version number updates only with substantial new content . Minor is usually 0 . References to version ' x ' or ' x. 0 ' , e.g. 42.0 , refer to this major. minor designation . Build is ever increasing . For a release cycle , e.g. 42.0 , there are several builds in the Canary and Developer period . The last build number from Developer is kept throughout Beta and Stable and is locked with the major. minor for that release . Patch resets with each build , incrementing with each patch . The first patch is 0 , but usually the first publicly released patch is somewhat higher . In Beta and Stable , only patch increments .
