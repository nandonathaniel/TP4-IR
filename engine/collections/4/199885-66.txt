where the angular rotation of the frame is expressed by the vector Ω pointing in the direction of the axis of rotation , and with magnitude equal to the angular rate of rotation Ω , symbol × denotes the vector cross product , vector x locates the body and vector v is the velocity of the body according to a rotating observer ( different from the velocity seen by the inertial observer ) .
