Marcello Lippi stepped down after Italy 's World Cup campaign and was replaced by Cesare Prandelli , although Lippi 's successor had already been announced before the tournament . Italy began their campaign with Prandelli with a disappointing 0 -- 1 loss to the Ivory Coast in a friendly match . Then , during a Euro 2012 qualifier , Italy came back from behind to defeat Estonia 2 -- 1 . In the next Euro qualifier , Italy dominated the Faroe Islands 5 -- 0 . Italy then tied 0 -- 0 with Northern Ireland . Five days later , Italy played Serbia ; however , Serbian fans in Stadio Luigi Ferraris began to riot , throwing flares and shooting fireworks onto the pitch , subsequently causing the abandonment of the game . Upon UEFA Disciplinary Review , Italy was awarded a 3 -- 0 victory that propelled them to the top of their group . In their first match of 2011 , Italy drew 1 -- 1 a friendly with Germany at Dortmund , in the same stadium where they beat Germany 2 -- 0 to advance to the final of the 2006 World Cup . In March 2011 , Italy won 1 -- 0 over Slovenia to again secure its spot at the top of the qualification table . They then defeated Ukraine 2 -- 0 in a friendly , despite being reduced to ten men for the late stages of the match . With their 3 -- 0 defeat of Estonia in another Euro 2012 qualifier , Prandelli 's Italy secured the table lead and also achieved 9 undefeated games in a row since their initial debacle . The streak was ended on 7 June 2011 by Trapattoni 's current charges , the Republic of Ireland , with Italy losing 0 -- 2 in a friendly in Li√®ge .
