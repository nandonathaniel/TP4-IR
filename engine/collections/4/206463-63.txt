The play arguably equates love and sex with death . Throughout the story , both Romeo and Juliet , along with the other characters , fantasise about it as a dark being , often equating it with a lover . Capulet , for example , when he first discovers Juliet 's ( faked ) death , describes it as having deflowered his daughter . Juliet later erotically compares Romeo and death . Right before her suicide , she grabs Romeo 's dagger , saying `` O happy dagger ! This is thy sheath . There rust , and let me die . ''
