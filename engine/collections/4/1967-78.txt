The ship 's passengers brought with them a huge amount of baggage ; another 19,455 cubic feet ( 550.9 m ) was taken up by first - and second - class baggage . In addition , there was a considerable quantity of regular cargo , ranging from furniture to foodstuffs , and a 1912 Renault Type CE Couple de Ville motor car . Despite later myths , the cargo on Titanic 's maiden voyage was fairly mundane ; there was no gold , exotic minerals or diamonds , and one of the more famous items lost in the shipwreck , a jewelled copy of the Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam , was valued at only £ 405 ( £ 36,800 today ) . According to the claims for compensation filed with Commissioner Gilchrist , following the conclusion of the Senate Inquiry , the single most highly valued item of luggage or cargo was a large neoclassical oil painting entitled La Circassienne au Bain by French artist Merry - Joseph Blondel . The painting 's owner , first class passenger Mauritz Håkan Björnström - Steffansson , filed a claim for $100,000 ( $2.4 million equivalent in 2014 ) in compensation for the loss of the artwork .
