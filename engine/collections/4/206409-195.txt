The Tokugawa shogunate rigidified long - existent class divisions , placing most of the population into a Neo-Confucian hierarchy of four occupations , with the ruling elite at the top , followed by the peasants who made up 80 % of the population , then artisans , and merchants at the bottom . Court nobles , clerics , outcasts , entertainers , and workers of the licensed quarters fell outside this structure . Different legal codes applied to different classes , marriage between classes was prohibited , and towns were subdivided into different class areas . The social stratification had little bearing on economic conditions : many samurai lived in poverty and the wealth of the merchant class grew throughout the period as the commercial economy developed and urbanization grew . The Edo - era social power structure proved untenable and gave way following the Meiji Restoration to one in which commercial power played an increasingly significant political role .
