Faris acted for the third time with husband Chris Pratt , following Take Me Home Tonight and What 's Your Number ? , in a segment of Movie 43 , an independent anthology black comedy that featured 14 different storylines , with each segment having a different director . The fim was universally panned by critics , with the Chicago Sun - Times calling it `` the Citizen Kane of awful '' . In the British romantic - comedy I Give It a Year ( 2013 ) , Faris played an old flame of a writer ( Rafe Spall ) who hastily tied the knot . Released shortly after Movie 43 , the film received mixed reviews and was a commercial success in the UK .
