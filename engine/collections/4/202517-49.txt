The third consequence of the Berber revolt was the collapse of the authority of the Damascus Caliphate over the western provinces . With the Umayyad Caliphs distracted by the challenge of the Abbasids in the east , the western provinces of the Maghreb and al - Andalus spun out of their control . From around 745 , the Fihrids , an illustrious local Arab clan descended from Oqba ibn Nafi al - Fihri , seized power in the western provinces and ruled them almost as a private family empire of their own -- Abd al - Rahman ibn Habib al - Fihri in Ifriqiya and YÅ«suf al - Fihri in al - Andalus . The Fihrids welcomed the fall of the Umayyads in the east , in 750 , and sought to reach an understanding with the Abbasids , hoping they might be allowed to continue their autonomous existence . But when the Abbasids rejected the offer and demanded submission , the Fihrids declared independence and , probably out of spite , invited the deposed remnants of the Umayyad clan to take refuge in their dominions . It was a fateful decision that they soon regretted , for the Umayyads , the sons and grandsons of caliphs , had a more legitimate claim to rule than the Fihrids themselves . Rebellious - minded local lords , disenchanted with the autocratic rule of the Fihrids , conspired with the arriving Umayyad exiles .
