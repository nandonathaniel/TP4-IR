In addition , poppy seed consumption does not serve as a defense for heroin consumption . This is because a unique metabolite ( 6 - monoacetylmorphine ) is produced from heroin use that is never produced from consuming any other substance , even other opiates like the ones present in poppy seeds . Modern tests can thus readily determine whether it was heroin or some other opiate that was ingested , should someone who had used heroin try to claim he or she merely ate poppy seeds . It is widely believed that there is no way to distinguish between poppy seeds and any other kind of opiate . However , a study published by the University of Connecticut 's Department of Chemistry proposed that thebaine could be used as a marker of poppy seed consumption . They examined the urine of test subjects given 11 grams of poppy seeds , the urine of heroin users and clean urine spiked with thebaine , as a reference for GC - MS . They also tested street heroin , 1 morphine tablet and 1 codeine tablet . Urine specimens were screened by EMIT and confirmed for thebaine by GC - MS using a solid - phase extraction method . Only the subjects who had consumed the poppy seeds had thebaine in their urine , with concentrations ranging from 2 to 81 ng / mL with a limit of detection of 0.5 ng / mL . Thebaine was not detected in any of the tested powdered drugs ( street heroin , morphine tablet , codeine tablet ) or the urine of the heroin users .
