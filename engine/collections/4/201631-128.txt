In the fall of 1999 , retired Senior CIA Engineering Executive S. Eugene Poteat wrote that he was asked in early August 1964 to determine if the radar operator 's report showed a real torpedo boat attack or an imagined one . He asked for further details on time , weather and surface conditions . No further details were forthcoming . In the end he concluded that there were no torpedo boats on the night in question , and that the White House was interested only in confirmation of an attack , not that there was no such attack .
