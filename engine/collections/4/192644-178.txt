Ducky -- Another triple toy combination : a duck - headed Pez dispenser with a baby doll torso and plunger base . Other than Rockmobile , he is the only one of Sid 's toys that can communicate orally . He and Legs go to the front porch via the vent , and Ducky , suspended from the porch ceiling by Legs , swings toward the doorbell until he finally activates it , giving Woody the signal to release the Frog . Ducky catches the Frog as Legs reels both toys up to safety .
