In 2008 , the Thunderbirds remained in North America , performing in both the United States and Canada . When Quebec City celebrated its 400th anniversary , the Thunderbirds joined the Canadian Forces 's Snowbirds , the British Royal Air Force 's Red Arrows , and the United States Navy 's Blue Angels in a ceremonial flight over Quebec City . Later in the year , the team returned to Canada for two shows in Abbotsford , British Columbia .
