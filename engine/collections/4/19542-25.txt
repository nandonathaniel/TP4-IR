In 2002 , Muse threatened Celine Dion with legal action when she planned to name her Las Vegas show `` Muse '' , despite the band owning the worldwide performing rights to the name . Dion offered Muse $50,000 for the rights , but they turned it down and Dion backed down . Bellamy said `` We do n't want to turn up there with people thinking we 're Celine Dion 's backing band . ''
