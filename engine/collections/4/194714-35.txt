On 30 April 1969 , Harrison overdubbed a new guitar solo on the best take from 31 January . He overdubbed another solo on 4 January 1970 . The first overdub solo was used for the original single release , and the second overdub solo was used for the original album release . Some fans mistakenly believe that there were two versions of the basic track -- based mostly on the different guitar solos , but also on other differences in overdubs and mixes .
