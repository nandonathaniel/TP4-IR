On September 30 , 1989 , thousands of Byelorussians , denouncing local leaders , marched through Minsk to demand additional cleanup of the 1986 Chernobyl disaster site in Ukraine . Up to 15,000 protesters wearing armbands bearing radioactivity symbols and carrying the banned red - and - white Byelorussian national flag filed through torrential rain in defiance of a ban by local authorities . Later , they gathered in the city center near the government 's headquarters , where speakers demanded resignation of Yefrem Sokolov , the republic 's Communist Party leader , and called for the evacuation of half a million people from the contaminated zones .
