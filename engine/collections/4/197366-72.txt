Egan said : `` I love working with Michael Muhney . I heard about him because my mom had watched Y&R before I joined . So when I told her my character was going to be mixed up with Adam , she went , ' Oh ! He is so good , but so bad ' '' . Egan said that her mother `` told me he was a great character , but an evil one , so I was really excited . And now knowing Michael , it has been so much fun . '' She said that `` everyone seems to think we have good on - screen chemistry '' and that `` it 's an interesting energy between Chelsea and Adam being the `` bad guys '' in town . '' Egan said Adam was Sharon 's biggest supporter when Chelsea had Billy 's baby and gave him up .
