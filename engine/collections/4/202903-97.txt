In Lawrence v. Texas ( 2003 ) , the Court struck down a Texas statute prohibiting homosexual sodomy on substantive due process grounds . In Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 's opinion concurring in the judgment , however , she argued that by prohibiting only homosexual sodomy , and not heterosexual sodomy as well , Texas 's statute did not meet rational - basis review under the Equal Protection Clause ; her opinion prominently cited City of Cleburne , and also relied in part on Romer . Notably , O'Connor's opinion did not claim to apply a higher level of scrutiny than mere rational basis , and the Court has not extended suspect - class status to sexual orientation .
