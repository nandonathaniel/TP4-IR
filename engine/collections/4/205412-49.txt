Physical disintegration is the first stage in the transformation of parent material into soil . Temperature fluctuations cause expansion and contraction of the rock , splitting it along lines of weakness . Water may then enter the cracks and freeze and cause the physical splitting of material along a path toward the center of the rock , while temperature gradients within the rock can cause exfoliation of `` shells '' . Cycles of wetting and drying cause soil particles to be abraded to a finer size , as does the physical rubbing of material as it is moved by wind , water , and gravity . Water can deposit within rocks minerals that expand upon drying , thereby stressing the rock . Finally , organisms reduce parent material in size and create crevices and pores through the mechanical action of plant roots and the digging activity of animals . Grinding of parent material by rock - eating animals also contributes to incipient soil formation .
