The NFL 's action also provoked responses from U.S. Senator David Vitter and Congressman Charlie Melancon of Louisiana , among others . Vitter sent a formal letter to NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell criticizing the NFL 's attempt to claim ownership of the chant , informing Goodell he would be printing T - shirts using the phrase , and daring the NFL to sue him . It was later reported that the NFL had responded to Vitter 's letter , stating that it was only seeking to prevent unauthorized uses of `` Who Dat ? '' together with other identifying marks of the Saints .
