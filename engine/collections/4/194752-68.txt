Futur10n ( always spelled as such ) appears in the Boom ! Studios comic series , as part of the first four - issue miniseries Family Matters . He is a robot who , according to Mr. Incredible , is from the 24th Century and makes regular attempts to rule the world from the past , which Mr. Incredible always foils . His chief weapon is his devolution bombs , which turns anything caught in their blast into a more primitive lifeform , so that Futur10n can command their less - advanced minds into obeying his every whim .
