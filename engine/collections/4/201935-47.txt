The city of Great Falls lies atop the Great Falls Tectonic Zone , an intracontinental shear zone between two geologic provinces of basement rock of the Archean period which form part of the North American continent . The city lies at the southern reach of the Laurentide ice sheet , a vast glacial sheet of ice which covered much of North America during the last glacial period . Approximately 1.5 million years ago , the Missouri River flowed northward into a terminal lake . The Laurentide ice sheet pushed the river southward . Between 15,000 BCE and 11,000 BCE , the Laurentide ice sheet blocked the Missouri River and created Glacial Lake Great Falls . About 13,000 BCE , as the glacier retreated , Glacial Lake Great Falls emptied catastrophically in a glacial lake outburst flood . The current course of the Missouri River essentially marks the southern boundary of the Laurentide ice sheet . The Missouri River flowed eastward around the glacial mass , settling into its present course . As the ice retreated , meltwater from Glacial Lake Great Falls poured through the Highwood Mountains and eroded the mile - long , 500 - foot - deep ( 150 m ) Shonkin Sag -- one of the most famous prehistoric meltwater channels in the world .
