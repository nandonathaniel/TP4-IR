By the late 1930s , the economy and Port Adelaide 's form both recovered and after two narrow grand final losses in 1934 and 1935 the club won premierships in 1936 , 1937 and 1939 . During 1939 , Bob Quinn , in his third year as a player for the club , coached the team to a Grand Final win over West Torrens . Many Port Adelaide players also enlisted for military service during this time . In 1941 Port Adelaide suffered its first player casualties from war since World War I with Lloyd Rudd and Jack Wade both killed on the Allies ' front in France . Four more players would be killed through the war : Maxwell Carmichael , George Quinn , Christopher Johnston and Halcombe Brock .
