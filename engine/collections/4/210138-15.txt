The dates of Patrick 's life are uncertain ; there are conflicting traditions regarding the year of his death . His own writings provide no evidence for any dating more precise than the 5th century generally . His Biblical quotations are a mixture of the Old Latin version and the Vulgate , completed in the early 5th century , suggesting he was writing `` at the point of transition from Old Latin to Vulgate '' , although it is possible the Vulgate readings may have been added later , replacing earlier readings . The Letter to Coroticus implies that the Franks were still pagans at the time of writing : their conversion to Christianity is dated to the period 496 -- 508 .
