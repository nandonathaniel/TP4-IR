In the early days of the United Nations , the Soviet Union commissar and later minister for foreign affairs , Vyacheslav Molotov , vetoed resolutions so many times that he was known as `` Mr. Veto '' . In fact , the Soviet Union was responsible for nearly half of all vetoes ever cast -- 79 vetoes were used in the first 10 years . Molotov regularly rejected bids for new membership because of the US 's refusal to admit all of the Soviet republics . Following the dissolution of the Soviet Union , Russia used its veto power sparingly . However , its use of the veto increased in the late 2000s and 2010s , due to a number of resolutions on conflicts which it was involved militarily in including in Georgia , Syria and Ukraine , making it the state which has most frequently used its veto since the dissolution of the Soviet Union .
