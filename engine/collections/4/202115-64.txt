Carson 's work had a powerful impact on the environmental movement . Silent Spring , in particular , was a rallying point for the fledgling social movement in the 1960s . According to environmental engineer and Carson scholar H. Patricia Hynes , `` Silent Spring altered the balance of power in the world . No one since would be able to sell pollution as the necessary underside of progress so easily or uncritically . '' Carson 's work , and the activism it inspired , are at least partly responsible for the deep ecology movement , and the overall strength of the grassroots environmental movement since the 1960s . It was also influential on the rise of ecofeminism and on many feminist scientists .
