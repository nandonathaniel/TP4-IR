The Dutch West India Company introduced slavery in 1625 with the importation of eleven black slaves who worked as farmers , fur traders , and builders . Although enslaved , the Africans had a few basic rights and families were usually kept intact . Admitted to the Dutch Reformed Church and married by its ministers , their children could be baptized . Slaves could testify in court , sign legal documents , and bring civil actions against whites . Some were permitted to work after hours earning wages equal to those paid to white workers . When the colony fell , the company freed the first slaves and some others , establishing early on a nucleus of free negros .
