These early styles had coalesced into a genre by the time the Illinois group Uncle Tupelo released their influential debut album No Depression in 1990 . The album is widely credited as being the first `` alternative country '' album , and inspired the name of No Depression magazine , which exclusively covered the new genre . Following Uncle Tupelo 's disbanding in 1994 , its members formed two significant bands in genre : Wilco and Son Volt . Although Wilco 's sound had moved away from country and towards indie rock by the time they released their critically acclaimed album Yankee Hotel Foxtrot in 2002 , they have continued to be an influence on later alt - country artists .
