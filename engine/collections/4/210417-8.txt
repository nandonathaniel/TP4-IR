A popular series of well - received advertisements uses cavemen as pitchmen . Also developed by the Martin Agency , the ads center on Neanderthal - like cavemen , no different from modern - day individuals ( outside of the somewhat prehistoric facial features ) , encountering either an ad or commercial with the tagline `` GEICO : so easy a caveman could do it , '' followed by their disgust with the supposed stereotype of caveman stupidity . The ads posit a world where cavemen are still alive and active members of society in the present day , behaving and living nothing at all like the stereotypical caveman . The main characters presented in the ads are affluent , educated , and cultured , eating at fancy restaurants , going to exclusive parties , and seeing their therapists ( portrayed in the commercials by two - time Oscar - nominated actress Talia Shire ) . The humor revolves around the relative normality of the cavemen 's presence and their reactions to the stereotype represented in the ads , and their attempts at defending themselves from the stereotype .
