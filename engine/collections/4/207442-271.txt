For the first time , a live audience of fans , mainly from the Los Angeles area sit in as RuPaul and the contestants return for the annual reunion , where RuPaul reveals the winner of the season . The finale episode was taped at the El Portal Theatre in North Hollywood on Wednesday April 25 , 2012 , where three different outcomes were filmed in an attempt to keep the winner from being revealed before the episode aired , as had happened in previous seasons . We find out Latrice Royale is crowned `` Miss Congeniality . '' We also learn that the reason Willam was disqualified was that he was caught having conjugal visits with his husband , who had tracked Willam to the hotel where the contestants were sequestered during production . This is in breach of the clause barring contestants engaging in unauthorized outside contact . Miss Congeniality : Latrice Royale Runners - up : Chad Michaels & Phi Phi O'Hara Winner of RuPaul 's Drag Race Season Four : Sharon Needles
