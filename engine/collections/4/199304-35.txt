Water released from San Luis and O'Neill reservoirs feeds into the San Luis Canal , the federally built section of the California Aqueduct , which carries both CVP and SWP water . The San Luis Canal terminates at Kettleman City , where it connects with the state - built section of the California Aqueduct . With a capacity of 13,100 cubic feet per second ( 370 m / s ) , it is one of the largest irrigation canals in the United States . The Coalinga or Pleasant Valley Canal branches off the San Luis Canal towards the Coalinga area . A pair of separate dams , Los Baños Detenton Dam and Little Panoche Detention Dam , provide flood control in the Los Baños area . The San Luis Drain was a separate project by USBR in an attempt to keep contaminated irrigation drainage water out of the San Joaquin River , emptying into Kesterson Reservoir where the water would evaporate or seep into the ground . Because of environmental concerns , the system was never completed .
