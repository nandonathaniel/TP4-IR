Z Canis Majoris is a star system a mere 300,000 years old composed of two pre-main - sequence stars -- a FU Orionis star and a Herbig Ae / Be star , which has brightened episodically by two magnitudes to magnitude 8 in 1987 , 2000 , 2004 and 2008 . The more massive Herbig Ae / Be star is enveloped in an irregular roughly spherical cocoon of dust that has an inner diameter of 20 AU ( 3.0 × 10 km ) and outer diameter of 50 AU ( 7.5 × 10 km ) . The cocoon has a hole in it through which light shines that covers an angle of 5 to 10 degrees of its circumference . Both stars are surrounded by a large envelope of in - falling material left over from the original cloud that formed the system . Both stars are emitting jets of material , that of the Herbig Ae / Be star being much larger -- 11.7 light - years long . Meanwhile , FS Canis Majoris is another star with infra - red emissions indicating a compact shell of dust , but it appears to be a main - sequence star that has absorbed material from a companion . These stars are thought to be significant contributors to interstellar dust .
