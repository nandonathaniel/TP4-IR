Several truces were observed to recover wounded from no man 's land on the British front , where the Fourth Army had lost 57,470 casualties , of whom 19,240 men were killed . The French had 1,590 casualties and the German 2nd Army lost 10,000 -- 12,000 men . Orders were issued to the Anglo - French armies to continue the offensive on 2 July and a German counter-attack on the north bank of the Somme by the 12th Division , intended for the night of 1 / 2 July , took until dawn on 2 July to begin and was destroyed . Since 1 July 1916 , the cost of the battle and the `` meagre gains '' have been a source of grief and controversy in Britain ; in German and French writing , the first day of the Battle of the Somme has been little more than a footnote to the mass losses of 1914 -- 1915 and the Battle of Verdun .
