The building was originally equipped with white searchlights atop the tower . They saw their first use in November 1932 when they lit up to signal Roosevelt 's victory over Hoover in the presidential election of that year . These were later swapped for four `` Freedom Lights '' in 1956 . In February 1964 , flood lights were added on the 72nd floor to illuminate the top of the building at night so that the building could be seen from the World Fair later that year . The lights were shut off from November 1973 to July 1974 because of the energy crisis at the time . In 1976 , the businessman Douglas Leigh suggested that Helmsley install 204 metal - halide lights , which were four times as bright as the 1,000 incandescent lights they were to replace . New red , white , and blue metal - halide lights were installed in time for the country 's bicentennial that July . After the bicentennial , Helmsley retained the new lights due to the reduced maintenance cost , about $116 a year .
