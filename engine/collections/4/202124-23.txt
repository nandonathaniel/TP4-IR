Disability identity is almost always determined by the particular disabilities that an individual is born with , however it may change later in life if an individual later becomes disabled or when an individual later discovers a previously overlooked disability ( particularly applicable to mental disorders ) , and in some rare cases it may be influenced by exposure to disabled people as with BIID .
