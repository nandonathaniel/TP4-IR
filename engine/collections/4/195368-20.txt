Evaporative cooling is also the last cooling step in order to reach the ultra-low temperatures required for Bose -- Einstein condensation ( BEC ) . Here , so - called forced evaporative cooling is used to selectively remove high - energetic ( `` hot '' ) atoms from an atom cloud until the remaining cloud is cooled below the BEC transition temperature . For a cloud of 1 million alkali atoms , this temperature is about 1Î¼K .
