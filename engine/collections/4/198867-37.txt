A detailed topographic analysis of the Hawaiian -- Emperor seamount chain reveals the hotspot as the center of a topographic high , and that elevation falls with distance from the hotspot . The most rapid decrease in elevation and the highest ratio between the topography and geoid height are over the southeastern part of the chain , falling with distance from the hotspot , particularly at the intersection of the Molokai and Murray fracture zones . The most likely explanation is that the region between the two zones is more susceptible to reheating than most of the chain . Another possible explanation is that the hotspot strength swells and subsides over time .
