The plan to operate independently resulted in significant self - protection requirements and 1 ATF 's initial priorities were to establish a base and ensure its own security . Meanwhile , the decision to occupy Nui Dat rather than co-locate 1 ATF with its logistic support at Vung Tau allowed the task force to have a greater impact but resulted in additional manpower demands to secure the base . Indeed , the security needs of an understrength brigade in an area of strong Viet Cong activity utilised up to half the force , limiting its freedom of action . Jackson was uneasy about the possibility of a concentration against Nui Dat , fearing a major military and political setback if they succeeded in attacking 1 ATF soon after its arrival and caused heavy casualties . He subsequently moved to construct fixed defences and secure the supply route to Vung Tau , as well as implementing a high - tempo patrol program . Although hampered by the monsoon , defensive positions were dug , command posts sandbagged , and living areas built , while claymore mines , concertina wire and other obstacles were laid , and the vegetation cleared out to small arms range . Standing patrols were established outside the base in the evening and clearing patrols sent out every morning and evening along the 12 - kilometre ( 7.5 mi ) perimeter . Daily platoon patrols and ambushes were initially conducted out to 4,000 metres ( 4,400 yd ) , which was the range of the Viet Cong mortars , but were later extended to 10,000 metres ( 11,000 yd ) to counter the threat from artillery .
