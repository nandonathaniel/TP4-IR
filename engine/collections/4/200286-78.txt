Apsidal precession also slowly changes the place in the Earth 's orbit where the solstices and equinoxes occur . Note that this is a slow change in the orbit of the Earth , not the axis of rotation , which is referred to as axial precession ( see Precession ยง Astronomy ) . Over the next 10,000 years , the northern hemisphere winters will become gradually longer and summers will become shorter . However , any cooling effect in one hemisphere is balanced by warming in the other , and any overall change will be counteracted by the fact that the eccentricity of Earth 's orbit will be almost halved . This will reduce the mean orbital radius and raise temperatures in both hemispheres closer to the mid-interglacial peak .
