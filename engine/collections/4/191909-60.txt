The political economy of race had different consequences for the descendants of aboriginal Americans and African slaves . The 19th - century blood quantum rule meant that it was relatively easier for a person of mixed Euro - Amerindian ancestry to be accepted as White . The offspring of a few generations of intermarriage between Amerindians and Whites likely would not have been considered Amerindian ( at least not in a legal sense ) . Amerindians could have treaty rights to land , but because an individual with only one Amerindian great - grandparent no longer was classified as Amerindian , he lost a legal claim to Amerindian land , under the allotment rules of the day . According to Sider 's theory , Whites were more easily able to acquire Amerindian lands . On the other hand , the same individual who could be denied legal standing in a tribe , according to the government , because he was `` too White '' to claim property rights , might still have enough visually identifiable Amerindian ancestry to be considered socially as a `` half - breed '' or breed , and stigmatized by both communities .
