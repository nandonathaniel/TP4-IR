The Harlem Renaissance is generally considered to have spanned from about 1918 until the mid-1930s . Many of its ideas lived on much longer . The zenith of this `` flowering of Negro literature '' , as James Weldon Johnson preferred to call the Harlem Renaissance , took place between 1924 ( when Opportunity : A Journal of Negro Life hosted a party for black writers where many white publishers were in attendance ) and 1929 ( the year of the stock market crash and the beginning of the Great Depression ) .
