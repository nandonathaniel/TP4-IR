Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun - Times gave the film a 3.5 out of 4 , saying `` It 's entertaining as hell '' and it provides `` nearly non-stop action '' . Peter Travers of Rolling Stone gave the film a 3 out of 4 , saying that `` the suspense is killer '' . Henry Barnes of The Guardian considered World War Z an `` attempt at large - scale seriousness '' in the zombie genre , which resulted in a `` punchy , if conventional action thriller . '' Writing for Variety , Scott Foundas thought the film to be a `` surprisingly smart , gripping and imaginative addition to the zombie - movie canon '' , which shows `` few visible signs of the massive rewrites , reshoots and other post-production patchwork . '' Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter opined that `` Brad Pitt delivers a capable performance in an immersive apocalyptic spectacle about a global zombie uprising . '' A.O. Scott of The New York Times said , `` ( It ) does not try to extend the boundaries of commercial entertainment but does what it can to find interesting ways to pass the time within them . '' Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times remarked , `` World War Z plays a bit like a series of separate films and the juncture where the new final act was grafted onto the proceedings is unmistakable , but unless you knew about the film 's troubled past , you 'd never guess it existed .
