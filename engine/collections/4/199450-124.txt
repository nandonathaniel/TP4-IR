Water from the landlocked Czech Republic flows to three different seas : the North Sea , Baltic Sea and Black Sea . The Czech Republic also leases the Moldauhafen , a 30,000 - square - metre ( 7.4 - acre ) lot in the middle of the Hamburg Docks , which was awarded to Czechoslovakia by Article 363 of the Treaty of Versailles , to allow the landlocked country a place where goods transported down river could be transferred to seagoing ships . The territory reverts to Germany in 2028 .
