There are seven housing complexes located on campus for students attending the University Park campus : East Halls , North Halls , Pollock Halls , South Halls , West Halls , Eastview Terrace , and Nittany Apartments . Each complex consists of a few separate buildings that are dormitories and a commons building , which has lounges , the help desk for the complex , mailboxes for each dormitory room , a small food shop , and a cafeteria - style room . Different floors within a building may be designated as a Special Living Option ( SLO ) . SLOs are offered to members of certain student groups ( such as sororities ) , students studying particular majors , students who wish to engage in a particular life style ( such as the alcohol - free LIFE House ) , or other groups who wish to pursue similar goals .
