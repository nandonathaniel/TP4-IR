The 1958 Pakistani coup d'Ã©tat refers to the events between October 7 , when the President of Pakistan Iskander Mirza abrogated the Constitution of Pakistan and declared martial law , and October 27 , when Mirza himself was deposed by Gen. Ayub Khan , the Commander - in - Chief of the Pakistani Army . Pakistan 's first military coup followed a period of prolonged political instability in which Pakistan 's dominant political party , the Pakistan Muslim League , was unable to successfully govern on the basis of shared programs or policies . Broadly , political scientists have argued that the susceptibility of a military system to coups is inversely correlated with the strength of its political parties .
