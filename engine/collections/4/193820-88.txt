In 1995 , Marino broke the career passing records held by Fran Tarkenton for yards ( 48,841 ) , touchdowns ( 352 ) , and completions ( 3,913 ) , though two of the games where he broke those records were losses to the Indianapolis Colts . The Dolphins finished 9 -- 7 , second in the AFC East , but still made the playoffs as a wild card , losing to Buffalo in the first round . Following the 1995 season , Shula retired and became an executive in the Dolphins ' front office . Jimmy Johnson , who had won a collegiate national championship at the University of Miami and two Super Bowls with the Dallas Cowboys , was named as Shula 's replacement . At the press conference announcing his retirement , Shula said that he `` agreed to step aside '' , leading some to speculate that Huizenga had all but fired him .
