Process theories come in four common archetypes . Evolutionary process theories explain change in a population through variation , selection and retention -- much like biological evolution . In a dialectic process theory , `` stability and change are explained by reference to the balance of power between opposing entities '' ( p. 517 ) . In a teleological process theory , an agent `` constructs an envisioned end state , takes action to reach it and monitors the progress '' ( p. 518 ) . In a lifecycle process theory , `` the trajectory to the final end state is prefigured and requires a particular historical sequence of events '' ( p. 515 ) ; that is , change always conforms to the same series of activities , stages , phases , like a caterpillar transforming into a butterfly .
