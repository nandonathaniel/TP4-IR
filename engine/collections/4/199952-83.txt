The late 1940s saw Robert Kelly , son of James Kelly , become chairman of the club after having been a director on the board since 1931 . Desmond White also joined the board around this time , upon the death of his father Thomas White . By the 1950s , a significant number of shares in the club had passed to Neil and Felicia Grant , who lived in Toomebridge , County Antrim . These shares accounted for over one - sixth of the club 's total issue . Club chairman Robert Kelly 's own family share - holding was of a similar size , and he used his close personal relationship with the Toomebridge Grants to ensure his power base at Celtic was unchallengeable . When Neil Grant died in the early 1960s , his shareholding passed to his sister Felicia , leaving her as the largest share - holder in Celtic . This gave rise to the myth amongst Celtic supporters of the `` old lady in Ireland '' who supposedly had the ultimate say in the running of the club .
