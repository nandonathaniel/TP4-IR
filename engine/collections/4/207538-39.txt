While many of the remaining castles in Japan are reconstructions , and most of these are steel - reinforced concrete replicas , there has been a movement toward traditional methods of construction . Kanazawa Castle is a remarkable example of a modern reproduction using a significant degree of traditional construction materials and techniques . Modern construction materials at Kanazawa Castle are minimal , discreet , and are primarily in place to ensure stability , safety concerns , and accessibility . At present , there are local non-profit associations that are attempting to collect funds and donations for the historically accurate re-construction of the main towers at Takamatsu Castle on Shikoku , and Edo Castle in Tokyo .
