Chromophil cells are mostly hormone - producing cells containing so - called chromaffin granules . In these subcellular structures , amino acid precursors to certain hormones are accumulated and subsequently decarboxylated to the corresponding amines , for example epinephrine , norepinephrine , dopamine or serotonin . Chromophil cells therefore belong to the group of APUD ( amine precursor uptake and decarboxylation ) cells .
