Powell 's first film score was for the 1990 film Stay Lucky . He moved to Los Angeles in 1997 , and scored his first major film , Face / Off . This was followed by Antz in 1998 , the first film produced by DreamWorks Animation which he co-scored with fellow British composer Harry Gregson - Williams . Two years later the two collaborated again to compose the score to Chicken Run , and again the following year on Shrek , which won the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature . All subsequent Shrek films however , have been scored solely by Gregson - Williams . During 2001 he also scored Evolution , I Am Sam , Just Visiting , and Rat Race .
