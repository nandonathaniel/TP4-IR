In the ninth month , the First Emperor was interred at Mount Li . When the First Emperor first came to the throne , the digging and preparation work began at Mount Li . Later , when he had unified his empire , 700,000 men were sent there from all over his empire . They dug through three layers of groundwater , and poured in bronze for the outer coffin . Palaces and scenic towers for a hundred officials were constructed , and the tomb was filled with rare artifacts and wonderful treasure . Craftsmen were ordered to make crossbows and arrows primed to shoot at anyone who enters the tomb . Mercury was used to simulate the hundred rivers , the Yangtze and Yellow River , and the great sea , and set to flow mechanically . Above were representation of the heavenly constellations , below , the features of the land . Candles were made from fat of `` man - fish '' , which is calculated to burn and not extinguish for a long time . The Second Emperor said : `` It would be inappropriate for the concubines of the late emperor who have no sons to be out free '' , ordered that they should accompany the dead , and a great many died . After the burial , it was suggested that it would be a serious breach if the craftsmen who constructed the mechanical devices and knew of its treasures were to divulge those secrets . Therefore after the funeral ceremonies had completed and the treasures hidden away , the inner passageway was blocked , and the outer gate lowered , immediately trapping all the workers and craftsmen inside . None could escape . Trees and vegetations were then planted on the tomb mound such that it resembles a hill .
