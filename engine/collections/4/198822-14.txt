Orr started in organized hockey at age five . He first played as a forward , but was moved to defence by his coach , Royce Tennant . Going against the standard practice of the time , Tennant felt Orr 's offensive skills were best suited for a rushing defenceman role and he gave Orr the freedom to play that role despite its inherent risks . With Orr on defence , the Parry Sound Shamrocks had many successes . After Tennant , Bucko MacDonald coached Orr , and Orr continued to excel against small town Ontario provincial competition on defence . At fourteen , Orr joined the Oshawa Generals , the Bruins ' junior hockey affiliate , and he was an all - star for three of his four seasons .
