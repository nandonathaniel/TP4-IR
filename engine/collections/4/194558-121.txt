The Giants beat the Chicago Cubs in the National League Championship Series , four games to one . In Game 1 , first baseman Will Clark hit a grand slam off Greg Maddux in the fourth inning after reading Maddux 's lips telling his catcher which pitch he was going to throw . In Game 5 , Clark , who was the Most Valuable Player in the series for batting . 650 with eight RBIs , came through in the clutch with a bases - loaded , two - out single off hard - throwing lefty closer Mitch Williams to break a 1 -- 1 tie in the bottom of the eighth inning . With two outs in the top of the 9th inning , Giants closer Steve Bedrosian gave up three straight singles and a run before getting the dangerous Ryne Sandberg on a harmless first - pitch groundout straight to Robby Thompson at second , who threw easily to Clark for the final out , stranding the tying run at second , as longtime Giants radio voice Hank Greenwald proclaimed , `` 27 years of waiting have come to an end . The Giants have won the pennant ! ''
