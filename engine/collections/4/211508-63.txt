The concentration of pedestrian and vehicular traffic accessing the beach for recreational purposes may cause increased erosion at the access points if measures are not taken to stabilize the beach surface above high - water mark . Recognition of the dangers of loss of beach front flora has caused many local authorities responsible for managing coastal areas to restrict beach access points by physical structures or legal sanctions , and fence off foredunes in an effort to protect the flora . These measures are often associated with the construction of structures at these access points to allow traffic to pass over or through the dunes without causing further damage .
