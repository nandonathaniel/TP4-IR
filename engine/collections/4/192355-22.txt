The Philippines was mostly LHT during its Spanish and American colonial periods , as well as during the Commonwealth era . During the Japanese occupation the Philippines remained LHT , also because LHT had been required by the Japanese ; but during the Battle of Manila the liberating American forces drove their tanks to the right for easier facilitation of movement . RHT was formally finalised by Executive Order No. 34 signed by President Sergio Osme√±a on 10 March 1945 .
