After Chinese economic reform , more and more artists boldly conducted innovations in Chinese Painting . The innovations include : development of new brushing skill such as vertical direction splash water and ink , with representative artist Tiancheng Xie , creation of new style by integration traditional Chinese and Western painting techniques such as Heaven Style Painting , with representative artist Shaoqiang Chen , and new styles that express contemporary theme and typical nature scene of certain regions such as Lijiang Painting Style , with representative artist Gesheng Huang . A 2008 set of paintings by Cai Jin , most well - known for her use of psychedelic colours , showed influences of both Western and traditional Chinese sources , though the paintings were organic abstractions .
