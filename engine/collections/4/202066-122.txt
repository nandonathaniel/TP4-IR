Similarly , fare evasion was taken seriously . The TA began formally measuring evasion in November 1988 . When TA 's Fare Abuse Task Force ( FATF ) was convened in January 1989 , evasion was 3.9 % . After a 15 - cent fare increase to $1.15 in August 1990 , a record 231,937 people per day , or 6.9 % , did n't pay . This continued through 1991 .
