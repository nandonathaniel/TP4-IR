The Choctaw and the Chickasaw in alliance with the British patrolled the Mississippi and western Tennessee rivers to prevent American incursion along those pathways . The Chickasaw formed part of the garrison of Fort Panmure on the Mississippi and later in Pensacola . Over a thousand Choctaw warriors helped guard the vital ports in West Florida of Pensacola ( seat of the province ) and Mobile against the Spanish . In contrast , a portion of Choctaw supported the Spanish , though never in direct opposition to other Choctaw , while the rest remained neutral .
