While the team 's recent struggles compared to Pittsburgh 's other two teams can be partly to blame ( since the Pirates last World Series championship in 1979 , the Steelers have won the Super Bowl 3 times ( XIV , XL , and XLIII ) and the Penguins the Stanley Cup five times in 1991 , 1992 , 2009 , 2016 , and 2017 , including both in 2009 ) , distractions off the field have also caused the team 's popularity to slip in the city . While the team was ranked first in Pittsburgh as recent as the late 1970s , the Pittsburgh drug trials in 1985 and two relocation threats since are believed to have also seen the team 's popularity dipped . The team 's standing among fans has , however , improved along with the team on the field and the opening of PNC Park in 2001 .
