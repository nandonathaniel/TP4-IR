As part of the transition to Fallon , The Tonight Show would be brought back to New York City after 42 years in Southern California . Approximately $5 million was budgeted to renovate Studio 6B , where Fallon recorded Late Night . The move also enabled NBC to take advantage of a newly enacted New York state tax credit for talk shows that are `` filmed before a studio audience of at least 200 , as long as they carry a production budget of at least $30 million and have been shot outside New York for at least five seasons . '' Studio 6B is also where Jack Paar hosted The Tonight Show . Johnny Carson hosted The Tonight Show there for ten years before the show was moved to Burbank in 1972 . Lorne Michaels ( the producer of Saturday Night Live , in which Fallon appeared prior to hosting Late Night ) became executive producer of The Tonight Show .
