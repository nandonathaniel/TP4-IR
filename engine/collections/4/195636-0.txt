Welding is a fabrication or sculptural process that joins materials , usually metals or thermoplastics , by causing fusion , which is distinct from lower temperature metal - joining techniques such as brazing and soldering , which do not melt the base metal . In addition to melting the base metal , a filler material is typically added to the joint to form a pool of molten material ( the weld pool ) that cools to form a joint that is usually stronger than the base material . Pressure may also be used in conjunction with heat , or by itself , to produce a weld . Welding also requires a form of shield to protect the filler metals or melted metals from being contaminated or oxidized .
