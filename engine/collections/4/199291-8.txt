For unknown reasons , a coup by military leaders called matatoa had brought a new cult based around a previously unexceptional God Make - make . In the cult of the birdman ( Rapa Nui : tangata manu ) , a competition was established in which every year a representative of each clan , chosen by the leaders , would swim across shark - infested waters to Motu Nui , a nearby islet , to search for the season 's first egg laid by a manutara ( sooty tern ) . The first swimmer to return with an egg and successfully climb back up the cliff to Orongo would be named `` Birdman of the year '' and secure control over distribution of the island 's resources for his clan for the year . The tradition was still in existence at the time of first contact by Europeans but was suppressed by Christian missionaries in the 1860s .
