The Nazis seized from the French thousands of locomotives and rolling stock , stockpiles of weapons , and raw materials such as copper , tin , oil , and nickel . Payments for occupation costs were demanded and received from France , Belgium , and Norway . Barriers to trade led to hoarding , black markets , and uncertainty about the future . Food supplies were precarious ; production dropped in most of Europe , but not as much as during World War I. Greece experienced famine in the first year of occupation and the Netherlands in the last year of the war .
