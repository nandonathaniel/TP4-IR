In 1853 William Eddy , the surveyor general of California , identified the lake as Lake Bigler . During the Civil War , Union advocates objected to the name , because Bigler was an ardent secessionist . Due to this , the U.S. Department of the Interior introduced the name Tahoe in 1862 . Both names were in use : the legislature passed legislation declaring the official name to be Lake Bigler in 1870 , while to most surveys and the general public it was known as Lake Tahoe . The lake did n't receive its official and final designation as Lake Tahoe until 1945 .
