Many tempo markings also indicate mood and expression . For example , presto and allegro both indicate a speedy execution ( presto being faster ) , but allegro also connotes joy ( from its original meaning in Italian ) . Presto , on the other hand , simply indicates speed . Additional Italian words also indicate tempo and mood . For example , the `` agitato '' in the Allegro agitato of the last movement of George Gershwin 's piano concerto in F has both a tempo indication ( undoubtedly faster than a usual Allegro ) and a mood indication ( `` agitated '' ) .
