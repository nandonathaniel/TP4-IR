Two other tribes must be noted here . Between 1655 and 1680 , a tribe known as the Westo appeared in the region . It is now believed that they were the remainder of the Erie and Neutral Iroquoian nations who had been pushed out of Ohio during the Beaver Wars . They appeared in West Virginia , driving the Tutelo east to live near the Saponi , then punched straight south , through the Chalaques , settled somewhere around the Yadkin river & began preying on the smaller Siouan tribes of the region . After they were defeated by a coalition led by the `` Sawannos , '' much of the land in North Carolina was reclaimed by its former owners . However , Muskogean people from further south filed north into the southern reaches of this area & reformatted themselves to create the Yamasee Nation .
