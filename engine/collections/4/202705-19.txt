The musical style of Slipknot is constantly contested due to the genres their music covers ; however , Mate . Feed . Kill . Repeat . is the band 's most experimental release and differs significantly from the heavier style for which the band became known . One of the band 's initial aims was to mix many genres of music to achieve their own style ; an early incarnation of the band was called `` Meld '' based upon this . However , there are still similarities in the sound of which Slipknot became known . Tracks such as `` Slipknot '' , `` Some Feel '' and `` Only One '' feature a dominantly heavy metal influence , specifically in that of the guitars . Tracks such as `` Tattered & Torn , '' `` Killers Are Quiet '' and `` Gently '' also include the slow , cerebral angst buildup style that the band retained in some of their more recent work . The album implements elements of jazz and funk , although `` Confessions '' is the only track on the album dominantly led by these styles . The funk metal song `` Do Nothing / Bitch Slap '' is the album 's most complex song , combining both of these dominant styles as well as implementing areas of disco . The album also incorporates elements of death metal . The album title and the majority of the lyrics are references to the role - playing game Werewolf : The Apocalypse . Vocalist Anders Colsefni and percussionist Shawn Crahan shared a mutual interest in the game , which largely influenced the band . Colsefni said : `` The attraction was being able to play a different person '' , declaring that this was the essence of Slipknot .
