Women in Iran are only allowed to sing in chorus , and are not allowed to attend sport stadiums . In 2006 Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , surprisingly , ordered the vice president to allocate half of the Azadi Soccer Stadium to women . Six Grand Ayatollahs and several MPs protested against Mr. Ahmadinejad 's move , and finally the Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei ordered the president to reconsider his order and follow the clergy .
