'' `` ( Lydia 's ) name is an ethnicon , deriving from her place of origin '' . The first refers to her place of birth , which is a city in the Greek region of Lydia . The second comes from the Latin word for purple and relates to her connection with purple dye . Philippi was the city in which Lydia was living when she met St. Paul and his companions . All of these titles expound upon this woman 's background .
