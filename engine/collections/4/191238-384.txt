After the success of Mr. Trash Wheel , the Waterfront Partnership raised money to build a second Water Wheel at the end of Harris Creek , an entirely piped stream that flows beneath Baltimore 's Canton neighborhood and empties into the Baltimore Harbor . Harris Creek is known to carry tons of trash every year . The planned new Water Wheel was inaugurated in December 2016 , and dubbed `` Professor Trash Wheel '' . Professor Trash Wheel prevents waste from exiting the Harbor and accessing the Chesapeake Bay and Atlantic Ocean . A number of additional projects are going on in Baltimore City and County that should result in better water quality scores . These projects include the Blue Alleys project , expanded street sweeping , and stream restoration .
