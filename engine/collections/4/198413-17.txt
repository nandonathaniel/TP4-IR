Draconic months are sometimes known as ' draconitic ' months or nodical months . The name `` draconic '' refers to a mythical dragon , said to live in the nodes and eat the sun or moon during an eclipse . A solar or lunar eclipse is possible only when the moon is at or near the point where its orbit crosses the ecliptic plane i.e. it is at or near one of the nodes .
