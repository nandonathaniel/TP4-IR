Welsh singer and guitarist Dave Edmunds recorded `` I Hear You Knocking '' in 1970 at Rockfield Studios in Monmouthshire . Whereas Lewis 's original recording is a piano - driven R&B piece with a 12 / 8 shuffle feel , Edmunds ' version features prominent guitar lines and a stripped - down , straight - quaver rock - and - roll approach . In an interview , John Lennon commented , `` Well , I always liked simple rock . There 's a great one in England now , ' I Hear You Knocking ' '' .
