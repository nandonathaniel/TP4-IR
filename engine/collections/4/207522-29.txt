A prince has a daughter , Zezolla ( tonnie ) ( the Cinderella figure ) , who is tended by a beloved governess . The governess , with Zezolla 's help , persuades the prince to marry her . The governess then brings forward six daughters of her own , who abuse Zezolla ( tonnie ) , and send her into the kitchen to work as a servant . The prince goes to the island of Sinia , meets a fairy who gives presents to his daughter , and brings back for her : a golden spade , a golden bucket , a silken napkin , and a date seedling . The girl cultivates the tree , and when the king hosts a ball , Zezolla appears dressed richly by a fairy living in the date tree . The king falls in love with her , but Zezolla runs away before he can find out who she is . Twice Zezolla escapes the king and his servants . The third time , the king 's servant captures one of her slippers . The king invites all of the maidens in the land to a ball with a shoe - test , identifies Zezolla ( tonnie ) after the shoe jumps from his hand to her foot , and eventually marries her .
