The effect of the paper was so great that Prandtl became director of the Institute for Technical Physics at the University of GÃ¶ttingen later in the year . Over the next decades he developed it into a powerhouse of aerodynamics , leading the world until the end of World War II . In 1925 the university spun off his research arm to create the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Flow Research ( now the Max Planck Institute for Dynamics and Self - Organization ) .
