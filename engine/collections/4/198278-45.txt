By mid-December 1861 Sherman had recovered sufficiently to return to service under Halleck in the Department of the Missouri . ( In March , Halleck 's command was redesignated the Department of the Mississippi and enlarged to unify command in the West ) . Sherman 's initial assignments were rear - echelon commands , first of an instructional barracks near St. Louis and then in command of the District of Cairo . Operating from Paducah , Kentucky , he provided logistical support for the operations of Brig. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant to capture Fort Donelson ( February 1862 ) . Grant , the previous commander of the District of Cairo , had recently won a major victory at Fort Henry ( February 6 , 1862 ) and been given command of the ill - defined District of West Tennessee . Although Sherman was technically the senior officer at this time , he wrote to Grant , `` I feel anxious about you as I know the great facilities ( the Confederates ) have of concentration by means of the River and R Road , but ( I ) have faith in you -- Command me in any way .
