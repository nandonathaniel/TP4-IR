The college officially opened on October 4 , 1876 with six professors . Forty students were present on the first day of classes , but by the end of the school year the number had grown to 106 students . Only men were admitted , and all students were required to participate in the Corps of Cadets and receive military training . The campus bore minimal resemblance to its modern counterpart . Wild animals roamed freely around the campus , and the area served as a meeting point for the Great Western Cattle Trail .
