The preface to George Bernard Shaw 's On the Rocks includes a dramatization of the meeting between Jesus and Pilate . A song by UK - based songwriter Howard Dobson called This Is Jesus ( King of the Jews ) looks at the Passion of Christ from Pilate 's perspective . In October 2012 , a Spanish journalist speculated on the possibility of Pontius Pilate , as well as some of the soldiers who murdered Jesus , being of Catalan descent . The lyrics of the song `` Elysian Fields '' on the Megadeth album Youthanasia feature the line `` Pontius Pilate is still washing his hands ... '' In 1928 William Percival Crozier published a novel , Letters of Pontius Pilate written during his Governorship of Jud√¶a to his friend Seneca in Rome . Although a work of historical fiction , Crozier 's book is occasionally mistaken for a genuine record of correspondence between Pilate and Seneca .
