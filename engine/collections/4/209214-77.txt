The Normans captured Malta in 1091 , as part of their conquest of Sicily . The Norman leader , Roger I of Sicily , was welcomed by the native Christians . The notion that Count Roger I reportedly tore off a portion of his checkered red - and - white banner and presented it to the Maltese in gratitude for having fought on his behalf , forming the basis of the modern flag of Malta , is founded in myth .
