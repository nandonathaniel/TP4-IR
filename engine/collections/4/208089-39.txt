The `` alleged '' first scholar to make a quantity - theory link between the influx of American `` treasure '' and the Price Revolution was the renowned French philosopher Jean Bodin in his 1568 response to a 1566 treatise by the Royal Councilor Jean Cherruyt de Malestroit . Malestroit argued that lower quality coins were the chief culprit of price influx -- similar to the periodic inflations of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries . Bodin responded by dismissing this argument contending that the growing influx of silver from the Spanish Americas was the primary cause of price inflation . Championed for his `` quantity theory of money , '' Bodin was able to `` demonstrate '' that the inflation of prices in France was due far more to Spanish - American influx than to any change in coin debasement .
