Among the causes of the decline in the population growth rate during the 1920s were a declining birth rate after 1910 and reduced immigration . The decline in immigration was largely the result of legislation in the 1920s placing greater restrictions on immigration . In 1921 , Congress passed the Emergency Quota Act , followed by the Immigration Act of 1924 .
