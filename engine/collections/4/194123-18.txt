Euglenids ( euglenoids , or euglenophytes , formally Euglenida / Euglenoida , ICZN , or Euglenophyceae , ICBN ) are one of the best - known groups of flagellates , which are excavate eukaryotes of the phylum Euglenophyta and their cell structure is typical of that group . They are commonly found in freshwater , especially when it is rich in organic materials , with a few marine and endosymbiotic members . Most euglenids are unicellular . Many euglenids have chloroplasts and produce their own food through photosynthesis , but others feed by phagocytosis , or strictly by diffusion . This group is known to contain the carbohydrate paramylon .
