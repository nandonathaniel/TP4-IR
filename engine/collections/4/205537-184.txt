53 / 11 - 2 Monday , 10 July 2017 Pressure Test : Kylie Millar 's `` Nest '' - Kylie Millar set up a challenging Pressure Test in three hours for Ben , Diana and Eloise to recreate her elaborate 10 - element dessert : `` The Nest '' with 15 minutes to plate it . Both Eloise and Ben struggled in making the honeycomb as well as plating the dish ( the cured egg yolk in particular ) . In the tasting , Diana manage to interpret the dish while both Eloise 's honeycomb and parsnip bark were too bitter along with her gritty panna cotta and Ben 's honeycomb was too chewy . Between the both of them in which their dishes did not score in presentation , the final decision came down to taste . As a result , the bitterness in Eloise 's dish failed to match the flavour profile of the chef 's dish and she was eliminated from the competition . 753,000 # 8
