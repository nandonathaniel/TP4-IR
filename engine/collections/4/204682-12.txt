The poem was translated in Russian by a Soviet writer , translator and children 's poet of Jewish origin , Samuil Yakovlevich Marshak . His translation , however , does not preserve the original prosody and poetic metre , from which we can conclude that the writer was familiar only with the text version of the song .
