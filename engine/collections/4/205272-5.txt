The lecture method is just one of several teaching methods , though in schools it 's usually considered the primary one . The lecture method is convenient for the institution and cost - efficient , especially with larger classroom sizes . This is why lecturing is the standard for most college courses , when there can be several hundred students in the classroom at once ; lecturing lets professors address the most people at once , in the most general manner , while still conveying the information that he or she feels is most important , according to the lesson plan . While the lecture method gives the instructor or teacher chances to expose students to unpublished or not readily available material , the students plays a passive role which may hinder learning . While this method facilitates large - class communication , the lecturer must make constant and conscious effort to become aware of student problems and engage the students to give verbal feedback . It can be used to arouse interest in a subject provided the instructor has effective writing and speaking skills .
