Some States and Territories of Australia retained discriminatory laws relating to voting rights for Aborigines into the 1960s , at which point full legal equality was established . A 1967 referendum to include all Aborigines in the national electoral roll census was overwhelmingly approved by voters . In 1984 , a group of Pintupi people who were living a traditional hunter - gatherer desert - dwelling life were tracked down in the Gibson Desert and brought into a settlement . They are believed to have been the last uncontacted tribe .
