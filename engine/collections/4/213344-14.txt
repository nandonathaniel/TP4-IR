The process of foreclosure can be rapid or lengthy and varies from state to state . Other options such as refinancing , a short sale , alternate financing , temporary arrangements with the lender , or even bankruptcy may present homeowners with ways to avoid foreclosure . Websites which can connect individual borrowers and homeowners to lenders are increasingly offered as mechanisms to bypass traditional lenders while meeting payment obligations for mortgage providers . Although there are slight differences between the states , the foreclosure process generally follows a timeline beginning with initial missed payments , moving to a sale being scheduled and finally a redemption period ( if available ) .
