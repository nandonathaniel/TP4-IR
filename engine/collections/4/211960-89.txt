On January 15 , 1923 , the Post Office issued another 2 Â¢ red Washington postage stamp as part of its new definitive series , thus continuing the tradition of honoring Washington on everyday - use postage . An existing engraving of Washington made for use on the Washington -- Franklin issue was used . That engraving , done by Marcus Baldwin , was modeled from a bust made by Clark Mills in 1853 , which , in turn , was a reproduction of a bust sculpted by Jean Antoine Houdon at Washington 's Mount Vernon home in 1785 . Clair Aubrey Huston designed the stamp 's frame , which was engraved by Edward M. Hall and Joachim C. Benzing .
