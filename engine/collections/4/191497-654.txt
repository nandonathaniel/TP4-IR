Coming out of the locker room , players slap the famous `` Play Like a Champion Today '' sign . Between the third and fourth quarters of home games , the Notre Dame Marching Band plays the finale to the 1812 Overture , as the crowd reacts with synchronized waving of arms , with their fingers in the shape of a `` K '' for Kelly . ( `` W '' for both Weis and Willingham and `` L '' for Lou Holtz ) Since 1960 , Sergeant Tim McCarthy for the Indiana State Police has read out a driving safety announcement to the crowd during the fourth quarter . When Sergeant McCarthy begins his announcement , the crowd goes silent to hear his message , which invariably ends with a pun . Sergeant McCarthy retired from this duty in the 2015 season after 55 years of fan - favorite messages . He was honored on the field on September 26 , 2015 , to deliver his last in - person address , in which he repeated the same announcement he did on his first gameday . At the conclusion of every home game , the team turns to the student section to salute them by raising their helmets in the air . They do this after a win or after a loss . Then , the band plays the Alma Mater , `` Notre Dame , Our Mother '' . Those who stay link arms and sing the lyrics .
