Until 2011 , military service was compulsory for men at age 18 , and conscripts served six - month tours of duty ; conscientious objectors could instead opt for an equal length of Zivildienst ( civilian service ) , or a six - year commitment to ( voluntary ) emergency services like a fire department or the Red Cross . In 2011 conscription was officially suspended and replaced with a voluntary service .
