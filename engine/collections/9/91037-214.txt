The books of the New Testament were all or nearly all written by Jewish Christians -- that is , Jewish disciples of Christ , who lived in the Roman Empire , and under Roman occupation . Luke , who wrote the Gospel of Luke and the Book of Acts , is frequently thought of as an exception ; scholars are divided as to whether Luke was a Gentile or a Hellenic Jew . A few scholars identify the author of the Gospel of Mark as probably a Gentile , and similarly for the Gospel of Matthew , though most assert Jewish - Christian authorship .
