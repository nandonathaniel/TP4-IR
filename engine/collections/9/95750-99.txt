At daybreak on 23 June , the Nawab 's army emerged from their camp and started advancing towards the grove . Their army consisted of 30,000 infantry of all sorts , armed with matchlocks , swords , pikes and rockets and 20,000 cavalry , armed with swords or long spears , interspersed by 300 pieces of artillery , mostly 32 , 24 and 18 - pounders . The army also included a detachment of about 50 French artillerymen under de St. Frais directing their own field pieces . The French took up positions at the larger tank with four light pieces advanced by two larger pieces , within a mile of the grove . Behind them were a body of 5,000 cavalry and 7,000 infantry commanded by the Nawab 's faithful general Mir madan Khan and Diwan Mohanlal . The rest of the army numbering 45,000 formed an arc from the small hill to a position 800 yards ( 730 m ) east of the southern angle of the grove , threatening to surround Clive 's relatively smaller army . The right arm of their army was commanded by Rai Durlabh , the centre by Yar Lutuf Khan and the left arm closest to the British by Mir Jafar .
