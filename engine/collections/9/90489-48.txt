The area in which the city of Fort Lauderdale would later be founded was inhabited for more than two thousand years by the Tequesta Indians . Contact with Spanish explorers in the 16th century proved disastrous for the Tequesta , as the Europeans unwittingly brought with them diseases , such as smallpox , to which the native populations possessed no resistance . For the Tequesta , disease , coupled with continuing conflict with their Calusa neighbors , contributed greatly to their decline over the next two centuries . By 1763 , there were only a few Tequesta left in Florida , and most of them were evacuated to Cuba when the Spanish ceded Florida to the British in 1763 , under the terms of the Treaty of Paris ( 1763 ) , which ended the Seven Years ' War . Although control of the area changed between Spain , United Kingdom , the United States , and the Confederate States of America , it remained largely undeveloped until the 20th century .
