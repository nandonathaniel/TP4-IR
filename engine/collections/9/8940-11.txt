The present Centre Court , built in 1922 upon the move of the Club , was not actually in the centre at the time it was built , but as new courts were added in later years it became a more accurate description . It currently seats 15,000 -- expanded from 14,000 following redevelopment in 2007 -- 08 ( spatially , the expansion is greater than those numbers imply , as seats have been widened ) , and ( as of 2009 ) is the fourth - largest tennis stadium in the world . The Club installed a retractable roof on Centre Court which was completed in May 2009 . It is a ' folding concertina ' made of 5,200 square metres of a translucent waterproof fabric that allows natural light to reach the grass , and opens / closes in under 10 minutes . Redevelopment work commenced in 2006 and Centre Court had no roof at all in place for the duration of the 2007 Championships .
