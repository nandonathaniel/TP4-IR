The oxygenated blood then leaves the lungs through pulmonary veins , which return it to the left heart , completing the pulmonary cycle . This blood then enters the left atrium , which pumps it through the mitral valve into the left ventricle . From the left ventricle , the blood passes through the aortic valve to the aorta . The blood is then distributed to the body through the systemic circulation before returning again to the pulmonary circulation .
