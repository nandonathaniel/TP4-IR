Former Minister of Rural Development Jairam Ramesh said , `` I am surprised by the results , especially in Telangana and Jharkhand . There was clearly a Modi effect . '' At the Congress Working Committee ( CWC ) meeting on 19 May , general secretary Mohan Prakash claimed that Israeli intelligence agency Mossad and the RSS had been working together since 2009 to defeat the UPA government . Prakash further claimed that this was because of Israel 's unhappiness with the UPA government . According to him , this was because the UPA only had limited political relations with Israel , unlike the previous NDA government . Outgoing Finance Minister P. Chidambaram criticised the style of functioning and work culture at the Congress headquarters for the loss , and suggested adopting a more corporate approach . Some Congress members blamed Japanese communication agency Dentsu , which had been hired by the party , at a cost of nearly â‚¹ 6 billion , to handle their election advertising campaign and image makeover of Rahul Gandhi along with another agency Burson - Marsteller . Chairman of the party 's communication department Ajay Maken harshly criticised Dentsu India executive chairman Rohit Ohri for a `` spineless campaign '' . Priya Dutt , Secretary of the party 's communication department , pointed out the gap between the people and the Congress leadership stating , `` We need to bridge that gap . We need to bring that right up to the leadership . There is a lot of criticism . We have to look at where we have gone wrong in the past 10 years . '' DNA described the accusations against Mossad , RSS and Dentsu as `` bizarre theories '' , and noted that `` everyone except vice-president Rahul Gandhi has been held responsible for their crushing defeat .
