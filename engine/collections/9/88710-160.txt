Pet parrots may be kept in a cage or aviary ; though generally , tame parrots should be allowed out regularly on a stand or gym . Depending on locality , parrots may be either wild - caught or be captive - bred , though in most areas without native parrots , pet parrots are captive - bred . Parrot species that are commonly kept as pets include conures , macaws , amazon parrots , cockatoos , African greys , lovebirds , cockatiels , budgerigars , caiques , parakeets , and Eclectus , Pionus , and Poicephalus species . Temperaments and personalities vary even within a species , just as with dog breeds . African grey parrots are thought to be excellent talkers , but not all African grey parrots want to talk , though they have the capability to do so . Noise level , talking ability , cuddliness with people , and care needs can sometimes depend on how the bird is cared for and the attention he / she regularly receives .
