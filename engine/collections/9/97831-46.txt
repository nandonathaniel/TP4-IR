Orzabal , still working with Griffiths and Palmer , released another Tears for Fears album , Raoul and the Kings of Spain , in 1995 . This was a more contemplative work that delved into his own Spanish heritage and showcased a new Latin musical influence ( Raoul was originally the name Orzabal 's parents wanted to give him , and is also the name of his own first son ) . Orzabal stated that it was not a concept album but that there was a theme , namely that of familial relationships . The album also included a reunion with Oleta Adams who duetted with Orzabal on the track `` Me and My Big Ideas '' .
