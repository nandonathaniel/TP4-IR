According to this criticism , the electoral college reduces elections to a mere count of electors for a particular state , and , as a result , it obscures any voting problems within a particular state . For example , if a particular state blocks some groups from voting , perhaps by voter suppression methods such as imposing reading tests , poll taxes , registration requirements , or legally disfranchising specific minority groups , then voting inside that state would be reduced , but as the state 's electoral count would be the same , disenfranchisement has no effect on the overall electoral tally . Critics contend that such disenfranchisement is partially obscured by the Electoral College . A related argument is the Electoral College may have a dampening effect on voter turnout : there is no incentive for states to reach out to more of its citizens to include them in elections because the state 's electoral count remains fixed in any event . According to this view , if elections were by popular vote , then states would be motivated to include more citizens in elections since the state would then have more political clout nationally . Critics contend the electoral college system insulates states from negative publicity as well as possible federal penalties for disenfranching subgroups of citizens .
