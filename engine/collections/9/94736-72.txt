Reef - building or hermatypic corals live only in the photic zone ( above 50 m ) , the depth to which sufficient sunlight penetrates the water , allowing photosynthesis to occur . Coral polyps do not photosynthesize , but have a symbiotic relationship with microscopic algae of the genus Symbiodinium , commonly referred to as zooxanthellae . These organisms live within the tissues of polyps and provide organic nutrients that nourish the polyp . Because of this relationship , coral reefs grow much faster in clear water , which admits more sunlight . Without their symbionts , coral growth would be too slow to form significant reef structures . Corals get up to 90 % of their nutrients from their symbionts .
