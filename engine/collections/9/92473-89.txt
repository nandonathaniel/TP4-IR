Two parallel portions of a circuit attract one another if the currents in them are flowing in the same direction , and repel one another if the currents flow in the opposite direction . Two portions of circuits crossing one another obliquely attract one another if both the currents flow either towards or from the point of crossing , and repel one another if one flows to and the other from that point . When an element of a circuit exerts a force on another element of a circuit , that force always tends to urge the second one in a direction at right angles to its own direction .
