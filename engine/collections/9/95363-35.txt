Because of the doctrine of parliamentary sovereignty , the Supreme Court is much more limited in its powers of judicial review than the constitutional or supreme courts of some other countries . It can not overturn any primary legislation made by Parliament . However , it can overturn secondary legislation if , for example , that legislation is found to be ultra vires to the powers in primary legislation allowing it to be made . Further , under section 4 of the Human Rights Act 1998 , the Supreme Court , like some other courts in the United Kingdom , may make a declaration of incompatibility , indicating that it believes that the legislation subject to the declaration is incompatible with one of the rights in the European Convention on Human Rights . Such a declaration can apply to primary or secondary legislation . The legislation is not overturned by the declaration , and neither Parliament nor the government is required to agree with any such declaration . However , if they do accept a declaration , ministers can exercise powers under section 10 of the act to amend the legislation by statutory instrument to remove the incompatibility or ask Parliament to amend the legislation .
