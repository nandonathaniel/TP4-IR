On July 22 , 2009 , a teaser trailer from the Mad Hatter 's point of view was released on IGN but was shortly taken down because Disney claimed that the trailer was not supposed to be out yet . The teaser was also planned to premiere along with a trailer of Robert Zemeckis ' film adaptation of A Christmas Carol on July 24 , 2009 for G - Force . The following day , the teaser trailer premiered at Comic - Con but the trailer shown was different from the one that leaked . The ComicCon version did n't have the Mad Hatter 's dialogue . Instead , it featured `` Time to Pretend '' by MGMT , and the clips shown were in different order than in the leaked version . The leaked version was originally to be shown to one of the three Facebook groups used to promote the film that had the most members . The groups used to promote the film are `` The Loyal Subjects of the Red Queen '' , `` The Loyal Subjects of the White Queen '' and `` The Disloyal Subjects of the Mad Hatter '' .
