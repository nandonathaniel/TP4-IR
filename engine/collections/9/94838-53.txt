The Weasleys have a special clock in their home , the Burrow , with nine hands , one for every member of the family . Instead of telling the time , the clock reveals the location or status of each family member . The known locations are : Home , School , Work , Travelling , Lost , Hospital , Prison , and Mortal Peril . The Weasleys are the only family mentioned in the series to own such a clock . Dumbledore calls the clock `` excellent '' and seems impressed by it .
