If well used , however , the mirror can aid moral meditation between man and himself . Socrates , we are told by Diogenes , urged young people to look at themselves in mirrors so that , if they were beautiful , they would become worthy of their beauty , and if they were ugly , they would know how to hide their disgrace through learning . The mirror , a tool by which to `` know thyself , '' invited man to not mistake himself for God , to avoid pride by knowing his limits , and to improve himself . His was thus not a passive mirror of imitation but an active mirror of transformation . ( p. 106 )
