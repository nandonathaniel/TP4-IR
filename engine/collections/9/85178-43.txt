Lloyd 's is not an insurance company ; it is a market of members . As the oldest continuously active insurance marketplace in the world , Lloyd 's has retained some unusual structures and practices that differ from all other insurance providers today . Originally created as a non-incorporated association of subscribing members , it was incorporated by the Lloyd 's Act 1871 and is currently governed under the Lloyd 's Acts of 1871 through to 1982 .
