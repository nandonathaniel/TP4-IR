The correct tradeoff can vary due to circumstances . For example , Sun 's Java Virtual Machine has two major modes -- client and server . In client mode , minimal compilation and optimization is performed , to reduce startup time . In server mode , extensive compilation and optimization is performed , to maximize performance once the application is running by sacrificing startup time . Other Java just - in - time compilers have used a runtime measurement of the number of times a method has executed combined with the bytecode size of a method as a heuristic to decide when to compile . Still another uses the number of times executed combined with the detection of loops . In general , it is much harder to accurately predict which methods to optimize in short - running applications than in long - running ones .
