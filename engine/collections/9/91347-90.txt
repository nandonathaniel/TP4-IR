Alexander tried to persuade his soldiers to march farther , but his general Coenus pleaded with him to change his opinion and return ; the men , he said , `` longed to again see their parents , their wives and children , their homeland '' . Alexander eventually agreed and turned south , marching along the Indus . Along the way his army conquered the Malhi ( in modern - day Multan ) and other Indian tribes and Alexander sustained an injury during the siege .
