The soundtrack has been released on CD four times , the first two releases using the original LP masters rather than going back to the original music masters to compile a more complete soundtrack album with underscoring and complete versions of songs . The 1997 Rykodisc release included several quick bits of dialogue from the film between some of the tracks and has gone out of circulation . On 24 February 2004 , a few short months after MGM released the movie on a 2 - Disc Special Edition DVD , Var√®se Sarabande reissued a newly remastered soundtrack album without the dialogue tracks , restoring it to its original 1968 LP format .
