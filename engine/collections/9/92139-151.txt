1595 The Dutchman Jan Huyghen van Linschoten published his Reys - gheschrift vande navigatien der Portugaloysers in Orienten ( Travel Accounts of Portuguese Navigation in the Orient ) which was translated into English and German in 1598 . It gave access to secret Portuguese information , including the nautical maps which had been well guarded for over a century . The book thus broke the Portuguese monopoly on the sea trade with Asia .
