Coding regions are composed of codons , which are decoded and translated ( in eukaryotes usually into one and in prokaryotes usually into several ) into proteins by the ribosome . Coding regions begin with the start codon and end with a stop codon . In general , the start codon is an AUG triplet and the stop codon is UAA , UAG , or UGA . The coding regions tend to be stabilised by internal base pairs , this impedes degradation . In addition to being protein - coding , portions of coding regions may serve as regulatory sequences in the pre-mRNA as exonic splicing enhancers or exonic splicing silencers .
