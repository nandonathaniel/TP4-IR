In the study of revelation East and West have followed different methods , and have developed differently their understanding and confession of God 's truth . It is hardly surprising , then , if from time to time one tradition has come nearer to a full appreciation of some aspects of a mystery of revelation than the other , or has expressed it to better advantage . In such cases , these various theological expressions are to be considered often as mutually complementary rather than conflicting . Where the authentic theological traditions of the Eastern Church are concerned , we must recognize the admirable way in which they have their roots in Holy Scripture , and how they are nurtured and given expression in the life of the liturgy . They derive their strength too from the living tradition of the apostles and from the works of the Fathers and spiritual writers of the Eastern Churches . Thus they promote the right ordering of Christian life and , indeed , pave the way to a full vision of Christian truth .
