The Cheshire Cat effect , as described by Sally Duensing and Bob Miller , is a binocular rivalry which causes stationary objects seen in one eye to disappear from view when an object in motion crosses in front of the other eye . Each eye sees two different views of the world , sends those images to the visual cortex where they are combined , and creates a three - dimensional image . The Cheshire Cat effect occurs when one eye is fixated on a stationary object , while the other notices something moving . Since one eye is seeing a moving object , the brain will focus on it , causing parts of the stationary object to fade away from vision entirely .
