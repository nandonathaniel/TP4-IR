In 89 BC , after the final occupation of the city by Roman General Lucius Cornelius Sulla , Pompeii was finally annexed by the Roman Republic . During this period , Pompeii underwent a vast process of infrastructural development , most of which was built during the Augustan period . These include an amphitheatre , a palaestra with a central natatorium ( cella natatoria ) or swimming pool and an aqueduct that provided water for more than 25 street fountains , at least four public baths , and a large number of private houses ( domÅ«s ) and businesses . The amphitheatre has been cited by modern scholars as a model of sophisticated design , particularly in the area of crowd control .
