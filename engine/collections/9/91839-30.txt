The Undertaker won the match but proceeded afterwards to pull the lever that sent cement into the crypt , completely burying Paul Bearer , suffocating him . ( Bearer was not really at the event . The WWE had recorded footage of Paul Bearer in the crypt before the event . During the event , there was a stunt double in the crypt the whole time . That 's why the television audience could only see Paul Bearer and the crypt he was in -- since he was n't there , they could n't actually show anyone on screen with Bearer ) . This shot ended the pay - per - view and caused numerous complaints toward WWE , as in essence they had shown a simulated murder . The live audience , however , saw an extended ending in which Bearer surfaced for air and was carried from the arena on a stretcher . On the following week 's SmackDown ! , Bearer was acknowledged to be alive , although gravely injured , for storyline purposes . The rehearsal taping earlier in the day of the Bash -- with Undertaker ad - libbing and only half of the stunt complete , in an empty arena -- was leaked onto the internet dirt sheets and actually broadcast live by accident in many of the television markets . As he had two years remaining on his contract , however , Bearer was used as a booker for the company up until WWE decided to terminate his contract on April 11 , 2005 .
