There are notable differences between British and North American ( including Canadian ) cryptics . American cryptics are thought of as holding to a more rigid set of construction rules than British ones . American cryptics usually require all words in a clue to be used in service of the wordplay or definition , whereas British ones allow for more extraneous or supporting words . In American cryptics , a clue is only allowed to have one subsidiary indication , but in British cryptics the occasional clue may have more than one ; e.g. , a triple definition clue would be considered an amusing variation in the UK but unsound in the US .
