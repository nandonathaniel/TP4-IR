Nine Inch Nails ' earliest influences include Ministry and Skinny Puppy , which helped shape what became 1989 's Pretty Hate Machine . The album 's liner notes also paid tribute to the hip - hop group Public Enemy and Prince . Another large influence on the band 's sound is Gary Numan , which is evident as Reznor once said that `` after hearing ' Cars ' I knew I wanted to make music with synthesizers '' . The 2005 single `` Only '' exemplifies the disco - style beats and synthesizers drawn from Numan 's persuasion . Other artists of significance to Nine Inch Nails encompass late 70s and 80s acts such as Queen , Devo , Joy Division , Adam Ant , and Soft Cell .
