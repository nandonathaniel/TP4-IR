Medieval instruments in Europe had most commonly been used singly , often self - accompanied with a drone , or occasionally in parts . From at least as early as the 13th century through the 15th century there was a division of instruments into haut ( loud , shrill , outdoor instruments ) and bas ( quieter , more intimate instruments ) ( Bowles 1954 , 119 et passim ) . Only two groups of instruments could play freely in both types of ensembles : the cornett and sackbut , and the tabor and tambourine ( Burkholder n.d. ) .
