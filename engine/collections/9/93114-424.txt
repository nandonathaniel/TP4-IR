I agree with the current layout of the Evidence basis section as a general discussion of evidence related to naturopathic medicine with subheadings on Skepticism and Vaccination . However , the labels that have been applied to my addition are inappropriate for a few reasons . First , they are used elsewhere in the entry and were allowed by consensus . Second , they do not contradict any of the other information given . The existing discussion of traditional naturopaths and EBM cites an article about Australian naturopaths and a German - language opinion piece . This entry as a whole has been accused of being US - centric , with the resulting problem being that poorly - regulated , potentially unscientific naturopathic practice in other countries might appear stronger than it is in actuality . One of the problems of this topic is that naturopathic practice varies heavily from country to country and no blanket statements can be made . I 'm going to make an edit to clarify this point unless there is further discussion on the talk page . Kpaddock ( talk ) 16 : 59 , 26 October 2009 ( UTC )
