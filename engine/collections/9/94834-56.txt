Henry Barnes of The Guardian gave a mixed review , writing : `` The Place Beyond the Pines is ambitious and epic , perhaps to a fault . It 's a long , slow watch in the final act , a detour into the next generation that sees the sons of Luke and Avery pick away at their daddy issues together . Cianfrance signposts the ripple effects of crime with giant motorway billboards , then pootles along , following a storyline that drops off Mendes and Byrne before winding on to its obvious conclusion . '' A negative review came from Slant Magazine 's Ed Gonzalez , who criticized the film 's plot , themes , `` self - importance '' , shallow characters , and melodramatic nature .
