A similar situation occurred in the neighbouring French Congo . Most of the resource extraction was run by concession companies , whose brutal methods , along with the introduction of disease , resulted in the loss of up to 50 percent of the indigenous population . The French government appointed a commission , headed by de Brazza , in 1905 to investigate the rumoured abuses in the colony . However , de Brazza died on the return trip , and his `` searingly critical '' report was neither acted upon nor released to the public . In the 1920s , about 20,000 forced labourers died building a railroad through the French territory .
