Since Article Three of the United States Constitution stipulates that federal courts may only entertain `` cases '' or `` controversies '' , the Supreme Court can not decide cases that are moot and it does not render advisory opinions , as the supreme courts of some states may do . For example , in DeFunis v. Odegaard , 416 U.S. 312 ( 1974 ) , the Court dismissed a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of a law school affirmative action policy because the plaintiff student had graduated since he began the lawsuit , and a decision from the Court on his claim would not be able to redress any injury he had suffered . However , the Court recognizes some circumstances where it is appropriate to hear a case that is seemingly moot . If an issue is `` capable of repetition yet evading review '' , the Court will address it even though the party before the Court would not himself be made whole by a favorable result . In Roe v. Wade , 410 U.S. 113 ( 1973 ) , and other abortion cases , the Court addresses the merits of claims pressed by pregnant women seeking abortions even if they are no longer pregnant because it takes longer than the typical human gestation period to appeal a case through the lower courts to the Supreme Court . Another mootness exception is voluntary cessation of unlawful conduct , in which the Court considers the probability of recurrence and plaintiff 's need for relief .
