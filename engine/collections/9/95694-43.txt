Of the many forces discussed in this paragraph , tidal force is still highly debated and defended as a possible principal driving force of plate tectonics . The other forces are only used in global geodynamic models not using plate tectonics concepts ( therefore beyond the discussions treated in this section ) or proposed as minor modulations within the overall plate tectonics model .
