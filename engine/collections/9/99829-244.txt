In 1893 , Robert Charles judged Chapter 71 to be a later addition . He would later change his opinion and give an early date for the work between 94 and 64 BCE . The 1906 Jewish Encyclopedia states that Son of Man is found in the Book of Enoch , but never in the original material . It occurs in the `` Noachian interpolations '' ( lx. 10 , lxxi. 14 ) , in which it has clearly no other meaning than ' man ' . The author of the work misuses or corrupts the titles of the angels . Charles views the title Son of Man , as found in the Book of Parables , as referring to a supernatural person , a Messiah who is not of human descent . In that part of the Book of Enoch known as the Similitudes , it has the technical sense of a supernatural Messiah and judge of the world ( xlvi. 2 , xlviii. 2 , lxx. 27 ) ; universal dominion and preexistence are predicated of him ( xlviii. 2 , lxvii. 6 ) . He sits on God 's throne ( xlv. 3 , li. 3 ) , which is his own throne . Though Charles does not admit it , these passages betray Christian redaction and emendation . Many scholars have suggested that passages in the Book of Parables are Noachian interpolations . These passages seem to interrupt the flow of the narrative . Darrell D. Hannah suggests that these passages are not , in total , novel interpolations , but rather derived from an earlier Noah apocryphon . He believes that some interpolations refer to Herod the Great and should be dated to around 4 BCE .
