A cultural context not rank as `` high '' or `` low '' in an absolute sense because each message can be presented on a continuum from high to low . Likewise , a culture ( French Canadian ) may be of a higher context than one ( English Canadian ) but lower context than another ( Spanish or French ) . Likewise , a stereotypical individual from Texas ( a higher - context culture ) may communicate more with a few words or use of a prolonged silence , than a stereotypical New Yorker who is being very explicit , although both being part of a culture which is lower context overall . Typically a high - context culture will be relational , collectivist , intuitive , and contemplative . They place a high value on interpersonal relationships and group members are a very close - knit community .
