Maintenance activities are less than projected . Initially the rails were ground on a yearly basis or after approximately 100MGT of traffic . Ride quality continues to be noticeably smooth and of low noise . Maintenance is facilitated by the existence of two tunnel junctions or crossover facilities , allowing for two - way operation in each of the six tunnel segments thereby created , and thus providing safe access for maintenance of one isolated tunnel segment at a time . The two crossovers are the largest artificial undersea caverns ever built ; 150 m long , 10 m high and 18 m wide . The English crossover is 8 km ( 5 mi ) from Shakespeare Cliff , and the French crossover is 12 km ( 7 mi ) from Sangatte .
