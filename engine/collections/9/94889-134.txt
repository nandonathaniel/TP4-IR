The peace lasted until the death of the childless Edward in January 1066 . His brother - in - law was crowned King Harold , but his cousin William the Conqueror , Duke of Normandy , immediately claimed the throne for himself . William launched an invasion of England and landed in Sussex on 28 September 1066 . Harold and his army were in York following their victory against the Norwegians at the Battle of Stamford Bridge ( 25 September 1066 ) when the news reached him . He decided to set out without delay and confront the Norman army in Sussex so marched southwards at once , despite the army not being properly rested following the battle with the Norwegians . The armies of Harold and William faced each other at the Battle of Hastings ( 14 October 1066 ) , in which the English army , or Fyrd , was defeated , Harold and his two brothers were slain , and William emerged as victor . William was then able to conquer England with little further opposition . He was not , however , planning to absorb the Kingdom into the Duchy of Normandy . As a mere duke , William owed allegiance to Philip I of France , whereas in the independent Kingdom of England he could rule without interference . He was crowned on 25 December 1066 in Westminster Abbey , London .
