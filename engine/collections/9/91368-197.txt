Beauty and the Beast : Original Motion Picture Soundtrack continues to be best remembered for spawning the Dion - Bryson single , which established itself as an instant classic . The success of song is believed to have established Dion as a bankable recording artist . Before agreeing to record `` Beauty and the Beast '' , Dion had been fired from recording the theme song of An American Tail : Fievel Goes West in favor of the more well - known Linda Ronstadt . Although both singles were released around the same time , the success of Dion 's song ultimately eclipsed Ronstadt 's `` Dreams to Dream '' . Biography.com referred to `` Beauty and the Beast '' as Dion 's `` real breakthrough into pop music stardom . '' According to Lifetime , the song `` cemented her international success , '' while People wrote that the release of `` Beauty and the Beast '' is when the singer truly went `` global . '' In the wake of `` Beauty and the Beast '' 's success , young fans who had not yet learned Dion 's name would simply refer to her as `` Beauty and the Beast '' . The commercial success of `` Beauty and the Beast '' ultimately earned Dion a $10 million recording contract with Sony Music International ; the song was then included on Dion 's successful self - titled studio album , serving as the record 's `` cornerstone '' . American musician Prince was so moved by Dion 's performance on `` Beauty and the Beast '' after hearing it on the radio that he personally wrote a song for her to include on the album . According to Filmtracks.com , `` Beauty and the Beast '' offered `` a glimpse at a forthcoming mega-movie song presence for Celine Dion . '' Evidently , the singer has since recorded the theme songs of several blockbuster films , including `` When I Fall in Love '' from Sleepless in Seattle ( 1993 ) , `` Because You Loved Me '' from Up Close & Personal ( 1996 ) and finally her signature song `` My Heart Will Go On '' from Titanic ( 1997 ) . `` Beauty and the Beast '' has since appeared on several of Dion 's greatest hits albums , while the singer has returned to Disney as a special guest to host various segments for certain Beauty and the Beast re-releases .
