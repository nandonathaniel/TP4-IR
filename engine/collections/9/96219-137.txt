Children are a special population when considering Emergency preparedness and many resources are directly focused on supporting them . SAMHSA has list of tips for talking to children during infectious disease outbreaks , to include being a good listener , encouraging children to ask questions and modeling self - care by setting routines , eating healthy meals , getting enough sleep and taking deep breaths to handle stress . FEMA has similar advice , noting that `` Disasters can leave children feeling frightened , confused , and insecure '' whether a child has experienced it first hand , had it happen to a friend or simply saw it on television . In the same publication , FEMA further notes , `` Preparing for disaster helps everyone in the family accept the fact that disasters do happen , and provides an opportunity to identify and collect the resources needed to meet basic needs after disaster . Preparation helps ; when people feel prepared , they cope better and so do children . ''
