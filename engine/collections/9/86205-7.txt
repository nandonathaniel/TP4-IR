British control of trade , and exports of cheap Manchester cotton are cited as significant factors , though Indian textiles had still maintained a competitive price advantage compared to British textiles until the 19th century . Several historians point to the colonization of India as a major factor in both India 's deindustrialization and Britain 's Industrial Revolution . British colonization forced open the large Indian market to British goods , which could be sold in India without any tariffs or duties , compared to local Indian producers who were heavily taxed . In Britain protectionist policies such as bans and high tariffs were implemented to restrict Indian textiles from being sold there , whereas raw cotton was imported from India without tariffs to British factories which manufactured textiles . British economic policies gave them a monopoly over India 's large market and raw materials such as cotton . India served as both a significant supplier of raw goods to British manufacturers and a large captive market for British manufactured goods .
