While the product catalog varies significantly by country , PepsiCo divides its snack products into two primary brand categories : those produced within North America , and those produced outside of North America . In certain regions of the world , the company 's snack food products are produced under regionally specific names such as Sabritas and Walkers . The primary snack food brands and products produced under the Frito - Lay name include Fritos corn chips , Cheetos cheese - flavored snacks , Doritos and Tostitos tortilla chips , Lay 's potato chips , Ruffles chips , and Walker 's potato crisps ( distributed in the UK and Ireland under the Walker 's brand and in the rest of Europe under the Lay 's brand ) -- each of which generated annual worldwide sales over $1 billion in 2009 . Frito - Lay also comprises multiple brands outside of the chip category , including Rold Gold pretzels , Cracker Jack popcorn snacks , and TrueNorth nut clusters and nut crisps . In India , Frito - Lay uses its international brands as well as Uncle Chipps , a homegrown brand that it bought out in 2000 . Kurkure , Indian snack developed and produced by PepsiCo India on March 31 announced that it was now available in Canada , UAE , and Gulf region as well .
