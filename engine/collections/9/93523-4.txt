Bolivia hosts numerous active and extinct volcanoes across its territory . The active volcanoes are located in western Bolivia where they make up the Cordillera Occidental , the western limit of the Altiplano plateau . Many of the active volcanoes are international mountains shared with Chile . All Cenozoic volcanoes of Bolivia are part of the Central Volcanic Zone ( CVZ ) of the Andean Volcanic Belt that results due to processes involved in the subduction of the Nazca Plate under the South American Plate . The Central Volcanic Zone is a major upper Cenozoic volcanic province . Apart from Andean volcanoes , the geology of Bolivia hosts the remnants of ancient volcanoes around the Precambrian Guapor√© Shield in the eastern part of the country .
