In the offseason , O'Neal left as a free agent to the Los Angeles Lakers , dealing a huge blow to the Magic franchise . In the middle of the season , urged by player discontent , management fired coach Brian Hill and named Richie Adubato as interim coach for the rest of the season . Under Adubato , the Magic went 21 -- 12 to compile a 45 -- 37 record , led by Penny Hardaway . In the playoffs , the Magic quickly fell 0 -- 2 to the heavily favored Miami Heat in the first round , but Hardaway battled back with consecutive 40 point games to assure a game five ( the first player to do so ) , which the Magic ultimately lost .
