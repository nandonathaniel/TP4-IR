Two years later , in 1452 , Richard of York returned to England from his new post as Lieutenant of Ireland and marched on London , demanding Somerset 's removal and reform of the government . At this stage , few of the nobles supported such drastic action , and York was forced to submit to superior force at Blackheath . He was imprisoned for much of 1452 and 1453 but was released after swearing not to take arms against the court .
