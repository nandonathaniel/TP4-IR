All committees have an allotted budget to which they must adhere . Any committee may start a project . If a project 's spending becomes too much for a committee to continue funding , it must take the issue to the Project Committee . The project committee either increases the budget or decides on an external funding plan . The Bureau and Executive Committee oversee operations of the other committees .
