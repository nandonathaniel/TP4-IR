Some sources claim that from the 9th century , oil fields were exploited in the area around modern Baku , Azerbaijan , to produce naphtha for the petroleum industry . These places were described by Marco Polo in the 13th century , who described the output of those oil wells as hundreds of shiploads . When Marco Polo in 1264 visited Baku , on the shores of the Caspian Sea , he saw oil being collected from seeps . He wrote that `` on the confines toward Geirgine there is a fountain from which oil springs in great abundance , in as much as a hundred shiploads might be taken from it at one time . ''
