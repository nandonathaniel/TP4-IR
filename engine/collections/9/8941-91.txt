Other objections were voiced as well . Joseph P. Kennedy , the American Ambassador to Great Britain , wrote to Capra and Columbia head Harry Cohn to say that he feared the film would damage `` America 's prestige in Europe '' , and because of this urged that it be withdrawn from European release . Capra and Cohn responded , citing the film 's review , which mollified Kennedy to the extent that he never followed up , although he privately still had doubts about the film .
