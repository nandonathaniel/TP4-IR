The settlement of Natchitoches ( along the Red River in present - day northwest Louisiana ) was established in 1714 by Louis Juchereau de St. Denis , making it the oldest permanent European settlement in the modern state of Louisiana . The French settlement had two purposes : to establish trade with the Spanish in Texas via the Old San Antonio Road , and to deter Spanish advances into Louisiana . The settlement soon became a flourishing river port and crossroads , giving rise to vast cotton kingdoms along the river that were worked by imported African slaves . Over time , planters developed large plantations and built fine homes in a growing town . This became a pattern repeated in New Orleans and other places , although the commodity crop in the south was primarily sugar cane .
