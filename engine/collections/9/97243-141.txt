For most of its early history , the RMB was pegged to the U.S. dollar at ¥ 2.46 per USD ( note : during the 1970s , it was revalued until it reached ¥ 1.50 per USD in 1980 ) . When China 's economy gradually opened in the 1980s , the RMB was devalued in order to improve the competitiveness of Chinese exports . Thus , the official exchange rate increased from ¥ 1.50 in 1980 to ¥ 8.62 by 1994 ( the lowest rate on record ) . Improving current account balance during the latter half of the 1990s enabled the Chinese government to maintain a peg of ¥ 8.27 per USD from 1997 to 2005 .
