The 1938 minimum wage law only applied to `` employees engaged in interstate commerce or in the production of goods for interstate commerce , '' but in amendments in 1961 and 1966 , the federal minimum wage was extended ( with slightly different rates ) to employees in large retail and service enterprises , local transportation and construction , state and local government employees , as well as other smaller expansions ; a grandfather clause in 1990 drew most employees into the purview of federal minimum wage policy , which now set the wage at $3.80 .
