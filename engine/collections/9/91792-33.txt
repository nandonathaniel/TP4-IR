Meat Loaf believed that the lyrics were unambiguous , but Steinman predicted that they would cause confusion . An early episode of the VH1 program Pop - up Video made this claim at the end of the song 's video : `` Exactly what Meat Loaf wo n't do for love remains a mystery to this day . '' A reviewer writing for AllMusic commented that `` The lyrics build suspense by portraying a romance - consumed lover who pledges to do anything in the name of love except ' that , ' a mysterious thing that he will not specify . '' Frank O'day says the lyrics provide `` an enlightening example of how listeners project their own thoughts , values , and concerns onto the meaning of the song with misconstrued lyrics . ''
