After the Roman Emperor Constantine the Great legalized Christianity ( with the Edict of Milan ) , he summoned the First Ecumenical Council at Nicaea in 325 . The bishops at the council confirmed the position of the metropolitan sees of Rome and Alexandria as having authority outside their own province , and also the existing privileges of the churches in Antioch and the other provinces . These sees were later called Patriarchates . These were given an order of precedence : Rome , as capital of the empire was naturally given first place , then came Alexandria and Antioch . In a separate canon the Council also approved the special honor given to Jerusalem over other sees subject to the same metropolitan .
