At the Battle of Pulo Aura , which was probably the company 's most notable naval victory , Nathaniel Dance , Commodore of a convoy of Indiamen and sailing aboard the Warley , led several Indiamen in a skirmish with a French squadron , driving them off . Some six years earlier , on 28 January 1797 , five Indiamen , the Woodford , under Captain Charles Lennox , the Taunton - Castle , Captain Edward Studd , Canton , Captain Abel Vyvyan , Boddam , Captain George Palmer , and ( ( ship Ocean 1788 EIC ship 2 ) ) , Captain John Christian Lochner , had encountered Admiral de Sercey and his squadron of frigates . On this occasion the Indiamen also succeeded in bluffing their way to safety , and without any shots even being fired . Lastly , on 15 June 1795 , the General Goddard played a large role in the capture of seven Dutch East Indiamen off St Helena .
