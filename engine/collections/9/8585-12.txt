Augustine of Hippo ( 354 -- 430 ) taught that Adam 's sin is transmitted by concupiscence , or `` hurtful desire '' , resulting in humanity becoming a massa damnata ( mass of perdition , condemned crowd ) , with much enfeebled , though not destroyed , freedom of will . When Adam sinned , human nature was thenceforth transformed . Adam and Eve , via sexual reproduction , recreated human nature . Their descendants now live in sin , in the form of concupiscence , a term Augustine used in a metaphysical , not a psychological sense . Augustine insisted that concupiscence was not a being but a bad quality , the privation of good or a wound . He admitted that sexual concupiscence ( libido ) might have been present in the perfect human nature in paradise , and that only later it became disobedient to human will as a result of the first couple 's disobedience to God 's will in the original sin . In Augustine 's view ( termed `` Realism '' ) , all of humanity was really present in Adam when he sinned , and therefore all have sinned . Original sin , according to Augustine , consists of the guilt of Adam which all humans inherit . Justo Gonzalez interprets Augustine 's teaching that humans are utterly depraved in nature and grace is irresistible , results in conversion , and leads to perseverance .
