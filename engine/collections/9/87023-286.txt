Loyalty marketing programs are built on the insight that it costs 5 - 20 times more to acquire a new customer than to retain an existing customer . Marketers use a variety of loyalty programs to strengthen customer attitudes towards the brand ( or service provider / retailer ) in order to retain customers , minimise customer defections and strengthen loyalty bonds with existing customers . Broadly there are two types of program : reward and recognition programs . In a Reward Program , the customer accumulates points for each purchase , and the points can subsequently be exchanged for goods or services . Recognition Programs operate on a quasi-membership basis where the consumer is issued with a card that upon presentation leads to various entitlements such as free upgrades , special privileges or access to products / services that are not normally available to non - members , and that acknowledge the loyal customer 's `` VIP '' status . For example , a hotel might recognise loyal patrons by providing a complimentary fruit bowl and bottle of champagne in the room on arrival . Whereas reward programs are motivated by the consumer 's desire for material possessions , recognition programs are motivated by the consumer 's need for esteem , recognition and status . Many commercial loyalty programs are hybrid schemes , combining elements of both reward and recognition . In addition , not all reward programs are designed to encourage loyalty . Certain reward programs are designed to encourage other types of positive customer behaviour such as the provision of referrals or providing positive word - of - mouth ( WOM ) recommendations .
