After a few days , the treasure inside the galleon , El Trinidad , is accounted for , but Hunter refuses to split the treasure between the two ships , not trusting Sanson . Soon afterward , Hunter discovers he is being pursued by the warship commanded by Bosquet , Cazalla 's second - in - command . Hunter is chased to Monkey Bay , where he narrowly evades capture with the aid of Lazue 's keen eyesight . The sun 's glare on the ocean renders the warship unable to follow . Here , Hunter waits a few days , until the crew spy an impending hurricane . Now they divide the treasure between the two ships , in case one sinks in the storm and all is lost . Using Don Diego 's genius , they arm their cannons and aim for a mere two defensive shots . Upon their departure , however , the warship has disappeared .
