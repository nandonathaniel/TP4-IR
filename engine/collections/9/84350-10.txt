While Anglo - Norman or Latin was preferred for high culture , English literature by no means died out , and a number of important works illustrate the development of the language . Around the turn of the 13th century , Layamon wrote his Brut , based on Wace 's 12th century Anglo - Norman epic of the same name ; Layamon 's language is recognisably Middle English , though his prosody shows a strong Anglo - Saxon influence remaining . Other transitional works were preserved as popular entertainment , including a variety of romances and lyrics . With time , the English language regained prestige , and in 1362 it replaced French and Latin in Parliament and courts of law .
