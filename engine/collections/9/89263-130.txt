Six Flags New Orleans New Orleans 2000 2005 Originally opened as Jazzland , this park was bought in 2002 and re-branded as Six Flags New Orleans in 2003 . It was closed after severe damage from Hurricane Katrina in 2005 . The city of New Orleans sued Six Flags in 2009 for not making progress to re-open and for not making required lease payments ; ultimately , the site was turned over to the city along with a cash payment . In 2011 , the city made plans to auction the site and all remaining rides and equipment .
