The stickiness of spiders ' webs is courtesy of droplets of glue suspended on the silk threads . This glue is multifunctional -- that is , its behavior depends on how quickly something touching it attempts to withdraw . At high velocities , they function as an elastic solid , resembling rubber ; at lower velocities , they simply act as a sticky glue . This allows them to retain a grip on attached food particles . The web is also electrically conductive which causes the silk threads to spring out to trap their quarry , as flying insects tend to gain a static charge which attracts the silk .
