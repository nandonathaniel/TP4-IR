Two Milan derby Champions League knockout ties have taken place at San Siro , in 2003 and 2005 , with A.C. Milan winning both matches . The reaction of Inter 's fans to impending defeat in the latter match ( throwing flares and other objects at Milan players and forcing the match to be abandoned ) earned the club a large fine and a four - game ban on spectators attending European fixtures there the following season .
