In New York , baseball is still regarded as the most popular sport , despite being overtaken by football in terms of perceived popularity ( but not attendance ) throughout the country , as based on TV ratings and consistent fan following for the entire season . New York is home to two Major League Baseball franchises . The New York Yankees of the American League have played in New York since 1903 . Known for iconic ballplayers such as Babe Ruth , Lou Gehrig , Joe DiMaggio , Mickey Mantle , Yogi Berra and countless others , they play in Yankee Stadium in the Bronx and have won the World Series twenty - seven times . The New York Mets have represented New York in the National League since 1962 . The Mets play in Citi Field in Flushing , Queens and have won five NL pennants and two World Series , thus making them one of the most decorated expansion teams in Major League Baseball . The `` Subway Series '' is the name used for all regular season and World Series meetings between the two teams . Before interleague play was introduced in 1997 , the only instance these two teams could have played each other would have been in the World Series . The Mets and Yankees played for the World Series in 2000 , with the Yankees winning the series 4 -- 1 .
