The occipital lobe is the visual processing center of the mammalian brain containing most of the anatomical region of the visual cortex . The primary visual cortex is Brodmann area 17 , commonly called V1 ( visual one ) . Human V1 is located on the medial side of the occipital lobe within the calcarine sulcus ; the full extent of V1 often continues onto the posterior pole of the occipital lobe . V1 is often also called striate cortex because it can be identified by a large stripe of myelin , the Stria of Gennari . Visually driven regions outside V1 are called extrastriate cortex . There are many extrastriate regions , and these are specialized for different visual tasks , such as visuospatial processing , color differentiation , and motion perception .
