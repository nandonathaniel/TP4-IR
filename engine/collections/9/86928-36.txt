The final home game for Matt Doherty , Michael Jordan , and Sam Perkins , was a memorable one for Tar Heels fans . North Carolina looked to be finished when Duke 's Mark Alarie converted a three - point play with 20 second to go in regulation and the Tar Heels missed a jumper that would have tied the game . However , after the Blue Devils missed the front end of a one - and - one , Matt Doherty took the inbounds pass the length of the court and hit a 15 - footer with one second remaining to force overtime . The teams traded baskets during the first overtime and headed for the second extra session tied at 79 . Michael Jordan opened the second overtime with an ally oop and a free throw , but Johnny Dawkins cut the North Carolina lead to 82 -- 81 with a short jumper . Duke would get only one more basket as Jordan and Sam Perkins carried the Tar Heels to the 96 -- 83 final , and North Carolina became the first ACC team in 10 years to go undefeated in conference play ( 14 -- 0 ) . Alarie led all scorers with 28 points , while Jordan topped Carolina with 25 .
