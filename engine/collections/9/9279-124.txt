By the end of 1941 , the Soviet military had suffered 4.3 million casualties and the Germans had captured 3.0 million Soviet prisoners , 2.0 million of whom died in German captivity by February 1942 . German forces had advanced c. 1,700 kilometres , and maintained a linearly - measured front of 3,000 kilometres . The Red Army put up fierce resistance during the war 's early stages . Even so , according to Glantz , they were plagued by an ineffective defence doctrine against well - trained and experienced German forces , despite possessing some modern Soviet equipment , such as the KV - 1 and T - 34 tanks .
