Shortly before 312 BC , the Plebeian Council enacted the Plebiscitum Ovinium . During the early republic , only consuls could appoint new senators . This initiative , however , transferred this power to the censors . It also required the censor to appoint any newly elected magistrate to the senate . By this point , plebeians were already holding a significant number of magisterial offices . Thus , the number of plebeian senators probably increased quickly . However , it remained difficult for a plebeian to enter the senate if he was not from a well - known political family , as a new patrician - like plebeian aristocracy emerged . The old nobility existed through the force of law , because only patricians were allowed to stand for high office . The new nobility existed due to the organization of society . As such , only a revolution could overthrow this new structure .
