The original title of the poem was `` The Way of the Soul '' , and this might give an idea of how the poem is an account of all Tennyson 's thoughts and emotions as he grieves over the death of a close friend . He views the cruelty of nature and mortality in light of materialist science and faith . Owing to its length and its arguable breadth of focus , the poem might not be thought an elegy or a dirge in the strictest formal sense .
