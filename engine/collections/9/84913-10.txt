The earliest documented minigolf competitions were played in the United States . The first National Tom Thumb Open minigolf tournament was arranged in 1930 , with a total cash purse $10,000 ( the top prize being $2,000 ) . Qualification play - offs were played in all of the 48 states , and the final competition on Lookout Mountain , Chattanooga , Tennessee attracted over 200 players representing thirty states . After the Depression ten years later , minigolf died out as a competition sport in America , and has begun to recover only during the most recent decades . The American minigolf sport boom of the 1930s inspired many European countries , and the sport of minigolf lived on in Europe even after the American game fell into Depression .
