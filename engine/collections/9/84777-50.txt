After Lemaire retired from coaching , the Devils announced that the team 's all - time leading scorer , John MacLean , would become their new head coach . During the off - season , the Devils signed Kovalchuk to a 15 - year , $100 million contract , keeping him in New Jersey until the conclusion of the 2024 -- 25 season ; the move came after the NHL had rejected a 17 - year contract for allegedly circumventing the NHL Collective Bargaining Agreement ( CBA ) . The League still penalized the Devils for trying to circumvent the NHL salary cap with a money fine , a third - round draft pick in 2011 and one future first - round pick within the next four seasons . MacLean led the team to a record of 9 -- 22 -- 2 , and after sitting in last place in the NHL on December 23 , he was removed in favor of Lemaire , coming out of retirement for his third stint as head coach of the Devils and second in less than two seasons . Just a few days later , struggling captain Jamie Langenbrunner was traded back to Dallas after nine seasons with New Jersey . With the injured Parise missing most of the regular season , the team struggled offensively , finishing last in goals scored . Despite this , the Devils managed a mid-season turnaround , winning 22 out of the next 25 games . However , the Devils still failed to qualify for the playoffs for the first time since 1996 , ending their 13 - year streak .
