July and August were bad months on the frontiers . Within three weeks Mainz , the symbol of previous successes , capitulated to the Prussians , and the Austrians captured the fortresses of Cond√© and Valenciennes and invaded northern France . Spanish troops crossed the Pyrenees and began advancing on Perpignan . The Piedmontese took advantage of the diversion of republican forces at Lyons in order to invade France from the East . In Corsica , Paoli 's revolt expelled the French from the island with British support . British troops opened the siege of Dunkirk in August and in October the Allies invaded Alsace . The military situation had become desperate .
