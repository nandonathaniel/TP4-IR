In accordance with Church of Christ doctrine and practice , only males may serve as deacons ( deaconesses are not recognized ) , and must meet Biblical qualifications ( generally I Timothy 3 : 8 - 13 is the Biblical text used to determine if a male is qualified to serve as deacon ) . A deacon may also be qualified to serve as an elder ( and , in fact , may move into that role after a period of time if his service as deacon is considered acceptable ) .
