The Hollywood Reporter also wrote that Game of Thrones made a `` strong case for being one of TV 's best series '' . Impressed that the series continued to improve in quality as it breathed life into its vast web of interconnected storylines , the reviewer considered that , unlike other genre shows , Game of Thrones had gravitas such that it should not be considered dramatically inferior to shows like Mad Men or Breaking Bad . HitFix 's Alan Sepinwall gave the new , `` bigger and better '' season an `` A '' , praising its increased confidence and smoothness despite its even greater use of `` sexposition '' . New to the series , the Chicago Sun - Times 's reviewer found the season premiere `` engrossing '' and praised the `` top - notch '' acting , writing , sets and storytelling . The New York Times was the only major publication to publish a mixed review . It criticized the lack of complexity in the characters apart from Dinklage 's , the confusing multitude of characters and the meandering plot .
