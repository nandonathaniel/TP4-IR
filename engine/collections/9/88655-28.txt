Clinical laboratories formerly measured HDL cholesterol by separating other lipoprotein fractions using either ultracentrifugation or chemical precipitation with divalent ions such as Mg , then coupling the products of a cholesterol oxidase reaction to an indicator reaction . The reference method still uses a combination of these techniques . Most laboratories now use automated homogeneous analytical methods in which lipoproteins containing apo B are blocked using antibodies to apo B , then a colorimetric enzyme reaction measures cholesterol in the non-blocked HDL particles . HPLC can also be used . Subfractions ( HDL - 2C , HDL - 3C ) can be measured , but clinical significance of these subfractions has not been determined . The measurement of apo - A reactive capacity can be used to measure HDL cholesterol but is thought to be less accurate .
