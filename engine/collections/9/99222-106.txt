Extinction as a result of climate change has been confirmed by fossil studies . Particularly , the extinction of amphibians during the Carboniferous Rainforest Collapse , 305 million years ago . A 2003 review across 14 biodiversity research centers predicted that , because of climate change , 15 -- 37 % of land species would be `` committed to extinction '' by 2050 . The ecologically rich areas that would potentially suffer the heaviest losses include the Cape Floristic Region , and the Caribbean Basin . These areas might see a doubling of present carbon dioxide levels and rising temperatures that could eliminate 56,000 plant and 3,700 animal species .
