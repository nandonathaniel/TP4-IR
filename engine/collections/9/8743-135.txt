When interest in the Declaration was revived , the sections that were most important in 1776 were no longer relevant : the announcement of the independence of the United States and the grievances against King George . But the second paragraph was applicable long after the war had ended , with its talk of self - evident truths and unalienable rights . The Constitution and the Bill of Rights lacked sweeping statements about rights and equality , and advocates of groups with grievances turned to the Declaration for support . Starting in the 1820s , variations of the Declaration were issued to proclaim the rights of workers , farmers , women , and others . In 1848 , for example , the Seneca Falls Convention of women 's rights advocates declared that `` all men and women are created equal '' .
