Tommy Franks , who commanded the invasion of Iraq , has since admitted that the bombing was designed to `` degrade '' Iraqi air defences in the same way as the air attacks that began the 1991 Gulf War . These `` spikes of activity '' were , in the words of then British Defence Secretary , Geoff Hoon , designed to ' put pressure on the Iraqi regime ' or , as The Times reported , to `` provoke Saddam Hussein into giving the allies an excuse for war '' . In this respect , as provocations designed to start a war , leaked British Foreign Office legal advice concluded that such attacks were illegal under international law .
