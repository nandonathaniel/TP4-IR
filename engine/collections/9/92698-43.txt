For atoms with low atomic numbers , a nucleus that has more neutrons than protons tends to drop to a lower energy state through radioactive decay so that the neutron -- proton ratio is closer to one . However , as the atomic number increases , a higher proportion of neutrons is required to offset the mutual repulsion of the protons . Thus , there are no stable nuclei with equal proton and neutron numbers above atomic number Z = 20 ( calcium ) and as Z increases , the neutron -- proton ratio of stable isotopes increases . The stable isotope with the highest proton -- neutron ratio is lead - 208 ( about 1.5 ) .
