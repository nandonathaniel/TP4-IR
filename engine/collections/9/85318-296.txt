The club played each of the other seven clubs once in the home - and - away series of the inaugural AFL Women 's fixture over February and March . The main highlight of the fixture was the Round 1 match against Collingwood , which saw the two traditional men 's rivals play the first match in the new competition 's history . The match , for which admission was free , drew a lockout crowd of 24,568 at Ikon Park , after having originally been scheduled for Collingwood 's 5,000 - capacity Olympic Park training oval then being transferred due to the expected crowd . The team 's Round 4 , 5 and 6 matches against Melbourne , Fremantle and the Western Bulldogs served as curtain - raisers to the senior team 's pre-season practice matches against the same clubs .
