In Hong Kong any person aged 18 or above can apply for a Learner 's Driving License for private cars , light goods vehicle and motorcycles . For other types of vehicle the age required is 21 and the applicant must have a valid private car or light goods vehicle driving license for 3 years . Unlike other jurisdictions , a learner must be supervised by an approved driving instructor instead of an ordinary fully licensed driver , or attending an approved driving school to learn to drive ( except motorcycles , which learners can drive on their own , but motorcycle learners must pass a motorcycle course from an approved driving school before they can learn to drive on road ) . L - plate is also required when the learner is practicing .
