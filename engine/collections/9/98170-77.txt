In Portuguese as a rule and occasionally in Spanish and other languages , the entirety of the Antilles is often included in the definition of Central America ( the Portuguese Wikipedia article for the Antilles offers , in fact , Am√©rica Central Insular as an alternative name ) , which is its own region to be distinguished from North America and South America alike . Indeed , the Dominican Republic is a full member of the Central American Integration System .
