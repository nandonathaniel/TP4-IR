However a change in the IMSA rules would lead to the demise of the Camel Lights , and so Acura moved to touring car racing , joining Realtime Racing in the SCCA World Challenge with the NSX in 1996 , winning the final two races of the season . In 1997 , Acura added Acura Integras to the lower classes , and were successful in taking the championship in both of these classes . Realtime took the touring championship with the Integra again in 1998 , and came within a few points of winning it again in 1999 only to lose it in the final race , then coming back to retake the title in 2000 .
