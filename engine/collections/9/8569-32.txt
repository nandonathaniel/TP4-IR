The Soviet Union sought to dominate the internal affairs of countries that bordered it . During the war , Stalin had created special training centers for communists from different countries so that they could set up secret police forces loyal to Moscow as soon as the Red Army took control . Soviet agents took control of the media , especially radio ; they quickly harassed and then banned all independent civic institutions , from youth groups to schools , churches and rival political parties . Stalin also sought continued peace with Britain and the United States , hoping to focus on internal reconstruction and economic growth .
