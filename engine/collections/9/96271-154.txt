The Wave ( streetcar ) , a new 2.7 - mile ( 4.3 km ) electric streetcar system costing $125 million , is being planned for the downtown . Most of the construction funding will come from federal ( $62.5 million ) , state ( $37 million ) and city taxpayers ( $10.5 million ) , with approximately $15 million from assessments on properties located within the Downtown Development Authority . Broward County ( BCT ) has committed to operating the system for the first 10 years at an expected annual cost of $2 million , and has guaranteed funding to cover any shortfall in ridership revenues . The construction cost of $50 million per mile is considerably higher than other recently built streetcar projects , in part due to the challenges of building an electric transit system over the 3rd Avenue drawbridge .
