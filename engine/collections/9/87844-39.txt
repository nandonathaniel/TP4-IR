The Rock Springs massacre occurred in 1885 . In 1885 , many enraged white miners in Sweetwater County , Wyoming felt threatened by the Chinese and blamed them for their unemployment . As a result of the job competition , white miners expressed their frustration in physical violence where they robbed , shot , and stabbed at Chinese in Chinatown . The Chinese quickly tried to flee but in doing so , many ended up burned alive in their homes , starved to death in hidden refuge , or exposed to animal predators of the mountains . Some were successfully rescued by the passing train , but by the end of the event at least twenty - eight lives had been lost .
