The 1884 Republican National Convention was held in Chicago , Illinois , on June 3 -- 6 , with former Speaker of the House James G. Blaine from Maine , President Arthur , and Senator George F. Edmunds from Vermont as the frontrunners . Though he was still popular , Arthur did not make a serious bid for a full - term nomination , knowing that his increasing health problems meant he would probably not survive a second term ( he ultimately died in November 1886 ) . Blaine led on the first ballot , with Arthur second , and Edmunds third . This order did not change on successive ballots as Blaine increased his lead , and he won a majority on the fourth ballot . After nominating Blaine , the convention chose Senator John A. Logan from Illinois as the vice-presidential nominee . Blaine remains the only Presidential nominee ever to come from Maine .
