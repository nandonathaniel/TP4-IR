Subsequently , there was another major drop for the Dow on October 13 , 1989 -- the Mini-Crash of 1989 . The crash was apparently caused by a reaction to a news story of a $6.75 billion leveraged buyout deal for UAL Corporation , the parent company of United Airlines , which broke down . When the UAL deal fell through , it helped trigger the collapse of the junk bond market causing the Dow to fall 190.58 points , or 6.91 percent .
