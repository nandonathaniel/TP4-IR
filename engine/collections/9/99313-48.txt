Terming Romeo and Juliet as `` the mother of all love stories '' , Bhansali wanted to make a different story with it , one that was not yet explored in cinematic adaptations . While changing many aspects of the film , Bhansali kept the theme of `` misunderstanding between star - crossed lovers '' , while transposing them to another level . The idea of a feud between two families that destroys everything really appealed to him . Acocording to Bhansali , `` the whole execution of Shakespeare is more flirtatious and voluptuous '' and he felt his film was the best interpretation of Romeo and Juliet . When asked about the extensive violence and guns in the film , he said that violence is `` an integral part '' of Romeo and Juliet , also stating how important it was for a filmmaker `` to get out of his comfort zone '' .
