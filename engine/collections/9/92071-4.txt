Married Man 's allowance was the allowance for a legally married couple . The allowance was given at the man 's highest rate of tax . During the early 1990s the then Chancellor Norman Lamont overhauled the allowance and introduced the 10 % allowance , which meant that all men had the same amount of money in their pocket , irrespective of highest tax rate . The allowance was scrapped from April 2000 , first being announced in Gordon Brown 's 1999 budget , with the exception of people married or in civil partnerships where one spouse was born before 6 April 1935 .
