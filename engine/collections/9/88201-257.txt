An irreversible antagonist binds so strongly to the receptor as to render the receptor unavailable for binding to the agonist . Irreversible antagonists may even form covalent chemical bonds with the receptor . In either case , if the concentration of the irreversible antagonist is high enough , the number of unbound receptors remaining for agonist binding may be so low that even high concentrations of the agonist do not produce the maximum biological response .
