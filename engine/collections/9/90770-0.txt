A couple of homologous chromosomes , or homologs , are a set of one maternal and one paternal chromosome that pair up with each other inside a cell during meiosis . Homologs have the same genes in the same loci where they provide points along each chromosome which enable a pair of chromosomes to align correctly with each other before separating during meiosis . This is the basis for Mendelian inheritance which characterizes inheritance patterns of genetic material from an organism to its offspring parent developmental cell at the given time and area .
