The series of 1999 and 2002 are considered drawn series , as both New South Wales and Queensland won a single game of each 3 match series , with the final game concluding in a draw . At that time there was no overtime rule to break the deadlock , and by the same set of rules , Queensland retained the shield as they were the previous holders , but did not win the series . Due to controversy around the second drawn series , and the rule awarding the series champions to Queensland , the rules were subsequently changed to rule out drawn matches and series . Equal points at the close of full - time are now resolved with the golden point method .
