The early years saw a variety of village activities , not a broad movement with a united purpose . Martial folk religious societies such as the Baguadao ( Eight Trigrams ) prepared the way for the Boxers . Like the Red Boxing school or the Plum Flower Boxers , the Boxers of Shandong were more concerned with traditional social and moral values , such as filial piety , than with foreign influences . One leader , Zhu Hongdeng ( Red Lantern Zhu ) , started as a wandering healer , specializing in skin ulcers , and gained wide respect by refusing payment for his treatments . Zhu claimed descent from Ming dynasty emperors , since his surname was the surname of the Ming imperial family . He announced that his goal was to `` Revive the Qing and destroy the foreigners '' ( `` 扶 清 灭 洋 fu Qing mie yang '' ) .
