The most notable player for the Rams during that period was running back Eric Dickerson , who was drafted in 1983 out of SMU and won Rookie of the Year . In 1984 , Dickerson rushed for 2,105 yards , setting a new NFL record . Dickerson would end his five hugely successful years for the Rams in 1987 by being traded to the Indianapolis Colts for a number of players and draft picks after a bitter contract dispute , shortly after the players ' strike that year ended . Dickerson was the Rams ' career rushing leader until 2010 , with 7,245 yards . Despite this trade , the Rams remained contenders due to the arrival of the innovative offensive leadership of Ernie Zampese . Zampese brought the intricate timing routes he had used in making the San Diego Chargers a state - of - the - art offense . Under Zampese , the Rams rose steadily from 28th rated offense in 1986 to 3rd in 1990 . The late 1980s Rams featured a gifted young QB in Jim Everett , a solid rushing attack and a fleet of talented WRs led by Henry Ellard .
