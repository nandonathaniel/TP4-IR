Cu has a half - life of 12.701 ± 0.002 hours and decays by 17.86 ( ± 0.14 ) % by positron emission to Ni , 39.0 ( ± 0.3 ) % by beta decay to Zn , 43.075 ( ± 0.500 ) % by electron capture to Ni , and 0.475 ( ± 0.010 ) % gamma radiation / internal conversion . These emissions are 0.5787 ( ± 0.0009 ) and 0.6531 ( ± 0.0002 ) MeV for beta minus and positron respectively and 1.34577 ( ± 0.00016 ) MeV for gamma .
