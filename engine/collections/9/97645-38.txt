Universal lacked a major event movie for the following summer and quickly rushed Furious 7 into production for a release in Summer 2014 . Justin Lin decided not to return to direct the seventh film as he was still performing post-production on Fast & Furious 6 and James Wan took over directorial duties . Like Fast 5 , Furious 7 is seen as a transitional movie which shifts the franchise from a heist to a spy action movie genre . The untimely death of Paul Walker in a car accident in November 2013 while half way filming Furious 7 forced Universal to major re-shoots , script changes , hiring Weta Digital to use CGI to create Paul 's likeness and ultimately delayed releasing the movie from July 2014 to April 2015 . Furious 7 was the most successful film in the franchise and producers decided to retire the Paul Walker character instead of killing him off . However , the toll of directing the movie with additional re-shoots forced Director James Wan not to return to the franchise . F. Gary Gray stepped in to helm the 8th movie , The Fate of the Furious , which was released in April 2017 , starting a new trilogy of movies which will end the entire franchise . Originally the 9th movie was supposed to be released April 2019 and followed by the 10th movie in April 2021 . However , Universal proceeded to start a spin - off movie with Dwayne Johnson and Jason Statham called Hobbs and Shaw , which now occupies the 2019 release date . This caused tensions between Dwayne Johnson , Vin Diesel and Tyrese as it delayed the release of Fast and Furious 9 . Universal later announced that Fast and Furious 9 and 10 will be released back to back on April 2020 and April 2021 to end the franchise with Justin Lin returning to direct both movies .
