In April 1909 Charles David Herrold , an electronics instructor in San Jose , California constructed a broadcasting station . It used spark gap technology , but modulated the carrier frequency with the human voice , and later music . The station `` San Jose Calling '' ( there were no call letters ) , continued to eventually become today 's KCBS in San Francisco . Herrold , the son of a Santa Clara Valley farmer , coined the terms `` narrowcasting '' and `` broadcasting '' , respectively to identify transmissions destined for a single receiver such as that on board a ship , and those transmissions destined for a general audience . ( The term `` broadcasting '' had been used in farming to define the tossing of seed in all directions . ) Charles Herrold did not claim to be the first to transmit the human voice , but he claimed to be the first to conduct `` broadcasting '' . To help the radio signal to spread in all directions , he designed some omnidirectional antennas , which he mounted on the rooftops of various buildings in San Jose . Herrold also claims to be the first broadcaster to accept advertising ( he exchanged publicity for a local record store for records to play on his station ) , though this dubious honour usually is foisted on WEAF ( 1922 ) .
