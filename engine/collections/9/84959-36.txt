Fort Malden in Amherstburg , Ontario , was deemed the `` chief place of entry '' for slaves seeking to enter Canada . The abolitionist Levi Coffin supported this assessment , describing Fort Malden as `` the great landing place , the principle terminus of the underground railroad of the west . '' After 1850 , approximately thirty fugitive slaves a day were crossing over to Fort Malden by steamboat . The Sultana was one of such ships and made `` frequent round trips '' between Great Lakes ports . Its captain , C.W. Appleby , a celebrated mariner , facilitated the conveyance of several fugitive slaves from various Lake Erie ports to Fort Malden .
