This World Series win had significance for McCarver and Harry Kalas . Both had been Phillies broadcasters in 1980 , but neither had gotten to call that year 's World Series . McCarver was a backup commentator for Game of the Week on NBC , but he was not part of the network 's Series announcing team . For Kalas , MLB radio - broadcasting regulations forbade local stations from producing live coverage of World Series games , instead forcing them to air the national CBS Radio feed of the games . Philadelphia fans were so outraged about this afterward that they started a letter - writing campaign to the Commissioner 's Office , demanding a change to the rule . The following year , MLB amended its broadcasting contracts to allow World Series teams ' flagship radio stations to air the games with local announcers , due at least in part to this outcry from Philadelphia fans . In 2008 , both called the Phillies ' World Series win .
