Indirect rule is a system of government used by the British and French to control parts of their colonial empires , particularly in Africa and Asia , through pre-existing local power structures . These dependencies were often called `` protectorates '' or `` trucial states '' . By this system , the day - to - day government and administration of areas both small and large was left in the hands of traditional rulers , who gained prestige and the stability and protection afforded by the Pax Britannica , at the cost of losing control of their external affairs , and often of taxation , communications , and other matters , usually with a small number of European `` advisors '' effectively overseeing the government of large numbers of people spread over extensive areas .
