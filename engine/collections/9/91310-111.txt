The Death Star assault scene was modeled after the World War II film The Dam Busters ( 1955 ) , in which Royal Air Force Lancaster bombers fly along heavily defended reservoirs and aim bouncing bombs at dams , in order to cripple the heavy industry of Germany 's Ruhr region . Some of the dialogue in The Dam Busters is repeated in the Star Wars climax ; Gilbert Taylor also filmed the special effects sequences in The Dam Busters . In addition , the sequence was partially inspired by the climax of the film 633 Squadron ( 1964 ) , directed by Walter Grauman , in which RAF de Havilland Mosquitos attack a German heavy water plant by flying down a narrow fjord to drop special bombs at a precise point , while avoiding anti-aircraft guns and German fighters . Clips from both films were included in Lucas 's temporary dogfight footage version of the sequence .
