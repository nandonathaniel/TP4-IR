A very important employer and a major source of revenue for the city 's inhabitants is the import of Japanese cars . Besides salesmen , the industry employs repairmen , fitters , import clerks as well as shipping and railway companies . The Vladivostok dealers sell 250,000 cars a year , with 200,000 going to other parts of Russia . Every third worker in the Primorsky Krai has some relation to the automobile import business . In recent years , the Russian government has made attempts to improve the country 's own car industry . This has included raising tariffs for imported cars , which has put the car import business in Vladivostok in difficulties . To compensate , Prime Minister Vladimir Putin ordered the car manufacturing company Sollers to move one of its factories from Moscow to Vladivostok . The move was completed in 2009 , and the factory now employs about 700 locals . It is planned to produce 13,200 cars in Vladivostok in 2010 .
