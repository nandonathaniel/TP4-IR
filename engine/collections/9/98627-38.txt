The first six years of the IB Diploma Programme , with a limited number of students , are referred to as the `` experimental period '' . Each school was to be inspected by ISES or IBO and had to be approved by their government . The experimental period ended in 1975 , and in that year , the International Baccalaureate North America ( IBNA ) was established as a separate entity , allowing the funding for implementation of the IBDP to remain in the country rather than being sent to Geneva . The first official guide to the programme containing its syllabus and official assessment information was published in 1970 and included the theory of knowledge course . The extended essay was introduced in 1978 , but creativity , action , service ( CAS ) , although mentioned in guides beforehand , was not specifically identified in the guide until 1989 .
