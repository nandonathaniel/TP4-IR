Between 1948 and 1950 in American - occupied Germany and the Federal Republic of Germany , Bavaria returned to the jury trial as it had existed before the emergency decrees , but they were again abolished by the 1950 Unification Act ( Vereinheitlichungsgesetz ) for the Federal Republic . In 1979 , the United States tried the East German LOT Flight 165 hijacking suspects in the United States Court for Berlin in West Berlin , which declared the defendants had the right to a jury trial under the United States Constitution , and hence were tried by a West German jury .
