President Woodrow Wilson initially planned to give command of the AEF to Gen. Frederick Funston , but after Funston 's sudden death , Wilson appointed Major General John J. Pershing in May 1917 , and Pershing remained in command for the entire war . Pershing insisted that American soldiers be well - trained before going to Europe . As a result , few troops arrived before January 1918 . In addition , Pershing insisted that the American force would not be used merely to fill gaps in the French and British armies , and he resisted European efforts to have U.S. troops deployed as individual replacements in decimated Allied units . This approach was not always well received by the western Allied leaders who distrusted the potential of an army lacking experience in large - scale warfare . In addition , the British Empire tried to bargain with its spare shipping to make the United States put its soldiers into British ranks .
