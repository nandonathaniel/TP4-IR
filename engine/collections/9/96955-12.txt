In the early 20th century , George Gershwin was greatly influenced by African American music . He created a convincing synthesis of music from several traditions . Similarly inclined was Leonard Bernstein , who at times mixed non-tonal music with Jazz in his classical compositions . Leroy Anderson , Ferde Grofe and Morton Gould also composed pieces in the `` symphonic jazz '' vein .
