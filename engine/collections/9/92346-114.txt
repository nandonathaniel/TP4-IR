Through 1984 and 1985 , the Salvadoran Armed Forces enacted a series of `` civic - action '' programs in Chalatenango province . This consisted of the establishment of `` citizen defense committees '' to guard plantations and businesses against attacks by insurgents and the establishment of a number of free - fire zones . These measures were implemented under former Cabanas commander , Lieutenant Colonel Sigifredo Ochoa Perez , who had previously been exiled to the US Army War College for mutiny . By January 1985 Ochoa 's forces had established 12 free - fire zones in Chalatenango in which any inhabitants unidentified by the army were deemed to be insurgents . Ochoa stated in an interview that areas within the free fire zone were susceptible to indiscriminate bombings by the Salvadoran Air Force . Ochoa 's forces were implicated in a massacre of about 40 civilians in an Army sweep through one of the free fire zones in August 1985 . Ochoa refused to permit the Red Cross to enter these areas to deliver humanitarian aid to the victims . Ochoa 's forces reportedly uprooted some 1,400 civilian rebel supporters with mortar fire between September and November 1984 .
