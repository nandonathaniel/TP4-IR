Cynthia Sanders , played by Tania Raymonde ( 4 episodes ) , is one of Malcolm 's classmates . She has a very extensive vocabulary , but has a difficult time making friends . Depicted as relatively cheerful , Cynthia becomes one of Malcolm 's earliest crushes on the show , although a relationship never develops . Cynthia is last seen claiming to never have sex with Malcolm again ( which never happened in the first place ) to snap him out of a recent funk and keep him from pulling a prank meant to get him sent away like Francis .
