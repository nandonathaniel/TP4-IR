Funimation licensed Dragon Ball Kai for an English - language release in North America , under the title Dragon Ball Z Kai . The series was broadcast on Nicktoons from May 24 , 2010 to January 1 , 2012 . In addition to Nicktoons , the series also began airing on the 4Kids - owned Saturday morning programming block Toonzai on The CW in August 2010 , then on its successor , the Saban - owned Vortexx , beginning in August 2012 until the block ended on September 2014 . Both the Nicktoons and Toonzai / Vortexx airings were edited for content , though the Toonzai / Vortexx version was censored even more so than Nicktoons ( perhaps most notoriously , Mr. Popo was tinted blue ) , most likely due to The CW being a broadcast network , although it 's possible , albeit unlikely , that 4Kids was at least partially involved , considering their notoriety for heavy censorship of this sort . Kai began airing uncut on Adult Swim 's Toonami block in November 2014 , and re-runs of the previous week 's episodes aired at the beginning of Adult Swim proper from February 2015 to June 2016 . CSC Media Group acquired the broadcast rights to Dragon Ball Z Kai in the United Kingdom and began airing it on Kix ! in early 2013 .
