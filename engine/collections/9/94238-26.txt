However , extensive work by Carla Hudson - Kam and Elissa Newport suggests that creole languages may not support a universal grammar at all . In a series of experiments , Hudson - Kam and Newport looked at how children and adults learn artificial grammars . They found that children tend to ignore minor variations in the input when those variations are infrequent , and reproduce only the most frequent forms . In doing so , they tend to standardize the language that they hear around them . Hudson - Kam and Newport hypothesize that in a pidgin - development situation ( and in the real - life situation of a deaf child whose parents are or were disfluent signers ) , children systematize the language they hear , based on the probability and frequency of forms , and not that which has been suggested on the basis of a universal grammar . Further , it seems to follow that creoles would share features with the languages from which they are derived , and thus look similar in terms of grammar .
