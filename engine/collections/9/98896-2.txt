To further this aim , invitations to defect , which also acted as safe conduct passes , were printed on clear plastic waterproof bags used to carry ammunition for the US soldiers ' M16 assault rifle . Each bag held one magazine and was sealed to prevent moisture from the jungle 's humid climate from damaging the contents . When the magazine was needed during a firefight with the enemy , the bag would be torn open and discarded , in the hope that it would later be discovered by enemy troops who would read the text and consider defection .
