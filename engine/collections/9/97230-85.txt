On 22 October 2015 a letter was published in The Guardian signed by Rowling ( along with over 150 other figures from arts and politics ) opposing the cultural boycott of Israel , and announcing the creation of a network for dialogue , called Culture for Coexistence . Rowling later explained her position in more detail , saying that although she opposed most of Benjamin Netanyahu 's actions she did not think the cultural boycott would bring about the removal of Israel 's leader or help improve the situation in Israel and Palestine .
