Czechoslovakia celebrated only Women 's Day until the Velvet Revolution in 1989 . After the country split in 1993 , Slovakia started celebrating both Women 's Day and Mother 's Day . The politicization of Women 's Day has affected the official status of Mother 's Day . Center - right parties want Mother 's Day to replace Women 's Day , and social - democrats want to make Women 's Day an official holiday . Currently , both days are festive , but they are not `` state holidays '' . In the Slovak Republic , Mother 's Day is celebrated every second Sunday in May .
