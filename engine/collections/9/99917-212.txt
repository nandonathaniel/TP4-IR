In 328 BC , Alexander The Great of Macedonia and now the king of Persia , had conquered much of the former Satraps of the Achaemenid Empire up to Bactria . The remaining satraps lay in the Indus Valley , but Alexander ruled off invading the Indus until his forces were in complete control of the newly acquired satraps . In 327 BC , Alexander married Roxana ( a princess of the former Bactria satrapy ) to cement his relations with his new territories . Now firmly under Macedonian rule , Alexander was free to turn his attention to the Indus Valley . The rationale for the Indus campaign is usually said to be Alexander 's desire to conquer the entire known world , which the Greeks thought ended around the vicinity of the River Indus .
