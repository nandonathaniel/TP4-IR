In 1982 , the band released the album Hot Space , a departure from their trademark seventies sound , this time being a mixture of rock , pop rock , dance , funk , and R&B . Most of the album was recorded in Munich during the most turbulent period in the band 's history , and Taylor and May lamented the new sound , with both being very critical of the influence Mercury 's personal manager Paul Prenter had on the singer . May was also scathing of Prenter , who was Mercury 's manager from the early 1980s to 1984 , for being dismissive of the importance of radio stations , such as the US networks , and their vital connection between the artist and the community , and for denying them access to Mercury . Q magazine would list Hot Space as one of the top fifteen albums where great rock acts lost the plot . On 14 and 15 September 1982 , the band performed their last two gigs in the US with Mercury on lead vocals , those concerts were held at The Forum in Inglewood , California . The band stopped touring North America after their Hot Space Tour , as their success there had waned , although they would perform on American television for the only time during the eighth - season premiere of Saturday Night Live on 25 September of the same year ; it became the final public performance of the band in North America before the death of their frontman . Queen left Elektra Records , their label in the US , Canada , Japan , Australia , and New Zealand , and signed onto EMI / Capitol Records .
