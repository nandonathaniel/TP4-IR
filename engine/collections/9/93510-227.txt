In 1599 , Abbas sent his first diplomatic mission to Europe . The group crossed the Caspian Sea and spent the winter in Moscow before proceeding through Norway and Germany ( where it was received by Emperor Rudolf II ) to Rome , where Pope Clement VIII gave the travellers a long audience . They finally arrived at the court of Philip III of Spain in 1602 . Although the expedition never managed to return to Iran , being shipwrecked on the journey around Africa , it marked an important new step in contacts between Iran and Europe . The Europeans began to be fascinated by the Iranians and their culture -- Shakespeare 's Twelfth Night ( 1601 -- 02 ) , for example , makes two references ( at II. 5 and III. 4 ) to ' the Sophy ' , then the English term for the Shahs of Iran . Henceforward , the number of diplomatic missions to and fro greatly increased .
