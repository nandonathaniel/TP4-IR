During the reign of Muhammad Shah ( reigned 1719 -- 1748 ) , the empire began to break up , and vast tracts of central India passed from Mughal to Maratha hands . The far - off Indian campaign of Nadir Shah , who had priorly reestablished Iranian suzerainty over most of West Asia , the Caucasus , and Central Asia , culminated with the Sack of Delhi and shattered the remnants of Mughal power and prestige . Many of the empire 's elites now sought to control their own affairs , and broke away to form independent kingdoms . But , according to Sugata Bose and Ayesha Jalal , the Mughal Emperor continued to be the highest manifestation of sovereignty . Not only the Muslim gentry , but the Maratha , Hindu , and Sikh leaders took part in ceremonial acknowledgements of the emperor as the sovereign of India .
