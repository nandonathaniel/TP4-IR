This event marked the continuation of the integration of professional sports in the United States , with professional football having led the way in 1946 , with the concomitant demise of the Negro Leagues , and is regarded as a key moment in the history of the American civil rights movement . Robinson was an exceptional player , a speedy runner who sparked the team with his intensity . He was the inaugural recipient of the Rookie of the Year award , which is now named the Jackie Robinson award in his honor . The Dodgers ' willingness to integrate , when most other teams refused to , was a key factor in their 1947 -- 1956 success . They won six pennants in those 10 years with the help of Robinson , three - time MVP Roy Campanella , Cy Young Award winner Don Newcombe , Jim Gilliam , and Joe Black . Robinson eventually became the first African - American elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1962 .
