Massive particles are a concern for astronauts outside the earth 's magnetic field who would receive solar particles from solar proton events ( SPE ) and galactic cosmic rays from cosmic sources . These high - energy charged nuclei are blocked by Earth 's magnetic field but pose a major health concern for astronauts traveling to the moon and to any distant location beyond the earth orbit . Highly charged HZE ions in particular are known to be extremely damaging , although protons make up the vast majority of galactic cosmic rays . Evidence indicates past SPE radiation levels that would have been lethal for unprotected astronauts .
