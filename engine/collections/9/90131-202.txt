Individual states may also have athletic commissions , which primarily govern individual sports such as boxing , kickboxing and mixed martial arts . Notable state athletic commissions are the Nevada Athletic Commission , California State Athletic Commission , New York State Athletic Commission and New Jersey State Athletic Control Board . Although these commissions only have jurisdiction over their own states , the Full Faith and Credit Clause of the U.S. Constitution is often interpreted as forcing all other states to recognize any state athletic commission 's rulings regarding an athlete 's fitness for participating in a sport .
