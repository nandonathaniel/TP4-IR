British long - range bomber planes such as the Short Stirling had been designed before 1939 for strategic flights and given a large armament , but their technology still suffered from numerous flaws . The smaller and shorter ranged Bristol Blenheim , the RAF 's most - used bomber , was defended by only one hydraulically operated machine - gun turret , and whilst this appeared sufficient , it was soon revealed that the turret was a pathetic defence against squadrons of German fighter planes . American bomber planes such as the B - 17 Flying Fortress had been built before the war as the only adequate long - range bombers in the world , designed to patrol the long American coastlines . Defended by as many as six machine - gun turrets providing 360 Â° cover , the B - 17s were still vulnerable without fighter protection even when used in large formations .
