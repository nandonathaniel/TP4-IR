Mr. Bennet of the Longbourn estate has five daughters , but his property is entailed , meaning that none of the girls can inherit it . His wife has no fortune , so it is imperative that at least one of the girls marry well in order to support the others upon his death . Jane Austen 's opening line , `` It is a truth universally acknowledged , that a single man in possession of a good fortune , must be in want of a wife '' , is a sentence filled with irony and playfulness . The novel revolves around the importance of marrying for love , not simply for money , despite the social pressures to make a good ( i.e. , wealthy ) match .
