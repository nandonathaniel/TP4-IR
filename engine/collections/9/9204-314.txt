On August 24 , U.S. Secretary of War John Armstrong Jr. insisted that the British were going to attack Baltimore rather than Washington , even when British army and naval units were obviously on their way to Washington . The inexperienced state militia was easily routed in the Battle of Bladensburg , opening the route to Washington . While First Lady Dolley Madison saved valuables from what is now the `` White House '' , senior officials fled to Virginia . Secretary of the Navy William Jones ordered setting fire to the Washington Navy Yard to prevent the capture of supplies . The nation 's public buildings were destroyed by the British ( and by a furious thunderstorm that ruined a great deal of property , although it did quench the flames ) . American morale was challenged , and many Federalists swung around and rallied to a patriotic defense of their homeland .
