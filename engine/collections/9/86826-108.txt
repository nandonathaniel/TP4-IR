On February 13 , 1975 , a three - alarm fire broke out on the 11th floor of the North Tower . Fire spread through the tower to the 9th and 14th floors by igniting the insulation of telephone cables in a utility shaft that ran vertically between floors . Areas at the furthest extent of the fire were extinguished almost immediately and the original fire was put out in a few hours . Most of the damage was concentrated on the 11th floor , fueled by cabinets filled with paper , alcohol - based fluid for office machines , and other office equipment . Fireproofing protected the steel and there was no structural damage to the tower . In addition to damage caused by the fire on the 9th -- 14th floors , water from the extinguishing of the fires damaged a few floors below . At that time , the World Trade Center had no fire sprinkler systems .
