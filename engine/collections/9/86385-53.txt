Nicolas Sammond argues that the film is `` an apt metaphor for the metaphysics of midcentury American child - rearing '' and that the film is `` ultimately an assimilationist fable '' . He considered it to be the central Disney film and the most strongly middle class , intended to relay the message that indulging in `` the pleasures of the working class , of vaudeville , or of pool halls and amusement parks , led to a life as a beast of burden '' . For Sammond , the purpose of Pinocchio is to help convey to children the `` middle - class virtues of deferred gratification , self - denial , thrift , and perseverance , naturalized as the experience of the most average American '' .
