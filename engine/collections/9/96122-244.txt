The compensating system was applied to horns to serve a different purpose . It was used to allow a double horn in F and B ♭ to ease playing difficulties in the high register . In contrast to the system in use in tubas and euphoniums , the default ' side ' of the horn is the longer F horn , with secondary lengths of tubing coming into play when the first , second or third valves are pressed ; pressing the thumb valve takes these secondary valve slides and the extra length of main tubing out of play to produce a shorter B ♭ horn . A later `` full double '' design has completely separate valve section tubing for the two sides , and is considered superior , although rather heavier in weight .
