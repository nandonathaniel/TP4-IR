In the TV film The Wedding Frame , when the Foutleys are driving to their soon - to - be home , they pass a cemetery park . One tombstone reads `` ATBG '' while the other reads `` RIP '' . ATBG is short for As Told by Ginger and RIP is short for `` Rest in Peace '' . This is a nod to the fact that this film is the series finale . A girl named Leandra , who had a bone marrow illness and was a Make - A-Wish patient , was a fan of the series and watched it during her treatments . Her wish was to be a character on the show , so she appeared and voiced a character named after her in a scene of the episode `` Butterflies are Free '' , where Ginger , Macie and Dodie greet her by name .
