Under two now - overturned Supreme Court decisions , Quill Corp. v. North Dakota ( 1967 ) and National Bellas Hess v. Illinois ( 1992 ) , states were not allowed to charge sales tax on sellers who did not have a physical presence or `` nexus '' in the state , such as companies doing mail order , online shopping , and home shopping by phone . Some states do attempt to charge consumers an identical per - transaction use tax instead , but compliance is relatively low due to the difficulty of enforcement . The June 2018 decision South Dakota v. Wayfair reversed this interpretation of the Commerce Clause , allowing states to collect sales tax from out - of - state merchants when the consumer is in the state .
