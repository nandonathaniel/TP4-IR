Louisa grows jealous when Spiros begins spending time helping a new Italian family , the Ferraris , that has arrived on the island . Immediate relations between the families are fractious ; nevertheless , the Durrells are roped into home - training the children , who had been dependent on their tending staff and late mother . However , the aloof behaviour of the Ferrari son , Paolo , soon draws concern , and the Durrells discover the reason behind the family 's sudden departure from their home country ; the tragic actions of the father his son was made to take as his own . Louisa and Spiros ' relationship sours through a disagreement over his devotion to her family split with another , which they later become repentant over . Larry joins the local volunteer fire department , where his efforts to modernise it go awry . Theo acts as an inadvertent third wheel when Gerry is joined by a local girl on their search for vultures . Margo 's new destiny is to gain the level of beauty bestowed upon one of the Ferrari daughters , and a suggestion to kiss the footwear of a dead saint to do so is fulfilled as a last resort - and results in the completely opposite effect .
