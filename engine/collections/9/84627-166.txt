News is the leading source of knowledge about global affairs for people around the world . According to agenda - setting theory , the general public will identify as its priorities those issues which are highlighted on the news . The agenda - setting model has been well - supported by research , which indicate that the public 's self - reported concerns respond to changes in news coverage rather than changes in the underlying issue itself . The less an issue obviously affects people 's lives , the bigger an influence media agenda - setting can have on their opinion of it . The agenda - setting power becomes even stronger in practice because of the correspondence in news topics promulgated by different media channels .
