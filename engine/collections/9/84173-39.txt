Studies suggest the 19 - mile ( 30 km ) `` exclusion zone '' surrounding the Chernobyl disaster has become a wildlife sanctuary . Animals have reclaimed the land including species such as the Przewalski 's horse , Eurasian lynx , wild boar , grey wolf , elk , red deer , moose , brown bear , turtle , voles , mice , shrews , European badger , Eurasian beaver , raccoon dog , red fox , roe deer , European bison , black stork , golden eagle , white - tailed eagle and eagle owl whose populations are all thriving . When the disaster first occurred , the health and reproductive ability of many animals and plants were negatively affected for the first six months . However , 30 years later , animals and plants have reclaimed the abandoned zone to make it their habitat . Even the site of the explosion was flourishing with wildlife in 2012 as birds nested in the wrecked nuclear plant , and plants and mushrooms lived in and on the site . A 2015 study found similar numbers of mammals in the zone compared to nearby similar nature reserves and the wildlife population was probably higher than it had been before the accident .
