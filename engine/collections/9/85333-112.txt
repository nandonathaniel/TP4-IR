On February 10 , 2017 , in the Moda Health v the US Government , Moda , one of the insurers that struggled financially because of the elimination of the risk corridor program , won a `` $214 - million judgment against the federal government '' . On appeal , judge Thomas C. Wheeler stated , `` the Government made a promise in the risk corridors program that it has yet to fulfill . Today , the court directs the Government to fulfill that promise . After all , to say to ( Moda ) , ' The joke is on you . You should n't have trusted us , ' is hardly worthy of our great government . ''
