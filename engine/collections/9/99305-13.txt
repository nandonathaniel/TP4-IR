A traditional realist position in ontology is that time and space have existence apart from the human mind . Idealists , by contrast , deny or doubt the existence of objects independent of the mind . Some anti-realists , whose ontological position is that objects outside the mind do exist , nevertheless doubt the independent existence of time and space .
