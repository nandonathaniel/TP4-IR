Lou Holtz had 17 years of head coaching experience by the time he was hired to lead the Irish . He had previously been head coach of William & Mary , North Carolina State , the NFL 's New York Jets , Arkansas , and Minnesota . Holtz began in 1986 where his predecessor left off in 1985 , finishing with an identical record of 5 wins and 6 losses . However , unlike the 1985 squad , which was generally outcoached and outplayed , Holtz 's 1986 edition was competitive in nearly every game , losing five out of those six games by a combined total of 14 points . That would be his only losing season as he posted a record of 95 -- 24 -- 2 over the next ten seasons adding up to a 100 -- 30 -- 2 record overall .
