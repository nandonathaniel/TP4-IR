In 1915 , 237 guns and 647 long tons ( 657 t ) of ammunition in the forts of the RFV had been removed , leaving only the heavy guns in retractable turrets . The conversion of the RFV to a conventional linear defence , with trenches and barbed wire began but proceeded slowly , after resources were sent west from Verdun for the Second Battle of Champagne ( 25 September -- 6 November 1915 ) . In October 1915 , building began on trench lines known as the first , second and third positions and in January 1916 , an inspection by General Noël de Castelnau , Chief of Staff at French General Headquarters ( GQG ) , reported that the new defences were satisfactory , except for small deficiencies in three areas . The fortress garrisons had been reduced to small maintenance crews and some of the forts had been readied for demolition . The maintenance garrisons were responsible to the central military bureaucracy in Paris and when the XXX Corps commander , General Chrétien , attempted to inspect Fort Douaumont in January 1916 , he was refused entry .
