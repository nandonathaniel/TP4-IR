Power Play , when it began in 2001 , was drawn with a special wheel . In 2006 and 2007 , MUSL replaced one of the 5 × spaces on the Power Play wheel with a 10 × . During each month - long promotion , MUSL guaranteed that there would be at least one drawing with a 10 × multiplier . The promotion returned in 2008 ; the ball landed in the 10 × space twice . After being absent in 2009 , the 10 × multiplier returned in May 2010 ( after the Power Play drawing was changed to RNG . ) The promotion was extended for the only time , as the 10 × multiplier was not drawn until June 12 . The second prize 5 × guarantee continued ; the 10 × applied to all non-jackpot prizes , as in previous promotions .
