Mystery religions , which offered initiates salvation in the afterlife , were a matter of personal choice for an individual , practised in addition to carrying on one 's family rites and participating in public religion . The mysteries , however , involved exclusive oaths and secrecy , conditions that conservative Romans viewed with suspicion as characteristic of `` magic '' , conspiracy ( coniuratio ) , and subversive activity . Sporadic and sometimes brutal attempts were made to suppress religionists who seemed to threaten traditional morality and unity . In Gaul , the power of the druids was checked , first by forbidding Roman citizens to belong to the order , and then by banning druidism altogether . At the same time , however , Celtic traditions were reinterpreted ( interpretatio romana ) within the context of Imperial theology , and a new Gallo - Roman religion coalesced , with its capital at the Sanctuary of the Three Gauls in Lugdunum ( present - day Lyon , France ) . The sanctuary established precedent for Western cult as a form of Roman - provincial identity .
