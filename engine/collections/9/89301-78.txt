In October 1911 the lease on Fitzroy Square was running out and Virginia and Adrian decided to give up their home on Fitzroy Square in favour of a different living arrangement , moving to a four - storied house at 38 Brunswick Square in Bloomsbury proper in November . Virginia saw it as a new opportunity , `` we are going to try all kinds of experiments '' , she told Ottoline Morrell . Adrian occupied the second floor , with Maynard Keynes and Duncan Grant sharing the ground floor . This arrangement for a single woman was considered scandalous , and George Duckworth was horrified . The house was adjacent to the Foundling Hospital , much to Virginia 's amusement as an unchaperoned single woman . Originally Ka Cox was supposed to share in the arrangements , but opposition came from Rupert Brooke , who was involved with her and pressured her to abandon the idea . At the house , Duncan Grant decorated Adrian Stephen 's rooms ( see image ) .
