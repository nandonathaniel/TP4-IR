In Taiwan ( Republic of China ) and Hong Kong , history textbooks often present the Boxer as irrational and xenophobic . But in the People 's Republic of China , government textbooks described the Boxer movement as an anti-imperialist , patriotic peasant movement whose failure was due to the lack of leadership from the modern working class , and described the international army as an invading force . In recent decades , however , large - scale projects of village interviews and explorations of archival sources have led historians in China to take a more nuanced view . Some non-Chinese scholars , such as Joseph Esherick , have seen the movement as anti-imperialist ; while others hold that the concept `` nationalistic '' is anachronistic because the Chinese nation had not been formed and the Boxers were more concerned with regional issues . Paul Cohen 's recent study includes a survey of `` the Boxers as myth '' , showing how their memory was used in changing ways in 20th century China from the New Culture Movement to the Cultural Revolution .
