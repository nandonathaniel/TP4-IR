During the turbulent 1960s , Phi Delta Theta along with other social fraternities dealt with strong anti-fraternity sentiment from people who saw the Greek lettered communities as old world established institutions . This sentiment was not without reason . Although Phi Delta Theta attempted to revise its restrictive membership codes in the wake of World War II , as late as 1961 the national office made headlines by rejecting the pledge of a Jewish student at Lake Forest College . Later that same year the University of Wisconsin banned Phi Delta Theta from campus for barring Jews , African - Americans , and other minorities from membership .
