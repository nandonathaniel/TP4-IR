The CharlieCard is named after a fictional character in a folk music song `` M.T.A. '' , often called `` Charlie on the MTA '' , which concerns a man trapped forever on the Boston subway system -- then known as the Metropolitan Transit Authority , or MTA -- because he can not pay the 5 - cent surcharge required to leave the train . Since the card 's introduction , the Charlie character has been used on a variety of MBTA signs , including construction and directional signage .
