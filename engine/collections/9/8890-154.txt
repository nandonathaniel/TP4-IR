Every nation constructs and honors the memory of its founding ; following generations use it to establish its identity and define patriotism . The Revolution became the main source of the non-denominational `` American civil religion '' that has shaped patriotism , and the memory and meaning of the nation 's birth ever since . Key events and people were viewed as icons of fundamental virtues . Thus the Revolution produced a Moses - like leader ( George Washington ) , prophets ( Thomas Jefferson , Tom Paine ) , disciples ( Alexander Hamilton , James Madison ) and martyrs ( Boston Massacre , Nathan Hale ) , as well as devils ( Benedict Arnold ) . There are sacred places ( Valley Forge , Bunker Hill ) , rituals ( Boston Tea Party ) , emblems ( the new flag ) , sacred days ( Independence Day ) , and sacred scriptures whose every sentence is carefully studied ( The Declaration of Independence , the Constitution and the Bill of Rights ) .
