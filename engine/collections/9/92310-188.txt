Almost all of Vatican City 's more than 450 citizens either live inside the Vatican 's walls or serve in the Holy See 's diplomatic service in embassies ( called `` nunciature '' ; a papal ambassador is a `` nuncio '' ) around the world . The Vatican citizenry consists almost entirely of two groups : clergy , most of whom work in the service of the Holy See , and a very few as officials of the state ; and the Swiss Guard . Most of the 2,400 lay workers who comprise the majority of the Vatican workforce reside outside the Vatican and are citizens of Italy , while a few are citizens of other nations . As a result , all of the City 's actual citizens are Catholic as are all the places of worship .
