The Roman Catholic Church holds that one may build and use `` likenesses '' , as long as the object is not worshipped . Many Roman Catholic Churches and services feature images ; some feature statues . For Roman Catholics , this practice is understood as fulfilling the Second Commandment , as they understand that these images are not being worshipped .
