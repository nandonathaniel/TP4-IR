Having resolved their differences , Jones had Jackson sing his vocal overdubs through a six - foot - long cardboard tube . Jackson 's entire lead vocal was performed in one take ; he had received vocal training every morning throughout the production of the song . Jazz saxophonist Tom Scott played the lyricon . Bass guitarist Louis Johnson was then brought in and he played his part on every guitar he owned , before Jackson finally settled for a Yamaha bass . Greg Phillinganes was also drafted in and he played the keyboard . He later said of the song , `` ' Billie Jean ' is hot on every level . It 's hot rhythmically moving action got Michael excited . It 's hot sonically , because the instrumentation is so minimal , you can really hear everything . It 's hot melodically ... lyrically ( and ) vocally . It affects you physically , emotionally , even spiritually . ''
