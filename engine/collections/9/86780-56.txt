On October 14 , 2008 , in a press event at company headquarters , Apple officials announced a new 15 - inch MacBook Pro featuring a `` precision aluminum unibody enclosure '' and tapered sides similar to those of the MacBook Air . Designers shifted the MacBook Pro 's ports to the left side of the case , and moved the optical disc drive slot from the front to the right side , similar to the MacBook . The new MacBook Pros had two video cards , which the user could switch between : the Nvidia GeForce 9600M GT with either 256 or 512 MB of dedicated memory and a GeForce 9400M with 256 MB of shared system memory . Although the FireWire 400 port was removed , the FireWire 800 port was retained . The DVI port was replaced with a Mini DisplayPort receptacle . The original unibody MacBook Pro came with a user - removable battery ; Apple claimed five hours of use , with one reviewer reporting results closer to four on a continuous video battery stress test . Apple said that the battery would hold 80 percent of its charge after 300 recharges .
