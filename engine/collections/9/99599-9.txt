After the Bay of Pigs Invasion in April 1961 , which had been largely planned under the Eisenhower administration , but which Kennedy had been informed of and approved during the months preceding his presidency and in his first few months as president , the Cuban government declared that it now considered itself Marxist and socialist , and aligned with the Soviet Union . On September 4 , 1961 , partly in response , Congress passed the Foreign Assistance Act , a Cold War Act ( among many other measures ) which prohibited aid to Cuba and authorized the President to impose a complete trade embargo against Cuba .
