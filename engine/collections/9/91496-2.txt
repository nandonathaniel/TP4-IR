The thermionic valve was invented in 1904 by the English physicist John Ambrose Fleming . He developed a device he called an `` oscillation valve '' ( because it passes current in only one direction ) . The heated filament , or cathode , was capable of thermionic emission of electrons that would flow to the plate ( or anode ) when it was at a higher voltage . Electrons , however , could not pass in the reverse direction because the plate was not heated and thus not capable of thermionic emission of electrons . Later known as the Fleming valve , it could be used as a rectifier of alternating current and as a radio wave detector . This greatly improved the crystal set which rectified the radio signal using an early solid - state diode based on a crystal and a so - called cat 's whisker . However , what was still required was an amplifier .
