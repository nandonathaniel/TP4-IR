`` Standard dictionary '' is a tall order ! But in any case , I feel hyphens should be used with the `` re '' prefixes . Pairs of vowel letters such as ee and ea are single vowel sounds in English , so omitting the hyphen from re-align and re-elect indeed interrupts the flow of the language being read - the reader has to mentally divide the two vowel letters into two separate vowel instances . However , both forms are in common use , so once again I suggest we do not attempt to offer advice on this ( i.e. force a rule ) , save perhaps mentioning the issue . zoney â™£ talk 00 : 03 , 6 Dec 2004 ( UTC )
