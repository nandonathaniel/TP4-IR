As of 2010 , there are 118 known elements ( in this context , `` known '' means observed well enough , even from just a few decay products , to have been differentiated from other elements ) . Of these 118 elements , 94 occur naturally on Earth . Six of these occur in extreme trace quantities : technetium , atomic number 43 ; promethium , number 61 ; astatine , number 85 ; francium , number 87 ; neptunium , number 93 ; and plutonium , number 94 . These 94 elements have been detected in the universe at large , in the spectra of stars and also supernovae , where short - lived radioactive elements are newly being made . The first 94 elements have been detected directly on Earth as primordial nuclides present from the formation of the solar system , or as naturally occurring fission or transmutation products of uranium and thorium .
