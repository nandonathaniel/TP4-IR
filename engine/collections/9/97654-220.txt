The minimum holiday entitlement is now 28 days per year , but that can include public holidays , depending on the employee 's contract . England & Wales have eight , Scotland has nine , and Northern Ireland has ten permanent public holidays each year . The 28 days holiday entitlement means that if the government creates a one - off public holiday in a given year , it is not necessarily a day off and it does not add 1 day to employees ' holiday entitlement -- unless the employer says otherwise , which some do .
