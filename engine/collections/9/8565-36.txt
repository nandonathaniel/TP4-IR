'' Cousy figured the game must have gone out of control , just as when Cousy had 29 assists when the Celtics scored 173 points against Minneapolis . Boston coach Red Auerbach laughed , `` He 's playing against nobody . '' Bill Russell smiled and said , `` The Big Fella finally did it . '' In a conversation with Naulls after the game , Chamberlain predicted he would win his NBA championships but still be known for his individualism , versus Russell who was credited for making his team -- the Boston Celtics -- great . Two days after the historic feat , Chamberlain made a guest appearance on The Ed Sullivan Show .
