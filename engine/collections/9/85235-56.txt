When Flagler 's Florida East Coast Railroad was extended southward to Palm Beach and then Miami in the early 20th Century , the rich mostly abandoned St. Augustine . Wealthy vacationers began to customarily spend their winters in South Florida , where the climate was warmer and freezes were rare .

The tourist industry soon became the dominant sector of the local economy .
