The Burdekin River 's seasonal flooding made the establishment of a seaport north of the river essential to the nascent inland cattle industry . John Melton Black of Woodstock Station , an employee of Sydney entrepreneur and businessman Robert Towns , dispatched Andrew Ball , Mark Watt Reid and a detachment of 8 troopers of the Native Police to search for a suitable site . Ball 's party reached the Ross Creek in April 1864 and established a camp below the rocky spur of Melton Hill , near the present Customs House on The Strand . Edward Kennedy , a member of the surveying party , recalls the native police chasing local tribesmen into the ocean and ' pumping lead ' at them . On the return journey to Port Denison , the group ' dispersed ' another aboriginal clan , rounding up fifteen women ' who remained at the scene of combat ' and abducted them back to the barracks . No mention is made of the fate of any children . The first party of settlers , led by W.A. Ross , arrived at Cleveland Bay from Woodstock Station on 5 November of that year . In 1866 Robert Towns visited for three days , his first and only visit . He agreed to provide ongoing financial assistance to the new settlement and Townsville was named in his honour .
