Another short proof -- perhaps more commonly known -- of the irrationality of the golden ratio makes use of the closure of rational numbers under addition and multiplication . If 1 + 5 2 ( \ displaystyle \ textstyle ( \ frac ( 1 + ( \ sqrt ( 5 ) ) ) ( 2 ) ) ) is rational , then 2 ( 1 + 5 2 ) âˆ’ 1 = 5 ( \ displaystyle \ textstyle 2 \ left ( ( \ frac ( 1 + ( \ sqrt ( 5 ) ) ) ( 2 ) ) \ right ) - 1 = ( \ sqrt ( 5 ) ) ) is also rational , which is a contradiction if it is already known that the square root of a non-square natural number is irrational .
