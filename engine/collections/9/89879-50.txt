Different recognition sub-units are used for actin or tubulin although there is some overlap . In actin the subunits that bind with prefoldin are probably PFD3 and PFD4 , which bind in two places one between residues 60 - 79 and the other between residues 170 - 198 . The actin is recognized , loaded and delivered to the cytosolic chaperonin ( CCT ) in an open conformation by the inner end of prefoldin 's `` tentacles '' ( see the image and note ) . The contact when actin is delivered is so brief that a tertiary complex is not formed , immediately freeing the prefoldin .
