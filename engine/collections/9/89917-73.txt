The name `` Israel Hands '' was taken from that of a real pirate in Blackbeard 's crew , whom Blackbeard maimed ( by shooting him in the knee ) simply to ensure that his crew remained in terror of him . Allegedly , Hands was taken ashore to be treated for his injury and was not at Blackbeard 's last fight ( the incident is depicted in Tim Powers ' novel On Stranger Tides ) , and this alone saved him from the gallows . Supposedly , he later became a beggar in England .
