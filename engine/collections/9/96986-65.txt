Espiritu Santo , New Hebrides , was selected as the headquarters and the main base for the offensive , codenamed Operation Watchtower , with the commencement date set for 7 August 1942 . At first , the Allied offensive was planned just for Tulagi and the Santa Cruz Islands , omitting Guadalcanal . After Allied reconnaissance discovered the Japanese airfield construction efforts on Guadalcanal , its capture was added to the plan and the Santa Cruz operation was ( eventually ) dropped . The Japanese were aware , via signals intelligence , of the large - scale movement of Allied forces in the South Pacific area but concluded that the Allies were reinforcing Australia and perhaps Port Moresby in New Guinea .
