In North America , Westinghouse Air Brake supplied High Speed Control brake equipment for several post-World War II streamlined passenger trains . This was an electrically controlled overlay on conventional D - 22 passenger and 24 - RL locomotive brake equipment . On the conventional side , the control valve set a reference pressure in a volume , which set brake cylinder pressure via a relay valve . On the electric side , pressure from a second straight - air trainline controlled the relay valve via a two - way check valve . This `` straight air '' trainline was charged ( from reservoirs on each car ) and released by magnet valves on each car , controlled electrically by a 3 wire trainline , in turn controlled by an `` electro - pneumatic master controller '' in the controlling locomotive . This controller compared the pressure in the straight air trainline with that supplied by a self lapping portion of the engineers valve , signaling all of the `` apply '' or `` release '' magnets valves in the train to open simultaneously , changing the pressure in the `` straight air '' trainline much more rapidly and evenly than possible by simply supplying air directly from the locomotive . The relay valve was equipped with four diaphragms , magnet valves , electric control equipment , and an axle - mounted speed sensor , so that at speeds over 60 mph ( 97 km / h ) full braking force was applied , and reduced in steps at 60 mph ( 97 km / h ) 40 and 20 mph ( 64 and 32 km / h ) , bringing the train to a gentle stop . Each axle was also equipped with anti-lock brake equipment . The combination minimized braking distances , allowing more full - speed running between stops . The `` straight air '' ( electro - pneumatic trainline ) , anti-lock , and speed graduating portions of the system were not dependent on each other in any way , and any or all of these options could be supplied separately .
