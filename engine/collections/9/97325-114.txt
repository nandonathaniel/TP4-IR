Meanwhile , on 18 November Plymouth had surrendered to William , and on 21 November he began to advance . By 24 November , William 's forces were at Sherborne and on 1 December at Hindon . On 4 December he was at Amesbury , and was received by the mayor of Salisbury ; three days later they had reached Hungerford , where the following day they met with the King 's Commissioners to negotiate . James offered free elections and a general amnesty for the rebels . In reality , by that point James was simply playing for time , having already decided to flee the country . He feared that his English enemies would insist on his execution and that William would give in to their demands . Convinced that his army was unreliable , he sent orders to disband it . On 9 December , the two sides fought a second engagement with the Battle of Reading , a defeat for the King 's men .
