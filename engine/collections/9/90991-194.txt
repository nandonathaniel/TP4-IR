CSX Transportation operates a former Atlantic Coast Line Railroad branch line which sees daily rail traffic from north Tampa though Safety Harbor , Clearwater , and Largo . As of March 2008 , the portion that ran into downtown St. Petersburg and the adjacent western industrial areas was abandoned . There is a small rail yard to the northwest of downtown St. Petersburg at the new end of the rail line with several spur lines serving industries in the area .
