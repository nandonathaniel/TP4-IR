The river leaves the Volcanic Plateau at Karapiro , where it emerges from the Maungatautari Gorge , and flows northwest into the Waikato Basin , flowing through the towns of Cambridge , Hamilton , and Ngaruawahia . It is joined by its largest tributary , the Waipa River , at Ngaruawahia . It then flows north through the Taupiri Gorge to enter the lower Waikato region . Further north is Huntly and then Meremere , where the Whangamarino and Maramarua Rivers join it . From Mercer , where the Mangatawhiri River joins it , the Waikato flows west and southwest . Just before its mouth at Port Waikato , the Araroa River joins from the north . Numerous small islands lie in the long , thin delta of the river as it passes through low - lying swampy land between Meremere and the coast , the largest of which is Motutieke Island .
