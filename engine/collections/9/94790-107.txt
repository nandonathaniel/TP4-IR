The Revised Standard Version ( 1952 ) , an authorized revision of the American Standard Version of 1901 , replaced all 6,823 usages of Jehovah in the 1901 text with `` LORD '' or `` GOD '' , depending on whether the Hebrew of the verse in question is read `` Adonai '' or `` Elohim '' in Jewish practice . A footnote on Exodus 3 : 15 says : `` The word LORD when spelled with capital letters , stands for the divine name , YHWH . '' The preface states : `` The word ' Jehovah ' does not accurately represent any form of the name ever used in Hebrew '' . The New American Bible ( 1970 , revised 1986 , 1991 ) . Its footnote to Genesis 4 : 25 -- 26 says : `` ... men began to call God by his personal name , Yahweh , rendered as `` the LORD '' in this version of the Bible . '' The New American Standard Bible ( 1971 , updated 1995 ) , another revision of the 1901 American Standard Version , followed the example of the Revised Standard Version . Its footnotes to Exodus 3 : 14 and 6 : 3 state : `` Related to the name of God , YHWH , rendered LORD , which is derived from the verb HAYAH , to be '' ; `` Heb YHWH , usually rendered LORD '' . In its preface it says : `` It is known that for many years YHWH has been transliterated as Yahweh , however no complete certainty attaches to this pronunciation . '' The Bible in Today 's English ( Good News Bible ) , published by the American Bible Society ( 1976 ) . Its preface states : `` the distinctive Hebrew name for God ( usually transliterated Jehovah or Yahweh ) is in this translation represented by ' The Lord ' . '' A footnote to Exodus 3 : 14 states : `` I am sounds like the Hebrew name Yahweh traditionally transliterated as Jehovah . '' The New International Version ( 1978 , revised 2011 ) . Footnote to Exodus 3 : 15 , `` The Hebrew for LORD sounds like and may be related to the Hebrew for I AM in verse 14 . '' The New King James Version ( 1982 ) , though based on the King James Version , replaces JEHOVAH wherever it appears in the Authorized King James Version with `` LORD '' , and adds a note : `` Hebrew YHWH , traditionally Jehovah '' , except at Isaiah 12 : 2 and Isaiah 26 : 4 where the tetragrammaton is rendered `` Yah '' . The God 's Word Translation ( 1985 ) . The New Revised Standard Version ( 1990 ) , a revision of the Revised Standard Version uses `` LORD '' and `` GOD '' exclusively .
