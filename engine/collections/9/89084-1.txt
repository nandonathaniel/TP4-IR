The Buffalo National River was established by an Act of Congress on March 1 , 1972 , ending the recurring plans of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to construct one or more dams on the river . The National River designation protects natural rivers from industrial uses , impoundments and other obstructions that may change the natural character of the river or disrupt the natural habitat for the flora and fauna that live in or near the river .
