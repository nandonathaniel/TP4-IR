An applicant may contend , for example , that the respondent is in wrongful possession of the applicant 's motor vehicle , and has threatened to destroy it in the event of the applicant 's proceeding to court for its recovery . In such a case , the applicant would contend that , having received notice of the application , the respondent might very well destroy or dispose of the vehicle without a trace , prior to the applicant 's obtaining an order from the court for the return of the vehicle . The applicant will accordingly seek an order on an interim basis , directing that , pending the determination of the application , the vehicle be preserved .
