Symbolic interactionism is often related and connected with social structure . This concept suggests that symbolic interactionism is a construction of people 's social reality . It also implies that from a realistic point of view , the interpretations that are being made will not make much difference . When the reality of a situation is defined , the situation becomes a meaningful reality . There are many aspects and factors that go into this theory . This includes methodological criticisms , and critical sociological issues . A number of symbolic interactionists have addressed these topics , the best known being Sheldon Stryker 's structural symbolic interactionism and the formulations of interactionism heavily influenced by this approach ( sometimes referred to as the `` Indiana School '' of symbolic interactionism ) , including the works of key scholars in sociology and psychology using different methods and theories applying a structural version of interactionism that are represented in a 2003 collection edited by Burke et al . Another well - known structural variation of symbolic interactionism that applies quantitative methods is Manford H. Kuhn 's ( Kuhn and McPartland , 1954 ) formulation which is often referred to in sociological literature as the `` Iowa School '' . `` Negotiated order theory '' also applies a structural approach .
