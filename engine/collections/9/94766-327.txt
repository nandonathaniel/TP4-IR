In response to the early success of the offensive , on 6 January Churchill contacted Stalin to request that the Soviets put pressure on the Germans on the Eastern Front . On 12 January , the Soviets began the massive Vistula -- Oder Offensive , originally planned for 20 January . It had been brought forward from 20 January to 12 January because meteorological reports warned of a thaw later in the month , and the tanks needed hard ground for the offensive ( and the advance of the Red Army was assisted by two Panzer Armies ( 5th & 6th ) being redeployed for the Ardennes attack ) .
