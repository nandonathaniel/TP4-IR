To refer the god in Hindu , the oath used to use sentence `` In the name of Sang Hyang Widhi '' , and later `` Om Swastiastu '' . There was also a time when Christian and Catholic ministers said `` I swear '' instead of promise at the beginning of the oath , did not mention any reference to God . The verses `` to seek the welfare '' was removed since it reflected the dictatorial New Order era .
