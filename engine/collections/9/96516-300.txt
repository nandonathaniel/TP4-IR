After Aurangzeb 's death in 1707 , Shahu , son of Sambhaji ( and grandson of Shivaji ) , was released by Bahadur Shah I , the new Mughal emperor . His mother was kept as a hostage of the Mughals , however , in order to ensure that Shahu adhered to the release conditions . Upon release , Shahu immediately claimed the Maratha throne and challenged his aunt Tarabai and her son . This promptly turned the now - spluttering Mughal - Maratha war into a three - cornered affair . The states of Satara and Kolhapur came into being in 1707 because of the succession dispute over the Maratha kingship . Shahu appointed Balaji Vishwanath as Peshwa . The Peshwa was instrumental in getting Shahu accepted as rightful heir of Shivaji and the Chhatrapati of the Marathas by The Mughals . Balaji also got Shahu 's mother , Yesubai , released from Mughal captivity in 1719 .
