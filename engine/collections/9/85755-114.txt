Obama 's campaign used the slogan `` Change we can believe in '' and the chant `` Yes We Can '' . The latter slogan is shared with the United Farm Workers and associated with its founder César Chávez and is well known amongst Latinos in its Spanish form Sí se puede . The `` Change we can believe in '' has been used in parodies both during and since the campaign . John McCain attempted to criticize Obama by enumerating various controversial policy positions he allegedly took and proclaiming `` that 's not change we can believe in '' alongside a banner proclaiming McCain as `` a leader we can believe in '' . Since the campaign it has been used to parody campaigns against incumbents as being `` change you ca n't believe in '' such as by British blog LeftFootForward against David Cameron or by the Economist against the People 's Democratic Party of Tajikistan .
