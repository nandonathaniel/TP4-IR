Kumbhakarna -- One of the most jovial demons in Hindu history . When offered a boon by Brahma , he was tricked into asking for eternal sleep . A horrified Ravana , out of brotherly love , persuaded Brahma to amend the boon . Brahma mitigated the power of the boon by making Kumbhakarna sleep for six months and being awake for rest six months of a year ( in some versions , he is awake for one day out of the year ) . During the war with Rama , Kumbhakarna was untimely awakened from his sleep . He tried to persuade Ravana to open negotiations with Rama and return Sita to him . But he too failed to mend the ways of Ravana . However , bound by a brother 's duty , he fought on the side of Ravana and was killed in the battlefield . Before dying he met Vibhishana and blessed him for following path of righteousness .
