Richard Castle ( Fillion ) is a famous mystery novelist . Bored and suffering from writer 's block , he kills off the main character in his successful book series . He is brought in by the New York Police Department for questioning regarding a copy - cat murder based on one of his novels . He is intrigued by Kate Beckett ( Katic ) , the detective assigned to the case . Castle decides to use Beckett as his muse for Nikki Heat , the main character of his next book series and uses his friendship with the mayor to force the police to let him shadow Beckett . Castle 's exuberant man child personality clashes with Beckett 's more reserved and professional demeanor , but the two eventually become friends and then lovers . Their cases often deal with murders occurring within various unusual subcultures or milieus , including reality TV shows , vampire enthusiasts , a science fiction convention , and a man who claims to be a time traveler . A recurring plot line deals with the unsolved murder of Beckett 's mother years before , an investigation which leads to an increasingly sprawling , and dangerous , conspiracy .
