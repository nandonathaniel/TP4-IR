More than 56 % of the dust fertilizing the Amazon rainforest comes from the Bodélé depression in Northern Chad in the Sahara desert . The dust contains phosphorus , important for plant growth . The yearly Sahara dust replaces the equivalent amount of phosphorus washed away yearly in Amazon soil from rains and floods . Up to 50 million tonnes of Sahara dust per year are blown across the Atlantic Ocean .
