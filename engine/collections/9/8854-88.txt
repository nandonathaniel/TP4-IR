Preparations for NAFTA included cancellation of Article 27 of Mexico 's constitution , the cornerstone of Emiliano Zapata 's revolution in 1910 -- 1919 . Under the historic Article 27 , Indian communal landholdings were protected from sale or privatization . However , this barrier to investment was incompatible with NAFTA . Indian farmers feared the loss of their remaining lands , and also feared cheap imports ( substitutes ) from the US . The Zapatistas labelled NAFTA a `` death sentence '' to Indian communities all over Mexico . Then EZLN declared war on the Mexican state on January 1 , 1994 , the day NAFTA came into force .
