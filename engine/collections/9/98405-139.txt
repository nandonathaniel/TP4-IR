Though the Arkansas - Texas game has not been regularly played since Arkansas 's departure from the Southwest Conference in 1991 , the Longhorns are still considered by many to be the Razorbacks ' top rival . There are several reasons for this , including the result of the 1969 Game of the Century ( also known as `` The Big Shootout '' ) , which eventually led to the Longhorns ' 1969 national championship . The Longhorns won the meeting in 2008 , 52 -- 10 . The Razorbacks and Longhorns revived the rivalry in the 2014 Texas Bowl with Arkansas earning a 31 -- 7 victory , also giving Coach Bret Bielema his first bowl win at Arkansas .
