Chopin seldom performed publicly in Paris . In later years he generally gave a single annual concert at the Salle Pleyel , a venue that seated three hundred . He played more frequently at salons , but preferred playing at his own Paris apartment for small groups of friends . The musicologist Arthur Hedley has observed that `` As a pianist Chopin was unique in acquiring a reputation of the highest order on the basis of a minimum of public appearances -- few more than thirty in the course of his lifetime . '' The list of musicians who took part in some of his concerts provides an indication of the richness of Parisian artistic life during this period . Examples include a concert on 23 March 1833 , in which Chopin , Liszt and Hiller performed ( on pianos ) a concerto by J.S. Bach for three keyboards ; and , on 3 March 1838 , a concert in which Chopin , his pupil Adolphe Gutmann , Charles - Valentin Alkan , and Alkan 's teacher Joseph Zimmermann performed Alkan 's arrangement , for eight hands , of two movements from Beethoven 's 7th symphony . Chopin was also involved in the composition of Liszt 's Hexameron ; he wrote the sixth ( and final ) variation on Bellini 's theme . Chopin 's music soon found success with publishers , and in 1833 he contracted with Maurice Schlesinger , who arranged for it to be published not only in France but , through his family connections , also in Germany and England .
