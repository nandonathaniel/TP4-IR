Neoptolemus , following the advice of Helenus , who accompanied him when he traveled over land , was always accompanied by Andromache . He met Odysseus and they buried Achilles ' teacher Phoenix on the land of the Ciconians . They then conquered the land of the Molossians ( Epirus ) and Neoptolemus had a child by Andromache , Molossus , to whom he later gave the throne . Thus the kings of Epirus claimed their lineage from Achilles , and so did Alexander the Great , whose mother was of that royal house . Alexander the Great and the kings of Macedon also claimed to be descended from Heracles . Helenus founded a city in Molossia and inhabited it , and Neoptolemus gave him his mother Deidamia as wife . After Peleus died he succeeded Phtia 's throne . He had a feud with Orestes ( son of Agamemnon ) over Menelaus ' daughter Hermione , and was killed in Delphi , where he was buried . In Roman myths , the kingdom of Phtia was taken over by Helenus , who married Andromache . They offered hospitality to other Trojan refugees , including Aeneas , who paid a visit there during his wanderings .
