Many industries have formulated `` voluntary '' codes limiting the content of expression , generally affecting perceived effects on public morality rather than revelation of secrets . Examples of these include the Hays Code , which affected Hollywood films from the 1930s to the 1950s , and the Comics Code , which was designed to deal with the rise of horror comics in the 1950s and lasted into the 1970s . The movie rating system currently in effect in the United States , run by the Motion Picture Association of America ( MPAA ) is another such industry code . Such codes have generally been adopted with the twofold purposes of forestalling possible government intervention , and avoiding unfavorable publicity or boycotts . While such codes are not generally enforced by governmental action , they are generally enforced on content producers by gatekeepers in the marketing chain : studios in the case of the Hays Code , distributors in the case of the Comics Code , and theater chains in the case of the MPAA rating system . Content producers have often objected to these codes , and argue that they are , in effect , a form of prior restraint . However , the first amendment prohibition of prior restraint applies to government or court action , and does not bind private entities such as theater chains .
