As the junior field agent of the team , McGee is often subject to teasing from DiNozzo and Kate and Ziva , often together ( though Kate and Ziva 's teasing is not as mean - spirited as DiNozzo 's ) , and , to some extent , Gibbs , though he does n't come to head - smack him until later , unlike Kate and DiNozzo , who do so simultaneously on the day of his promotion almost immediately after Tim mentioned the word ' hazing ' . In one episode , Gibbs walked into the lab , found him lying on the floor on his back while working on the underside of Abby 's hotbox , and quipped , `` Special Agent Goodwrench ? '' In `` Forced Entry '' , he is tricked by Tony and Kate into drinking Gibbs ' coffee , which is considered a major taboo . In subsequent episodes , Tony often pulls his seniority card by taking advantage of McGee 's naivete and tricking him into performing less desirable tasks such as searching for a gun in a muddy ditch with only a metal detector and bagging bear poo while investigating a bear attack , brushing off McGee 's protests with `` because I can '' . In `` Singled Out '' , a frustrated McGee futilely tells Tony to stop calling him `` probie '' ; Gibbs later tells McGee that his former mentor Mike Franks still calls him `` probie '' even though he retired nearly a decade ago . McGee 's most notable nicknames come from DiNozzo , either `` Probie '' , due to his junior ( probational ) status on the team , or `` McGeek '' , alluding to McGee 's intelligence . DiNozzo uses multiple variations on both of these names to make fun of McGee , some of which are clever but not demeaning ( McGPS , McProof , The Great McOz ) , some which are mocking ( McLawyer , McGiggle , McGoo , McNerd , McFlowerPower ) , some of which seem irrelevant ( McTim ) , and some intended to deliberately cause offense ( Baldy McBald ) . When Tony discovers that McGee 's online gaming name was `` Elf Lord '' , it is often referenced by the team members through jokes and light - hearted teasing ; Gibbs has occasionally called him Elf Lord in Season 5 .
