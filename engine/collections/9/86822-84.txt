During the conflict , many new models of bolt - action rifles were produced as a result of lessons learned from the First World War with the designs of a number of bolt - action infantry rifles being modified in order to speed up production as well as to make the rifles more compact and easier to handle . Examples of bolt - action rifles that were used during World War II include the German Mauser Kar98k , the British Lee -- Enfield No. 4 , and the Springfield M1903A3 . During the course of World War II , bolt - action rifles and carbines were modified even further to meet new forms of warfare the armies of certain nations faced e.g. urban warfare and jungle warfare . Examples include the Soviet Mosin -- Nagant M1944 carbine , which were developed by the Soviets as a result of the Red Army 's experiences with urban warfare e.g. the Battle of Stalingrad , and the British Lee -- Enfield No. 5 carbine , that were developed for British and Commonwealth forces fighting the Japanese in South - East Asia and the Pacific .
