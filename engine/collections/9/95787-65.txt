For the nations that remained in Kansas beyond 1854 , the Kansas -- Nebraska Act introduced a host of other problems . In 1855 , white `` squatters '' built the city of Leavenworth on the Delaware reservation without the consent of either the Delaware or the US government . When Commissioner of Indian Affairs George Manypenny ordered for military support in removing the squatters , both the military and the squatters refused to comply , undermining both Federal authority and the treaties in place with the Delaware . In addition to the violations of treaty agreements , other promises made were not being kept . Construction and infrastructure improvement projects dedicated in nearly every treaty , for example , took a great deal longer than expected . Beyond that , however , the most damaging violation by White American settlers was the mistreatment of Native Americans and their properties . Personal maltreatment , stolen property , and deforestation have all been cited . Furthermore , the squatters ' premature and illegal settlement of the Kansas Territory jeopardized the value of the land and , with it , the future of the Indian tribes living on them . Because treaties were land cessions and purchases , the value of the land handed over to the Federal government was critical to the payment received by a given Native nation . Deforestation , destruction of property , and other general injuries to the land lowered the value of the territories that were ceded by the Kansas Territory tribes .
