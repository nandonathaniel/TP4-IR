Inside the cell Two types of alpha chains are formed during translation on ribosomes along the rough endoplasmic reticulum ( RER ) : alpha - 1 and alpha - 2 chains . These peptide chains ( known as preprocollagen ) have registration peptides on each end and a signal peptide . Polypeptide chains are released into the lumen of the RER . Signal peptides are cleaved inside the RER and the chains are now known as pro-alpha chains . Hydroxylation of lysine and proline amino acids occurs inside the lumen . This process is dependent on ascorbic acid ( vitamin C ) as a cofactor . Glycosylation of specific hydroxylysine residues occurs . Triple alpha helical structure is formed inside the endoplasmic reticulum from two alpha - 1 chains and one alpha - 2 chain . Procollagen is shipped to the Golgi apparatus , where it is packaged and secreted by exocytosis .
