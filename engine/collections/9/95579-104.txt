The Greek world is widely regarded as having given birth to scientific thought by means of observation , thought , and development of a theory without the intervention of a supernatural force . Thales , Anaximander and Democritus were amongst those contributing significantly to the establishment of this tradition . It is also , and perhaps more commonly in the western imagination , identified with the dawn of Western philosophy , as well as a mapping out of the natural sciences . Greek developments of mathematics continued well up until the decline of the Byzantine Empire . In the modern era Greeks continue to contribute to the fields of science , mathematics and philosophy .
