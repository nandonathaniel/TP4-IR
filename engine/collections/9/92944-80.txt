A hermaphrodite is an organism that has both male and female reproductive organs . Until the mid-20th century , `` hermaphrodite '' was used synonymously with `` intersex '' . The distinctions `` male pseudohermaphrodite '' , `` female pseudohermaphrodite '' and especially `` true hermaphrodite '' are vestiges of outdated 19th - century thinking , reflecting histology ( microscopic appearance ) of the gonads . Medical terminology has shifted not only due to concerns about language , but also a shift to understandings based on genetics .
