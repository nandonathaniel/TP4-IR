These quarks and leptons interact through four fundamental forces : gravity , electromagnetism , weak interactions , and strong interactions . The Standard Model of particle physics is currently the best explanation for all of physics , but despite decades of efforts , gravity can not yet be accounted for at the quantum level ; it is only described by classical physics ( see quantum gravity and graviton ) .
