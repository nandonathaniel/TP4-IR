The Department of Mysteries , located on Level Nine , is a department in the Ministry of Magic which studies particular enigmas ( death , time , space , thought , and love ) and stores copies of prophecies made in the Harry Potter universe . During Voldemort 's discriminatory regime , he forces the department to lie and claim that Muggle - borns actually steal magic from Pure - bloods , making them `` illegal magicals '' and allowing their arrest .
