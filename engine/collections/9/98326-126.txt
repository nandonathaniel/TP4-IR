When the Supreme Court started abolishing New Deal programs as unconstitutional , Roosevelt launched a surprise counter-attack in early 1937 . He proposed adding five new justices , but conservative Democrats revolted , led by the Vice President . The Judiciary Reorganization Bill of 1937 failed -- it never reached a vote . Momentum in Congress and public opinion shifted to the right and very little new legislation was passed expanding the New Deal . However , retirements allowed Roosevelt to put supporters on the Court and it stopped killing New Deal programs .
