In physics and engineering , in particular fluid dynamics and hydrometry , the volumetric flow rate ( also known as volume flow rate , rate of fluid flow or volume velocity ) is the volume of fluid which passes per unit time ; usually represented by the symbol Q ( sometimes VÌ‡ ) . The SI unit is m / s ( cubic metres per second ) . Another unit used is sccm ( standard cubic centimeters per minute ) .
