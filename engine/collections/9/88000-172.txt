Fiji 's larger islands have extensive bus routes that are affordable and consistent in service . There are bus stops , and in rural areas buses are often simply hailed as they approach . Buses are the principal form of public transport and passenger movement between the towns on the main islands . Buses also serve on roll - on - roll - off inter-island ferries . Bus fares and routes are heavily regulated by the Land Transport Authority ( LTA ) . Bus and taxi drivers hold Public Service Licenses ( PSVs ) issued by the LTA .
