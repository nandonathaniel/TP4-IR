In sharp contrast , the founding publisher and editor of Poetry , Harriet Monroe , emphasized the folksy New England persona and characters in Frost 's work , writing that `` perhaps no other poet in our history has put the best of the Yankee spirit into a book so completely . '' She notes his frequent use of rural settings and farm life , and she likes that in these poems , Frost is most interested in `` showing the human reaction to nature 's processes . '' She also notes that while Frost 's narrative , character - based poems are often satirical , Frost always has a `` sympathetic humor '' towards his subjects .
