In 1823 , the family moved to Georgetown , Ohio , where five more siblings were born : Simpson , Clara , Orvil , Jennie , and Mary . At the age of five , Ulysses began his formal education , starting at a subscription school and later in two private schools . In the winter of 1836 -- 1837 , Grant was a student at Maysville Seminary , and in the autumn of 1838 he attended John Rankin 's academy . In his youth , Grant developed an unusual ability to ride and manage horses . Since Grant expressed a strong dislike for the tannery his father put his ability with horses to use by giving him work driving wagon loads of supplies and transporting people . Unlike his siblings , Grant was not forced to attend church by his Methodist parents . For the rest of his life , he prayed privately and never officially joined any denomination . To others , including late in life , his own son , Grant appeared to be an agnostic . He inherited some of Hannah 's Methodist piety and quiet nature while adopting his father 's Whig political inclinations .
