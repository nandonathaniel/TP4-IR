The film was released in approximately 70 countries . Outside the US and Canada , it opened across 15 markets and 69 IMAX screens a week ahead of its US debut , and faced notable competition from newcomer The Huntsman : Winter 's War and holdover Batman v Superman : Dawn of Justice , the latter of which was entering its third weekend . The reason behind the divided release pattern was because Disney wanted to get some space before Captain America : Civil War releases in early May , as well as availing school holidays and avoiding local competitors . It eventually grossed $31.7 million , debuting at first place in all markets and second overall at the international box office , behind Dawn of Justice , which was playing across 67 markets . In its second weekend , it expanded to an additional 49 countries ( 88 % of its total marketplace ) and grossed $138.6 million from 64 countries , easily topping the international box office , a bulk of it came from China . Approximately 63 % or $85 million of that came from 3D screenings , with the largest 3D opening haul represented by China ( 98 % ) , Germany ( 83 % ) , Brazil ( 73 % ) , Russia ( 60 % ) , Mexico ( 47 % ) , and the UK ( 39 % ) . $10 million alone came from 525 IMAX screens , a record for a PG and April release . It further continued to hold the top spot in its third weekend after adding another $98.9 million from 53 territories , falling only by a marginal 32 % . IMAX generated another $6.1 million from 484 IMAX theaters for a three - weekend total of $20.6 million . After three straight No. 1 runs , it was finally dethroned by the studio 's Captain America : Civil War in its fourth weekend .
