The method is quite distinct from that described above in Gregorian calendar . For a general year , one first determines the golden number , then one uses three tables to determine the Sunday letter , a `` cypher '' , and the date of the paschal full moon , from which the date of Easter Sunday follows . The epact does not explicitly appear . Simpler tables can be used for limited periods ( such as 1900 -- 2199 ) during which the cypher ( which represents the effect of the solar and lunar corrections ) does not change . Clavius ' details were employed in the construction of the method , but they play no subsequent part in its use .
