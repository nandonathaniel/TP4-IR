Certain types of encryption , by their mathematical properties , can not be defeated by brute force . An example of this is one - time pad cryptography , where every cleartext bit has a corresponding key from a truly random sequence of key bits . A 140 character one - time - pad - encoded string subjected to a brute - force attack would eventually reveal every 140 character string possible , including the correct answer -- but of all the answers given , there would be no way of knowing which was the correct one . Defeating such a system , as was done by the Venona project , generally relies not on pure cryptography , but upon mistakes in its implementation : the key pads not being truly random , intercepted keypads , operators making mistakes -- or other errors .
