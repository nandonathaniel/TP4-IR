The British royal family is financed mainly by the hereditary revenues of the Crown . The British Parliament uses a percentage of the Crown Estate , a part of the Crown 's hereditary revenues belonging to the sovereign that is placed at the disposal of the House of Commons , to meet the costs of the sovereign 's official expenditures . This includes the costs of the upkeep of the various royal residences , staffing , travel and state visits , public engagements , and official entertainment . Other sources of income include revenues from the Duchies of Lancaster and Cornwall , a parliamentary annuity , and income from private investments . The Keeper of the Privy Purse is Head of the Privy Purse and Treasurer 's Office and has overall responsibility for the management of the sovereign 's financial affairs .
