`` Tears in Heaven '' is a song by Eric Clapton and Will Jennings , from the 1991 Rush film soundtrack . In an interview with Sue Lawley in 1992 , Clapton said of the song , `` There is a song that I 've written for a movie , but in actual fact it was in the back of my head but it did n't really have a reason for being until I was scoring this movie which I did a little while ago and then it sort of had a reason to be . And it is a little ambiguous because it could be taken to be about Conor but it also is meant to be part of the film . '' Conor , Clapton 's four - year - old son , fell from a window of a 53rd - floor New York apartment owned by his mother 's friend on March 20 , 1991 . Clapton arrived at the apartment shortly after the accident .
