The history of the area can be traced back to 200 -- 300 AD . A ruin of a city built by Chand Sadagar has been found in the Baghmara Forest Block . During the Mughal period , the Mughal Kings leased the forests of the Sundarbans to nearby residents . Many criminals took refuge in the Sundarbans from the advancing armies of Emperor Akbar . Many have been known to be attacked by tigers . Many of the buildings which were built by them later fell to hands of Portuguese pirates , salt smugglers and dacoits in the 17th century . Evidence of the fact can be traced from the ruins at Netidhopani and other places scattered all over Sundarbans . The legal status of the forests underwent a series of changes , including the distinction of being the first mangrove forest in the world to be brought under scientific management . The area was mapped first in Persian , by the Surveyor General as early as 1764 following soon after proprietary rights were obtained from the Mughal Emperor Alamgir II by the British East India Company in 1757 . Systematic management of this forest tract started in the 1860s after the establishment of a Forest Department in the Province of Bengal , in British India . The management was entirely designed to extract whatever treasures were available , but labour and lower management mostly were staffed by locals , as the British had no expertise or adaptation experience in mangrove forests .
