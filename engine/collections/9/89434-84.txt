In May 2017 , ahead of the fifth season renewal , showrunner and executive producer Jed Whedon said the writers were not sure what would happen in the season , and that it would be `` by the seat of our pants . '' The season explores the ramifications of Phil Coulson making a deal with Ghost Rider at the end of the previous season , as well as the groundwork laid by Aida for humans to fear S.H.I.E.L.D. and Inhumans . Whedon stated , `` The public perception of S.H.I.E.L.D. is at an all - time low , so we have not resolved that , and there will be still more fallout from it . '' Moving beyond the Framework reality established at the end of season four , Tancharoen said the emotional impact from the characters ' experiences would `` be something that resonates throughout the season '' , especially for Fitz and Mack . When asked if the season would be broken into pods as with season four , executive producer Jeffrey Bell said , `` A 22 - episode arc is a lot for people to hold onto . By breaking it up into either smaller arcs or different pods , by introducing a set of antagonists and putting them down , or moving from space to space , our experience has been that it 's something the viewers enjoy , and it makes it a little easier to digest when you 're telling some of these stories . '' However , Whedon noted that it would depend on how the season would be aired as to where the story is broken up . The season ultimately was broken into two pod story arcs , with each pod having a different emphases , but the whole season having an arc `` that will pay off '' . The writers for the season began work at the end of May 2017 .
