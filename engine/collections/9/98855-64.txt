Despite the inherent difficulties in accounting for inflation , several attempts have been made . Estimates depend on the price index used to adjust the grosses , and the exchange rates used to convert between currencies can also impact upon the calculations , both of which can have an effect on the ultimate rankings of an inflation adjusted list . Gone with the Wind -- first released in 1939 -- is generally considered to be the most successful film , with Guinness World Records in 2014 estimating its adjusted global gross at $3.4 billion . Estimates for Gone with the Wind 's adjusted gross have varied substantially : its owner , Turner Entertainment , estimated its adjusted earnings at $3.3 billion in 2007 , a few years earlier than the Guinness estimate ; other estimates fall either side of this amount , with one putting its gross just under $3 billion in 2010 , while another provided an alternative figure of $3.8 billion in 2006 . Which film is Gone with the Wind 's nearest rival depends on the set of figures used : Guinness had Avatar in second place with $3 billion , while other estimates saw Titanic in the runner - up spot with first - run worldwide earnings of almost $2.9 billion at 2010 prices . The only other film that all sources agreed grossed in excess of $2 billion at recent prices is Star Wars ; according to Guinness it has earned $2.8 billion at 2014 price levels , while other sources from 2010 / 2011 put its adjusted earnings at $2.2 -- 2.6 billion .
