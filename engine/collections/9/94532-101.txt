Labour and civil unrest broke out in the British colony of Malaya in 1946 . A state of emergency was declared by the colonial authorities in 1948 with the outbreak of acts of terrorism . The situation deteriorated into a full - scale anti-colonial insurgency , or Anti-British National Liberation War as the insurgents referred to it , led by the Malayan National Liberation Army ( MNLA ) , the military wing of the Malayan Communist Party . The Malayan Emergency would endure for the next 12 years , ending in 1960 . In 1967 , communist leader Chin Peng reopened hostilities , culminating in a second emergency that lasted until 1989 .
