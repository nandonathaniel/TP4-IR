These animals are typically hunted on a fee for each kill , with hunters paying $4,000 or more to be able to hunt exotic game . As many of these species are endangered or threatened in their native habitat , the United States ' government requires 10 % of the hunting fee to be given to conservation efforts in the areas where these animals are indigenous . Hunting of endangered animals in the United States is normally illegal under the Endangered Species Act , but is permitted on these ranches since the rare animals hunted there are not indigenous to the United States .
