Although the Charter of 1215 was a failure as a peace treaty , it was resurrected under the new government of the young Henry III as a way of drawing support away from the rebel faction . On his deathbed , King John appointed a council of thirteen executors to help Henry reclaim the kingdom , and requested that his son be placed into the guardianship of William Marshal , one of the most famous knights in England . William knighted the boy , and Cardinal Guala Bicchieri , the papal legate to England , then oversaw his coronation at Gloucester Cathedral on 28 October .
