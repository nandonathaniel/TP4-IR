Catholic social teaching is based on the teaching of Jesus and commits Catholics to the welfare of all others . Although the Catholic Church operates numerous social ministries throughout the world , individual Catholics are also required to practice spiritual and corporal works of mercy . Corporal works of mercy include feeding the hungry , welcoming strangers , immigrants or refugees , clothing the naked , taking care of the sick and visiting those in prison . Spiritual works require the Catholic to share their knowledge with others , comfort those who suffer , have patience , forgive those who hurt them , give advice and correction to those who need it , and pray for the living and the dead .
