The comment from Jody , Janie 's second husband , attempts to suppress her voice and manipulate her thoughts . Rather than acting submissive to Jody , Janie for a brief moment contends with Jody by telling him how men misunderstand women . Jody fears that Janie 's thinking will lead to her gaining more knowledge and naturally to speaking her mind , eventually leading to Janie achieving the power of knowledge to recognize and change the mistreatment and unfairness she has been receiving . Bernard proposes the idea that Jody 's relationship with Janie represents society 's assumption that women are of limited cognition . This assumption positions women in subservient roles that limit their ways of thinking , speaking , and seeing .
