In reality , there is nothing at absolute rest . For example , Earth 's gravitation constantly pulls objects toward its surface , while Earth is one of the objects the Sun constantly pulls towards itself , causing it to orbit the Sun ; the Sun , in turn , orbits the center of the Milky Way ; and so on. Two or more than two objects are said to be at rest , if its position with respect to each other is not changing or moving with uniform velocity with respect to each other. Rest and motion are relative term .
