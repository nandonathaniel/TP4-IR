A delta - encoded ADC or counter-ramp has an up - down counter that feeds a digital to analog converter ( DAC ) . The input signal and the DAC both go to a comparator . The comparator controls the counter . The circuit uses negative feedback from the comparator to adjust the counter until the DAC 's output is close enough to the input signal . The number is read from the counter . Delta converters have very wide ranges and high resolution , but the conversion time is dependent on the input signal level , though it will always have a guaranteed worst - case . Delta converters are often very good choices to read real - world signals . Most signals from physical systems do not change abruptly . Some converters combine the delta and successive approximation approaches ; this works especially well when high frequencies are known to be small in magnitude .
