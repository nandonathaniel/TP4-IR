Within a mold , the reinforcing and matrix materials are combined , compacted , and cured ( processed ) to undergo a melding event . After the melding event , the part shape is essentially set , although it can deform under certain process conditions . For a thermoset polymer matrix material , the melding event is a curing reaction that is initiated by the application of additional heat or chemical reactivity such as an organic peroxide . For a thermoplastic polymeric matrix material , the melding event is a solidification from the melted state . For a metal matrix material such as titanium foil , the melding event is a fusing at high pressure and a temperature near the melting point .
