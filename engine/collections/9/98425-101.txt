Lord Chelmsford , the Commander - in - Chief of British forces during the war , initially planned a five - pronged invasion of Zululand composed of over 15,000 troops in five columns and designed to encircle the Zulu army and force it to fight as he was concerned that the Zulus would avoid battle . In the event , Chelmsford settled on three invading columns with the main center column , now consisting of some 7,800 men comprising the previously called No. 3 Column and Durnford 's No. 2 Column , under his direct command . He moved his troops from Pietermaritzburg to a forward camp at Helpmekaar , past Greytown . On 9 January 1879 they moved to Rorke 's Drift , and early on 11 January commenced crossing the Buffalo River into Zululand . Three columns were to invade Zululand , from the Lower Tugela , Rorke 's Drift , and Utrecht respectively , their objective being Ulundi , the royal capital .
