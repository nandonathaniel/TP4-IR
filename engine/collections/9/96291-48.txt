Territorial expansion of the Kingdom of Prussia , which in the 19th century would lead the future German reunification efforts , started with the annexation of territories belonging to the Polish -- Lithuanian Commonwealth . Between 1772 and 1795 , Prussia took 141,400 km2 ( 54,600 sq mi ) of the Commonwealth 's western territory -- areas known as Greater Poland , Pomorze and Mazovia ( renaming them as South Prussia , West Prussia and New East Prussia ) -- and with it nearly 1 million Polish speaking inhabitants . Frederick the Great immediately sent 57,475 German families to the newly conquered lands in order to solidify his new acquisitions , and abolished the use of the Polish language .
