Rocket joins the new Guardians of the Galaxy at the behest of his friend Star - Lord . It is he who suggests that the team adopt that moniker after hearing it mentioned by Major Victory . Later , when the team almost disbands and Peter Quill ( Star - Lord ) disappears ( sent into the Negative Zone by Ronan ) , Rocket keeps the team alive , and brings in Groot as member , as they had become firm friends . Rocket takes over as leader until they rescue Peter and save the Earth from an alien invasion . When the team tries to halt the growing War of Kings , Rocket leads the portion of the team assigned to make contact with the Shi'ar . They are unable to teleport into the Emperor Vulcan 's flagship and have to be rescued by the Starjammers and Rocket 's old friend Ch'od . They are able to bring back the rightful queen of the Shi'ar , but she is killed after Rocket departs , much to his horror .
