President Polk ordered General Taylor and his forces south to the Rio Grande , entering the territory that Mexicans disputed . Mexico laid claim to all the lands as far north as the Nueces River -- about 150 mi ( 240 km ) north of the Rio Grande . The U.S. claimed that the border was the Rio Grande , citing the 1836 Treaties of Velasco . However , Mexico rejected the treaties and refused to negotiate , instead still claiming all of Texas . Taylor ignored Mexican demands to withdraw to the Nueces . He constructed a makeshift fort ( later known as Fort Brown / Fort Texas ) on the banks of the Rio Grande opposite the city of Matamoros , Tamaulipas .
