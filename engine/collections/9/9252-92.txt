Fishing , as an economic activity , and making a living from the sea , is an important part of conch culture . Sponge - diving , conch diving , crabbing , lobstering and other commercial fishing have been important parts of conch culture . Commercial fishing is now less important to conch culture than it has been in the past , and recreational fishing is more important , as some conchs now make their livings from charter fishing and other tourism - related businesses .
