Canto XXV Vanni hurls an obscenity at God and the serpents swarm over him . The centaur Cacus arrives to punish the wretch ; he has a fire - breathing dragon on his shoulders and snakes covering his equine back . ( In Roman mythology , Cacus , the monstrous , fire - breathing son of Vulcan , was killed by Hercules for raiding the hero 's cattle ; in Aeneid VIII , 193 -- 267 , Virgil did not describe him as a centaur ) . Dante then meets five noble thieves of Florence and observes their various transformations . Agnello Brunelleschi , in human form , is merged with the six - legged serpent that is Cianfa Donati . A figure named Buoso ( perhaps either Buoso degli Abati or Buoso Donati , the latter of whom is mentioned in Inf . XXX. 44 ) first appears as a man , but exchanges forms with Francesco de ' Cavalcanti , who bites Buoso in the form of a four - footed serpent . Puccio Sciancato remains unchanged for the time being .
