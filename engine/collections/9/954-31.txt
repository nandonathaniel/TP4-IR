The origins of the Little Red Riding Hood story can be traced to versions from various European countries and more than likely preceding the 17th century , of which several exist , some significantly different from the currently known , Grimms - inspired version . It was told by French peasants in the 10th century and recorded by the cathedral schoolmaster Egbert of Liege . In Italy , the Little Red Riding Hood was told by peasants in the fourteenth century , where a number of versions exist , including La finta nonna ( The False Grandmother ) , written among others by Italo Calvino in the Italian Folktales collection . It has also been called `` The Story of Grandmother '' . It is also possible that this early tale has roots in very similar East Asian tales ( e.g. `` Grandaunt Tiger '' ) .
