The unpainted stainless body creates challenges during restoration of the cars . In traditional automotive body repair , the panel is repaired to be as original ( `` straight '' ) as possible , and imperfections are sculpted back to form with body filler like Bondo or lead ( body solder ) . This poses no problem ( aside from originality ) with most cars , as the filler will be hidden by the car 's paint ( for example , most new cars have filler hiding the seam where the roof meets the quarter panel ) . With an unpainted stainless body , the stainless steel must be reworked to exactly the original shape , contour , and grain , which is a tremendously difficult job on regular steel ( a dented or bent panel is stretched , and a shrinking hammer or other techniques must be used to unstretch the metal ) and even more difficult with stainless due to its tendency to work - harden . Furthermore , it is exceedingly difficult to paint stainless steel due to difficulties with paint adhesion . DeLorean envisioned that damaged panels would simply be replaced rather than repaired ; each DeLorean service center today has at least one experienced body - repair person on staff , and there are decades worth of new stainless panels still available in most instances .
