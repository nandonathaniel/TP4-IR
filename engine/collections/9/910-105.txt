General Gage had anticipated that Lt. Col. Smith 's expedition might require reinforcement , so Gage drafted orders for reinforcing units to assemble in Boston at 4 a.m. But in his obsession for secrecy , Gage had sent only one copy of the orders to the adjutant of the 1st Brigade , whose servant then left the envelope on a table . Also at about 4 a.m. , the British column was within three miles of Lexington , and Lt. Col. Smith now had clear indication that all element of surprise had been lost and that alarm was spreading throughout the countryside . So he sent a rider back to Boston with a request for reinforcements . At about 5 a.m. , the rider reached Boston , and the 1st Brigade was ordered to assemble : the line infantry companies of the 4th , 23rd , and 47th Regiments , and a battalion of Royal Marines , under the command of Earl Percy . Unfortunately for the British , once again only one copy of the orders were sent to each commander , and the order for the Royal Marines was delivered to the desk of Major John Pitcairn , who was already on the Lexington Common with Smith 's column at that hour . After these delays , Percy 's brigade , about 1,000 strong , left Boston at about 8 : 45 a.m. , headed toward Lexington . Along the way , the story is told , they marched to the tune of `` Yankee Doodle '' to taunt the inhabitants of the area . By the Battle of Bunker Hill less than two months later , the song would become a popular anthem for the colonial forces .
