When looking to find examples of realism , there is a definite bias that comes into play . This is one that arises from a desire to prove realism is an always evident paradigm that can explain past and future occurrences . The problem becomes explaining how if realism is always at play , then why would Melos not have submitted . In my opinion , the most important uncertainty arising from the Peloponnesian War is why Melos took what actions it did . If this were an example of realism , Melos would have likely given in to the Athenians and saved themselves .
