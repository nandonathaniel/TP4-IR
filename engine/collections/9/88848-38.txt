In 1968 , a manufacturer took the risk of referring to their product this way , when Hewlett - Packard advertised their `` Powerful Computing Genie '' as `` The New Hewlett - Packard 9100A personal computer '' . This advertisement was deemed too extreme for the target audience and replaced with a much drier ad for the HP 9100A programmable calculator .
