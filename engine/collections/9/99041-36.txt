In 1981 , Drew Lewis , the first Transportation Secretary of the Reagan Administration , influenced by studies done by the auto industry , `` killed '' the previous administration 's mandate ; the decision was overruled in a federal appeals court the following year , and then by the Supreme Court . In 1984 , the Reagan Administration reversed its course , though in the meantime the original deadline had been extended ; Elizabeth Dole , then Transportation Secretary , proposed that the two passive safety restraints be phased into vehicles gradually , from vehicle model year 1987 to vehicle model year 1990 , when all vehicles would be required to have either automatic seat belts or driver side air bags . Though more awkward for vehicle occupants , most manufacturers opted to use less expensive automatic belts rather than airbags during this time period .
