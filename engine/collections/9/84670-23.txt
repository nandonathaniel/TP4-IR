First mapped by Spain in 1519 , Texas was part of the vast Spanish empire seized by the Spanish Conquistadors from its indigenous people for over 300 years . When the Louisiana territory was acquired by the United States from France in 1803 , many in the U.S. believed the new territory included parts or all of present - day Texas . The US - Spain border along the northern frontier of Texas took shape in the 1817 -- 1819 negotiations between Secretary of State John Quincy Adams and the Spanish ambassador to the United States , Luis de Onís y González - Vara . The boundaries of Texas were determined within the larger geostrategic struggle to demarcate the limits of the United States ' extensive western lands and of Spain 's vast possessions in North America . The Florida Treaty of February 22 , 1819 emerged as a compromise that excluded Spain from the lower Columbia River watershed , but established southern boundaries at the Sabine and Red Rivers , `` legally extinguish ( ing ) '' any American claims to Texas . Nonetheless , Texas remained an object of fervent interest to American expansionists , among them Thomas Jefferson , who anticipated the eventual acquisition of its fertile lands .
