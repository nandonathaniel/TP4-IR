Essentially there were two grades of suit , a smaller kind known as dike ( δίκη ) or private suit , and a larger kind known as graphe or public suit . For private suits the minimum jury size was 200 ( increased to 401 if a sum of over 1000 drachmas was at issue ) , for public suits 501 . Under Cleisthenes ' reforms , juries were selected by lot from a panel of 600 jurors , there being 600 jurors from each of the ten tribes of Athens , making a jury pool of 6000 in total . For particularly important public suits the jury could be increased by adding in extra allotments of 500 . 1000 and 1500 are regularly encountered as jury sizes and on at least one occasion , the first time a new kind of case was brought to court ( see graphē paranómōn ) , all 6,000 members of the jury pool may have attended to one case .
