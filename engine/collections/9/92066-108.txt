Once food leaves the crop , it passes to the midgut ( element 13 in numbered diagram ) , also known as the mesenteron , where the majority of digestion takes place . Microscopic projections from the midgut wall , called microvilli , increase the surface area of the wall and allow more nutrients to be absorbed ; they tend to be close to the origin of the midgut . In some insects , the role of the microvilli and where they are located may vary . For example , specialized microvilli producing digestive enzymes may more likely be near the end of the midgut , and absorption near the origin or beginning of the midgut .
