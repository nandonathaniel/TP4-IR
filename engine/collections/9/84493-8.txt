In his story `` Two Thousand Stiffs '' ( published in hardcover as part of the 1907 collection The Road ) , Jack London describes his experiences as a member of Kelly 's Army . The story gives a vivid account on a personal level of the motivations of the unemployed `` stiffs '' , the military style organization of their army , and the more and less willing support given them by more fortunate Americans who were still sympathetic to their cause . In London 's description , he joined Kelly 's Army at Council Bluffs , Iowa , and remained with it until its dissolution at the Mississippi River , a dissolution caused primarily by the inability to capture trains for transportation from an alerted railroad industry .
