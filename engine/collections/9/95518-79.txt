Community - Based Simple Network Management Protocol version 2 , or SNMPv2c , is defined in RFC 1901 -- RFC 1908 . SNMPv2c comprises SNMPv2 without the controversial new SNMP v2 security model , using instead the simple community - based security scheme of SNMPv1 . This version is one of relatively few standards to meet the IETF 's Draft Standard maturity level , and was widely considered the de facto SNMPv2 standard . It too was later obsoleted , by SNMPv3 .
