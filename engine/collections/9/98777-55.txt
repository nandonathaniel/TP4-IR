Article 7 prohibits the retroactive criminalisation of acts and omissions . No person may be punished for an act that was not a criminal offence at the time of its commission . The article states that a criminal offence is one under either national or international law , which would permit a party to prosecute someone for a crime which was not illegal under domestic law at the time , so long as it was prohibited by international law . The Article also prohibits a heavier penalty being imposed than was applicable at the time when the criminal act was committed .
