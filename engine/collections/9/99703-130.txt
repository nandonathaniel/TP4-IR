The Church of Scotland ( or Kirk ) is the largest religious denomination in Scotland , however , unlike the Church of England it is Presbyterian and ( since 1921 ) not a branch of the state , with the Sovereign holding no formal role in the Church other than being an ordinary member . However , though the Kirk is disestablished , Scotland is not a secular polity . The Kirk remains a national church to which the state has special obligations ; it is conventional that the monarch , who is head of state , must attend the Church when she visits Scotland , and they swear in their accession oath to maintain and preserve the church . The state also gives numerous preferences to the Church of Scotland and Catholic Church , particularly in education . The blasphemy law has not been abolished in Scotland , though it has fallen into disuse . Non-religious couples can have a civil wedding with no religious elements , and humanist weddings have been legally recognised since 2005 , and enshrined in Scottish law since 2017 . Collective worship makes prayer and worship of a Christian character mandatory in all schools , but parents can remove their children from these lessons , though sixth formers have no right to opt out .
