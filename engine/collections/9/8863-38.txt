The group 's big break arrived when their second album , Toxicity , debuted at No. 1 on the American and Canadian charts , despite the events of September 11 . The album has eventually achieved 3x multi-platinum certification in the US and has since sold over 12 million copies worldwide . It was still on top in America during the week of the September 11 , 2001 attacks and the political environment caused by the attacks added to the controversy surrounding the album 's hit single `` Chop Suey ! '' The song was taken off the radio as it contained politically sensitive lyrics according to the 2001 Clear Channel memorandum at the time such as `` ( I do n't think you ) trust in my self - righteous suicide . '' Regardless , the video gained constant play on MTV as did the album 's second single , `` Toxicity '' . Even with the controversy surrounding `` Chop Suey ! '' ( which earned a Grammy nomination ) , System of a Down still received constant airplay in the United States throughout late 2001 and 2002 with `` Toxicity '' and `` Aerials '' . In May 2006 , VH1 listed `` Toxicity '' in the number 14 slot in the 40 Greatest Metal Songs .
