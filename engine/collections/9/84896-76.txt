Some observers thought Schumacher , a gay man , added possible homoerotic innuendo in the storyline . James Berardinelli questioned the `` random amount ( sic ) of rubber nipples and camera angle close - ups of the Dynamic Duo 's butts and Bat - crotches . '' Similar to Batman Forever , this primarily included the decision to add nipples and enlarged codpieces to Batman and Robin suits . Schumacher stated , `` I had no idea that putting nipples on the Batsuit and Robin suit were going to spark international headlines . The bodies of the suits come from ancient Greek statues , which display perfect bodies . They are anatomically correct . '' Chris O'Donnell , who portrayed Robin , felt `` it was n't so much the nipples that bothered me . It was the codpiece . The press obviously played it up and made it a big deal , especially with Joel directing . I did n't think twice about the controversy , but going back and looking and seeing some of the pictures , it was very unusual . '' George Clooney joked , `` Joel Schumacher told me we never made another Batman film because Batman was gay '' . Clooney himself has spoken critically of the film , saying , `` I think we might have killed the franchise '' , and called it `` a waste of money '' .
