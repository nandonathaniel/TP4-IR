Receiving the sacrament of penance from a priest is distinct from receiving pastoral counseling or psychotherapy ( without confession of absolution ) from a priest -- even if that priest is one 's spiritual director or a member of the pastoral team of one 's parish . The hierarchy of the Catholic Church have insisted on this point in order to avoid confusion , as both confidential processes have distinct roles in church life .
