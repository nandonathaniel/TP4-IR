The miniseries expands upon the Hitchhiker 's character , revealing that he owns a pet dog named Sparky ( whom he killed by shooting in the head and treats as if it were still alive ) and that he creates furniture and sculptures out of corpses . The miniseries also showed the extent of the Hitchhiker 's abuse of Leatherface whom the Hitchhiker constantly bullies for little or no reason ( although he apparently respects Leatherface 's prowess at frightening and killing people , as he laments to Jason ) . The comics also hint that the Hitchhiker , as well as Leatherface , were born of incest , with Drayton 's younger sister Velma being implicated as being their sister and mother . The Hitchhiker is also seen driving a tow truck and working at the family gas station , where he sabotages motorists ' automobiles . He then informs his family and they attack the newly stranded people . The Hitchhiker 's bizarre birth mark also changes shape several times throughout the comics , at one point it takes the form of a swastika and a lightning bolt . After `` killing '' Jason , the Hitchhiker 's brother Drayton ( called Cook Slaughter in the comics ) implicates that the Hitchhiker killed his own cousin named Emery with a two - by - four after a losing a game of checkers , to which the hitchhiker replies `` He should n't have laughed at me '' .
