The high degree of uniformity throughout the observable universe and its faint but measured anisotropy lend strong support for the Big Bang model in general and the Î›CDM ( `` Lambda Cold Dark Matter '' ) model in particular . Moreover , the fluctuations are coherent on angular scales that are larger than the apparent cosmological horizon at recombination . Either such coherence is acausally fine - tuned , or cosmic inflation occurred .
