When Ghazan took the throne of the Ilkhanate in 1295 , he formally accepted Islam as his own religion , marking a turning point in Mongol history after which Mongol Persia became more and more Islamic . Despite this , Ghazan continued to strengthen ties with Temür Khan and the Yuan dynasty in the east . It was politically useful to advertise the great khan 's authority in the Ilkhanate , because the Golden Horde in Russia had long made claims on nearby Georgia . Within four years , Ghazan began sending tribute to the Yuan court and appealing to other khans to accept Temür Khan as their overlord . He oversaw an extensive program of cultural and scientific interaction between the Ilkhanate and the Yuan dynasty in the following decades .
