The war has been the subject of large protests around the world starting with the large - scale demonstrations in the days leading up to the invasion and every year since . Many protesters consider the bombing and invasion of Afghanistan to be unjustified aggression . The deaths of Afghan civilians caused directly and indirectly by the U.S. and NATO bombing campaigns is a major underlying focus of the protests . In January 2009 , Brave New Foundation launched Rethink Afghanistan , a national campaign for non-violent solutions in Afghanistan built around a documentary film by director and political activist Robert Greenwald . Dozens of organizations planned ( and eventually held ) a national march for peace in Washington , D.C. on March 20 , 2010 .
