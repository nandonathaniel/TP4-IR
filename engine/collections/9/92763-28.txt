Although General Motors introduced its first pickup truck in 1930 , the term `` Silverado '' was a designation used only to detail the trim for the Chevrolet C / K pickup trucks , Suburbans , and Tahoes from 1975 through 1999 . GMC used a few variations of the `` Sierra '' name ( e.g. Sierra , Sierra Classic , and High Sierra ) ; however , Chevrolet still uses the CK and the CC in their current model codes .
