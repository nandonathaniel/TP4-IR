For the sequel , Mane , McDowell , Taylor - Compton , Harris , Moon Zombie , and Dourif returned to the roles of Michael Myers , Dr. Loomis , Laurie Strode , Annie Brackett , Deborah Myers , and Sheriff Brackett , respectively . Daeg Faerch , who portrayed a young Michael Myers in the 2007 remake , was set to reprise his role for Halloween II . By the time production was getting started for the sequel Faerch had grown too big for the part . Zombie had to recast the role , much to his own dismay , because Faerch 's physical maturity did not fit what was in the script . Although Faerch is not in the sequel , the first trailer for Halloween II contained images of Faerch . Zombie pointed out that those images were test shots done and were not intended to be in either the trailer or the film .
