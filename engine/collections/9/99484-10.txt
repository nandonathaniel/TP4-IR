According to Tacitus , Nero was away from Rome , in Antium , when the fire broke out . He returned to the city and took measures to bring in food supplies and open gardens and public buildings to accommodate refugees . After six days the organized clearing of built - up areas brought the conflagration to a halt before it reached the Esquiline Hill . There was a further outbreak in the Aemilian district , involving the destruction of temples and arcades but less loss of life . However the fire was now under control . Of Rome 's 14 districts , 3 were completely devastated and only 4 completely escaped damage .
