The kidneys measure the oxygen content rather than the partial pressure of oxygen in the arterial blood . When the oxygen content of the blood is chronically low , oxygen - sensitive cells secrete erythropoietin ( EPO ) into the blood . The effector tissue is the red bone marrow which produces red blood cells ( RBCs ) ( erythrocytes ) . The increase in RBCs leads to an increased hematocrit in the blood , and subsequent increase in hemoglobin that increases the oxygen carrying capacity . This is the mechanism whereby high altitude dwellers have higher hematocrits than sea - level residents , and also why persons with pulmonary insufficiency or right - to - left shunts in the heart ( through which venous blood by - passes the lungs and goes directly into the systemic circulation ) have similarly high hematocrits .
