The term `` Prime Minister '' can be compared to `` primary minister '' or `` first minister '' . Because of this , the Prime Ministers of many countries are traditionally considered to be `` first among equals '' -- they are the chairman or `` head '' of a Cabinet rather than holding an office that is de jure superior to that of ministers .
