In the fourth century , Arius , as traditionally understood , taught that the Father existed prior to the Son who was not , by nature , God but rather a changeable creature who was granted the dignity of becoming `` Son of God '' . In 325 , the Council of Nicaea adopted the Nicene Creed which described Christ as `` God of God , Light of Light , very God of very God , begotten , not made , being of one substance with the Father '' . The creed used the term homoousios ( of one substance ) to define the relationship between the Father and the Son . After more than fifty years of debate , homoousios was recognised as the hallmark of orthodoxy , and was further developed into the formula of `` three persons , one being '' .
