Assault weapon law ? Yes Yes A two point `` banned features '' system is what defines an assault weapon . These assault weapons are prohibited unless lawfully owned on or prior to September 13 , 1994 . Firearms that do not have two or more `` banned features '' are legal to purchase with an LTC or in some cases a standard FID so long as magazine restrictions are followed to what your license allows .
