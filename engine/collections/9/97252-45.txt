According to Thomas O'Loughlin , `` Each monastery should be seen , as with most monasteries of the period , as an individual response to the monastic impulse by someone who had experienced monasticism and then went off to establish either a hermitage to which others later came or a cenobitic community . '' The monasteries were organized on a family basis . Next in importance to the abbot was the scribe , in charge of the scriptorium , the teaching function of the monastery , and the keeping of the annals . The role of scribe was often a path to the position of abbot . Hereditary right and relationship to the abbot were factors influencing appointment to monastic offices .
