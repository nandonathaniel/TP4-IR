The Democratic Party dominated the House of Representatives during the administration of President Franklin D. Roosevelt ( 1933 -- 1945 ) , often winning over two - thirds of the seats . Both Democrats and Republicans were in power at various times during the next decade . The Democratic Party maintained control of the House from 1955 until 1995 . In the mid-1970s , there were major reforms of the House , strengthening the power of sub-committees at the expense of committee chairs and allowing party leaders to nominate committee chairs . These actions were taken to undermine the seniority system , and to reduce the ability of a small number of senior members to obstruct legislation they did not favor . There was also a shift from the 1990s to greater control of the legislative program by the majority party ; the power of party leaders ( especially the Speaker ) grew considerably .
