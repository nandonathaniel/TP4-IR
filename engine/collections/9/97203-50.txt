The French developer of Piou Piou vs. Cactus , known as Kek , told Pocket Gamer that he , too , noticed that Flappy Bird is `` very similar '' to his earlier game , but when he contacted Nguyen about it , Nguyen claimed that he did not know anything . Technology editor Patrick O'Rourke of Canada.com also charged that Flappy Bird is `` almost a complete ripoff '' of Piou Piou vs Cactus , as well as that its primary gameplay mechanic is a `` rip off '' from a game called Helicopter Game , and that it heavily borrowed sound effects from Super Mario Bros. games .
