The casting of Affleck , Gadot , and Eisenberg was criticized . Affleck 's casting caused significant backlash from comic book fans , with multiple online petitions demanding his removal from the role ; unlike previous Batman actors , he was not considered intimidating enough for the role by the protesters . Conversely , PopMatters journalist J.C. Ma√ßek III supported Affleck 's casting as Batman , stating , `` Way back when the news was new I wrote a PopMatters article defending the choice of Ben Affleck as Batman . I 'll let that one speak for itself . '' Via social media , fans criticized Gadot 's small frame in contrast to Wonder Woman 's warrior - like build in the comics . Responding to this , Gadot stated that she had been participating in various training regimens to achieve a body that stays closer to the source material . Fans also criticized Eisenberg 's casting , feeling that the then - 30 - year - old was too young for the role , and not physically imposing enough . Upon the film 's release , both Affleck and Gadot received considerable praise for their performances , despite the overall negative reception of the film itself .
