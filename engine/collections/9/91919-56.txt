I think that there has been a tendency in the Middle East field to adopt the word `` orientalism '' as a generalized swear - word , essentially referring to people who take the `` wrong '' position on the Arab -- Israeli dispute , or to people who are judged too `` conservative '' . It has nothing to do with whether they are good or not good in their disciplines . So , `` orientalism '' , for many people , is a word that substitutes for thought and enables people to dismiss certain scholars and their works . I think that is too bad . It may not have been what Edward Said meant at all , but the term has become a kind of slogan .
