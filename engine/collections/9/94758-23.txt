In British English , `` lady '' is often , but not always , simply a courteous synonym for `` woman '' . It has a formal and respectful quality , being used to describe a woman in old age such as `` an old lady '' or when speaking about a woman to a child ( e.g. `` Give the money to the lady . '' ) It may be used , however incongruously , in descriptions such as `` the cleaning lady '' or even `` a bag lady '' ( tramp ) . Public toilets are often distinguished by signs showing simply `` Ladies '' or `` Gentlemen '' .
