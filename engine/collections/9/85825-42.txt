A germ cell is any biological cell that gives rise to the gametes of an organism that reproduces sexually . In many animals , the germ cells originate in the primitive streak and migrate via the gut of an embryo to the developing gonads . There , they undergo meiosis , followed by cellular differentiation into mature gametes , either eggs or sperm . Unlike animals , plants do not have germ cells designated in early development . Instead , germ cells can arise from somatic cells in the adult ( such as the floral meristem of flowering plants ) .
