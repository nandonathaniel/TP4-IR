Christians generally have the view that the New Covenant supersedes ( i.e. , replaces ) the Old Testament 's ritual laws , which includes many of the rules in Leviticus . Christians therefore have usually not observed Leviticus ' rules regarding diet , purity , and agriculture . Christian teachings have differed , however , as to where to draw the line between ritual and moral regulations .
