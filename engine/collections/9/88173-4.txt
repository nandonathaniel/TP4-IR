Irradiation is used to reduce or eliminate the risk of food bourne illnesses , prevent or slow down spoilage , arrest maturation or sprouting and as a treatment against pests . Depending on the dose , some or all of the pathogenic organisms , microorganisms , bacteria , and viruses present are destroyed , slowed down , or rendered incapable of reproduction . Irradiation can not revert spoiled or over ripened food to a fresh state . If this food was processed by irradiation , further spoilage would cease and ripening would slow down , yet the irradiation would not destroy the toxins or repair the texture , color , or taste of the food . When targeting bacteria , most foods are irradiated to significantly reduce the number of active microbes , not to sterilize all microbes in the product . In this respect it is similar to pasteurization .
