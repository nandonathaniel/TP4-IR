Hector 's adventures in the name of King Arthur were many and wide - ranging . With Sir Morganore , it was Hector de Maris who welcomed Sir Tristan to Camelot when he was shipwrecked nearby . The two jousted in a friendly competition , but Hector was ashamed to have been beaten by a knight of Cornwall . Other times he was more successful at tournaments , getting the better of both Sir Palomides and Sir Percivale . He , however , failed to defeat Sir Turquine and became one of the knights he imprisoned before being rescued by his brother , Sir Lancelot . He returned the favour by rediscovering the lost Knight of the Lake after his period of insanity and returning him to the court . He is known to have had a long relationship with Lady Perse of the Narrow Borderland , whose fianc√© he murdered in order to be with her . Hector later had an affair with the cousin of the Lady of Roestoc , before being reunited with Perse .
