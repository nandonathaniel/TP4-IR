Yet , with Revelation , the problems might be judged more fundamental . The author seems to be using his sources in a completely different way to the originals . For example , he borrows the ' new temple ' imagery of Ezekiel 40 -- 48 but uses it to describe a New Jerusalem which , quite pointedly , no longer needs a temple because it is God 's dwelling . Ian Boxall writes that Revelation `` is no montage of biblical quotations ( that is not John 's way ) but a wealth of allusions and evocations rewoven into something new and creative . '' In trying to identify this `` something new '' , Boxall argues that Ezekiel provides the ' backbone ' for Revelation . He sets out a comparative table listing the chapters of Revelation in sequence and linking most of them to the structurally corresponding chapter in Ezekiel . The interesting point is that the order is not the same . John , on this theory , rearranges Ezekiel to suit his own purposes .
