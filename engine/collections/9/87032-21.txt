At the heart of Sir Gawain and the Green Knight is the test of Gawain 's adherence to the code of chivalry . The typical temptation fable of medieval literature presents a series of tribulations assembled as tests or `` proofs '' of moral virtue . The stories often describe several individuals ' failures after which the main character is tested . Success in the proofs will often bring immunity or good fortune . Gawain 's ability to pass the tests of his host are of utmost importance to his survival , though he does not know it . It is only by fortuity or `` instinctive - courtesy '' that Sir Gawain is able to pass his test . There are also hints in the poem that it is really Bertilak who is testing Gawain .
