Some more localized phenomena than global atmospheric movement are also due to convection , including wind and some of the hydrologic cycle . For example , a foehn wind is a down - slope wind which occurs on the downwind side of a mountain range . It results from the adiabatic warming of air which has dropped most of its moisture on windward slopes . Because of the different adiabatic lapse rates of moist and dry air , the air on the leeward slopes becomes warmer than at the same height on the windward slopes .
