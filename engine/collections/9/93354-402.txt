This was the second playoff meeting between these two teams ; their only previous series was in the 2012 Eastern Conference Quarterfinals , which New York won in seven games . This was the second time under the current playoff format and the second year in a row in which a wild - card team had more points than its opponent during the regular season but did not have home ice advantage ; the other time was the Tampa Bay Lightning and the New York Islanders in last year 's Eastern Conference Second Round . Ottawa won two of the three games in this year 's regular season series .
