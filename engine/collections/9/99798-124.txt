The `` Crimestopper 's Textbook '' was parodied in two editions of The Stan Freberg Show in 1957 , both in a discussion sketch called `` Face the Funnies . '' In the first , a self - proclaimed Dick Tracy expert ( voiced by Daws Butler ) advised , `` If vandals kidnap you , look for fingerprints on or about your person . '' In the second example , Butler said , `` If someone shoots you in the chest , extract the bullet and look for small tell - tale bore markings on the slug , and then call a doctor . ''
