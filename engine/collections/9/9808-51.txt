Nearly a century ago , the north flank of Mount Bandai collapsed during an eruption quite similar to the May 18 , 1980 , eruption of Mount St. Helens . After a week of seismic activity , a large earthquake on July 15 , 1888 , was followed by a tremendous noise and a large explosion . Eyewitnesses heard about 15 to 20 additional explosions and observed that the last one was projected almost horizontally to the north .
