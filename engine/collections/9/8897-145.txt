Flaxseed ( or linseed ) ( Linum usitatissimum ) and its oil are perhaps the most widely available botanical source of the omega − 3 fatty acid ALA . Flaxseed oil consists of approximately 55 % ALA , which makes it six times richer than most fish oils in omega − 3 fatty acids . A portion of this is converted by the body to EPA and DHA , though the actual converted percentage may differ between men and women .
