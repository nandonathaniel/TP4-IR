System software can use the TPR register to temporarily block low - priority interrupts from interrupting a high - priority task . This is accomplished by loading TPR with a value corresponding to the highest - priority interrupt that is to be blocked . For example , loading TPR with a value of 9 ( 1001b ) blocks all interrupts with a priority class of 9 or less , while allowing all interrupts with a priority class of 10 or more to be recognized . Loading TPR with 0 enables all external interrupts . Loading TPR with 15 ( 1111b ) disables all external interrupts .
