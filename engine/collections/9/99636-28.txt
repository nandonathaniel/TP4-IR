However , early records of kimchi do not mention garlic or chili pepper . Chili peppers , now a standard ingredient in kimchi , had been unknown in Korea until the early seventeenth century . Chili peppers originated in the Americas , introduced to East Asia by Portuguese traders . The first mention of chili pepper is found in Jibong yuseol , an encyclopedia published in 1614 . Sallim gyeongje , a 17 â€’ 18th century book on farm management , wrote on kimchi with chili peppers . However , it was not until the 19th century that the use of chili peppers in kimchi was widespread . The recipes from early 19th century closely resemble today 's kimchi .
