The word βιβλίον itself had the literal meaning of `` paper '' or `` scroll '' and came to be used as the ordinary word for `` book '' . It is the diminutive of βύβλος byblos , `` Egyptian papyrus '' , possibly so called from the name of the Phoenician sea port Byblos ( also known as Gebal ) from whence Egyptian papyrus was exported to Greece . The Greek ta biblia ( lit . `` little papyrus books '' ) was `` an expression Hellenistic Jews used to describe their sacred books ( the Septuagint ) . Christian use of the term can be traced to c. 223 CE . The biblical scholar F.F. Bruce notes that Chrysostom appears to be the first writer ( in his Homilies on Matthew , delivered between 386 and 388 ) to use the Greek phrase ta biblia ( '' the books `` ) to describe both the Old and New Testaments together .
