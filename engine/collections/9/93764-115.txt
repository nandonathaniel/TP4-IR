In the iPhone 7 , Apple added a software lock that prevents individuals from attempting to replace the home button on their own . Users are now required to go to an Apple Store to have repairs done , with `` recalibration '' of the button being necessary . This is a step further than Apple went with iPhone 5S , 6 and 6S , where only Touch ID functionality would get disabled but the `` return - to - home '' functionality still worked .
