The German army opened the war on the Western Front with a modified version of the Schlieffen Plan , designed to quickly attack France through neutral Belgium before turning southwards to encircle the French army on the German border . The Belgians fought back , and sabotaged their rail system to delay the Germans . The Germans did not expect this and were delayed , and responded with systematic reprisals on civilians , killing nearly 6,000 Belgian noncombatants , including women and children , and burning 25,000 houses and buildings . The plan called for the right flank of the German advance to converge on Paris and initially , the Germans were very successful , particularly in the Battle of the Frontiers ( 14 -- 24 August ) . By 12 September , the French with assistance from the British forces halted the German advance east of Paris at the First Battle of the Marne ( 5 -- 12 September ) . The last days of this battle signified the end of mobile warfare in the west . The French offensive into Germany launched on 7 August with the Battle of Mulhouse had limited success .
