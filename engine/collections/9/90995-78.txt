Nina Auerbach discusses how the novel revolves around eating and drinking , which `` motivates much of ( Alice 's ) behaviour '' , for the story is essentially about things `` entering and leaving her mouth '' . The animals of Wonderland are of particular interest , for Alice 's relation to them shifts constantly because , as Lovell - Smith states , Alice 's size - changes continually reposition her in the food chain , serving as a way to make her acutely aware of the `` eat or be eaten '' attitude that permeates Wonderland .
