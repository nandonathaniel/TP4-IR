Alongside complaints of unsuitable auditions , the seventh series also generated complaints from viewers over the auditions by two child participants - Arisxandra Libantino , and Asanda - in regards to both conducting performances that were considered inappropriate for their age . In both cases of criticism , the complaints were over the song 's that they performed - Libantino 's performance involved singing Jennifer Hudson 's `` One Night Only '' , while Asanda 's invlved the singing of Rihanna 's `` Diamonds '' and performing provocative dancing . The director of Mediawatch UK , Vivienne Pattison , criticised the show for `` sexualising children '' based on these auditions .
