The maximum surveyed depth of the Challenger Deep was reported in 1957 by the Soviet Research vessel Vityaz recording a spot 11,034 metres ( 36,201 ft ) ± 50 m ( 164 ft ) deep at 11 ° 20.9 ′ N 142 ° 11.5 ′ E ﻿ / ﻿ 11.3483 ° N 142.1917 ° E ﻿ / 11.3483 ; 142.1917 . It was dubbed the Mariana Hollow and is listed in many reference sources , including the Encyclopædia Britannica , articles in National Geographic and on maps . The pressure at this depth is approximately 1,099 times that at the surface , or 111 MPa ( 16,099 psi ) . In 1959 , the US Navy research vessel RV Stranger using bomb - sounding surveyed a maximum depth of 10,915 m ( 35,810 ft ) ± 10 m ( 33 ft ) at 11 ° 20.0 ′ N 142 ° 11.8 ′ E ﻿ / ﻿ 11.3333 ° N 142.1967 ° E ﻿ / 11.3333 ; 142.1967 . In 1962 , the US Navy research vessel RV Spencer F. Baird using a frequency - controlled depth recorder surveyed a maximum depth of 10,915 m ( 35,810 ft ) ± 10 m ( 33 ft ) at 11 ° 20.0 ′ N 142 ° 11.8 ′ E ﻿ / ﻿ 11.3333 ° N 142.1967 ° E ﻿ / 11.3333 ; 142.1967 . In 1975 and 1980 , the US Navy research vessel RV Thomas Washington using a precision depth recorder with satellite positioning surveyed a maximum depth of 10,915 m ( 35,810 ft ) ± 10 m ( 33 ft ) at 11 ° 20.0 ′ N 142 ° 11.8 ′ E ﻿ / ﻿ 11.3333 ° N 142.1967 ° E ﻿ / 11.3333 ; 142.1967 . In 1984 , the survey vessel Takuyo from the Hydrographic Department of Japan , used a narrow , multibeam echo sounder to take a measurement of 10,924 m ( 35,840 ft ) ± 10 m ( 33 ft ) at 11 ° 22.4 ′ N 142 ° 35.5 ′ E ﻿ / ﻿ 11.3733 ° N 142.5917 ° E ﻿ / 11.3733 ; 142.5917 .
