Sheriff Little had a tendency to punch and kick fenders and doors off of cars he wrecked , in anger . He was also not afraid to pull out his trusty 12 - gauge shotgun and open fire . He is also a Left hander Police officer , The ill - tempered sheriff hated Bo , Luke , Daisy , Coy , Vance , Uncle Jesse , Cooter , Enos and Cletus immensely and they were well aware that Bo and Luke were not allowed to enter his county . Sheriff Little was constantly irritated by the bumbling performance of Rosco and the crookedness of Hogg , although he thought highly of Enos ; Little was strict , by - the - book , and a competent law officer , everything that Sheriff Rosco was not ( although he too had little luck in capturing Bo and Luke ) . He had a wife named Rachel and also a daughter . Before Sheriff Little was introduced , in the third - season episode `` My Son , Bo Hogg '' , several first and second - season episodes saw several similar tough - as - nails Sheriffs from adjoining counties .
