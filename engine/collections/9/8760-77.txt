The Empire State Building was officially opened on May 1 , 1931 , in dramatic fashion , when United States President Herbert Hoover turned on the building 's lights with the push of a button from Washington , D.C. . The tower had been completed forty - five days earlier than its projected opening . Jimmy Walker , Governor Franklin D. Roosevelt , and Al Smith were also in attendance . After the ceremonial button pressing , they and about 350 other guests proceeded to attend a luncheon on the 86th floor . An account from that day stated that the view from the luncheon was obscured by a fog , with other landmarks such as the Statue of Liberty being `` lost in the mist '' . The building officially opened the next day . Advertisements for the observatories were placed in local newspapers , while nearby hotels also released ads that lauded their proximity to the newly opened tower .
