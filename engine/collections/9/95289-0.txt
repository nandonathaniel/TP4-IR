Egyptian temples were built for the official worship of the gods and in commemoration of the pharaohs in ancient Egypt and regions under Egyptian control . Temples were seen as houses for the gods or kings to whom they were dedicated . Within them , the Egyptians performed a variety of rituals , the central functions of Egyptian religion : giving offerings to the gods , reenacting their mythological interactions through festivals , and warding off the forces of chaos . These rituals were seen as necessary for the gods to continue to uphold maat , the divine order of the universe . Housing and caring for the gods were the obligations of pharaohs , who therefore dedicated prodigious resources to temple construction and maintenance . Out of necessity , pharaohs delegated most of their ritual duties to a host of priests , but most of the populace was excluded from direct participation in ceremonies and forbidden to enter a temple 's most sacred areas . Nevertheless , a temple was an important religious site for all classes of Egyptians , who went there to pray , give offerings , and seek oracular guidance from the god dwelling within .
