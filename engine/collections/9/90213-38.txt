Between 1946 and 1971 , the Chinese seat on the Security Council was the government of the Republic of China ( that retreated to Taiwan in 1949 ) during which time its representative used the veto only once , to block Mongolia 's application for membership in 1955 , because the ROC considered the country to be a part of China . This postponed the admission of Mongolia until 1961 , when the Soviet Union announced that unless Mongolia was admitted , it would block the admission of all of the newly independent African states . Faced with this pressure , the ROC relented under protest .
