Following this declaration , the Federal Parliament is automatically dissolved and a new federal election must take place . This makes it impossible to amend the Constitution unless an election has intervened . Following the election , the new Federal Parliament can amend those articles that have been declared revisable . Neither Chamber can consider amendments to the Constitution unless at least two - thirds of its members are present and the Constitution can only be amended if at least two - thirds of the votes cast are in favour of the amendment .
