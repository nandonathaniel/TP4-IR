Following the British defeat at Saratoga , and the entry of France into the war , Henry Clinton withdrew from Philadelphia , consolidating in New York . French admiral the Comte d'Estaing had been dispatched to North America in April 1778 to assist Washington , arriving shortly after Clinton withdrew into New York . Concluding New York 's defences were too formidable for the French fleet , the Franco - American forces opted to attack Newport . This effort , launched on August 29 , failed after the French opted to withdraw , greatly angering the Americans . The war then ground down to a stalemate , with the majority of actions fought as large skirmishes , such as those at Chestnut Neck and Little Egg Harbor . In the summer of 1779 , the Americans captured British posts at Stony Point and Paulus Hook .
