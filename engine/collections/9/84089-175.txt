CRISPR / Cas - based `` RNA - guided nucleases '' can be used to target virulence factors , genes encoding antibiotic resistance and other medically relevant sequences of interest . This technology thus represents a novel form of antimicrobial therapy and a strategy by which to manipulate bacterial populations . Recent studies suggested a correlation between the interfering of the CRISPR / Cas locus and acquisition of antibiotic resistance This system provides protection of bacteria against invading foreign DNA , such as transposons , bacteriophages and plasmids . This system was shown to be a strong selective pressure for the acquisition of antibiotic resistance and virulence factor in bacterial pathogens . Some of the affected genes are tied to human diseases , including those involved in muscle differentiation , cancer , inflammation and fetal hemoglobin .
