Use of the Regent 's prayer was initially upheld in both New York State Court and in the New York Court of Appeals , prompting Engels to petition the US Supreme Court in the Engel v. Vitale case in 1962 . With its 8 -- 1 vote to make public recitation of the Regents ' Prayer in public schools unlawful , the U.S. Supreme Court made its first - ever decision on prayer in public schools . It made its second in 1963 -- the Abington School District v. Schempp ruling , which made the corporate reading of the Bible and recitation of the Lord 's Prayer unlawful in public schools .
