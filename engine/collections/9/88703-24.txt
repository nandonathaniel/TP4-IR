The first line opened without ceremony on 19 July 1900 , during the World 's Fair ( Exposition Universelle ) . The system expanded quickly until the First World War and the core was complete by the 1920s . Extensions into suburbs and Line 11 were built in the 1930s . The network reached saturation after World War II with new trains to allow higher traffic , but further improvements have been limited by the design of the network and in particular the short distances between stations . Besides the MÃ©tro , downtown Paris and its urban area are served by the RER developed from the 1960s , several tramway lines , Transilien suburban trains and two VAL lines , serving Charles De Gaulle and Orly airports . In the late 1990s , the automated line 14 was built to relieve RER line A .
