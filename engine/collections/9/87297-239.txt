Jewelry design . In 2015 / 16 , the Asia Society in New York presented an exhibit called Philippine Gold : Treasures of Forgotten Kingdoms . The exhibition presents spectacular works of gold primarily discovered over the past forty years on the Philippine islands of Luzon , the Visayas , and Mindanao . The regalia , jewelry , ceremonial weapons , and ritualistic and funerary objects attest to the recently uncovered evidence of prosperity and achievement of Philippine polities that flourished between the tenth and thirteenth centuries , long before the Spanish discovered and colonized the region . Although the forms and styles of the majority of these works developed locally , some indicate that Philippine craftsmen had been exposed to objects from beyond their borders through the robust cultural connections and maritime trade in Southeast Asia during what was an early Asian economic boom .
