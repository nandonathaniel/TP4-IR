Tropical cyclones form in any month of the year across the northwest Pacific Ocean , and concentrate around June and November in the northern Indian Ocean . The area just northeast of the Philippines is the most active place on Earth for tropical cyclones to exist . Across the Philippines themselves , activity reaches a minimum in February , before increasing steadily through June , and spiking from July through October , with September being the most active month for tropical cyclones across the archipelago . Activity falls off significantly in November . The most active season , since 1945 , for tropical cyclone strikes on the island archipelago was 1993 when nineteen tropical cyclones moved through the country . There was only one tropical cyclone which moved through the Philippines in 1958 . The most frequently impacted areas of the Philippines by tropical cyclones are northern Luzon and eastern Visayas . A ten - year average of satellite determined precipitation showed that at least 30 percent of the annual rainfall in the northern Philippines could be traced to tropical cyclones , while the southern islands receive less than 10 percent of their annual rainfall from tropical cyclones .
