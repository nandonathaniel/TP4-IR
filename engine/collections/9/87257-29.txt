Writing for Rolling Stone in 2002 , Mikal Gilmore likened `` Here Comes the Sun '' to the McCartney - written `` Let It Be '' and Lennon 's `` Imagine '' , as Harrison 's `` graceful anthem of hope amid difficult realities '' . While expressing regret at having underestimated Harrison as a songwriter , Martin described `` Here Comes the Sun '' as being `` in some ways one of the best songs ever written '' .
