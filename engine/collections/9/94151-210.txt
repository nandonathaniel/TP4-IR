Gladiators were trained combatants who might be slaves , convicts , or free volunteers . Death was not a necessary or even desirable outcome in matches between these highly skilled fighters , whose training represented a costly and time - consuming investment . By contrast , noxii were convicts sentenced to the arena with little or no training , often unarmed , and with no expectation of survival . Physical suffering and humiliation were considered appropriate retributive justice for the crimes they had committed . These executions were sometimes staged or ritualized as re-enactments of myths , and amphitheatres were equipped with elaborate stage machinery to create special effects . Tertullian considered deaths in the arena to be nothing more than a dressed - up form of human sacrifice .
