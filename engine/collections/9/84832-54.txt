The ECG may include a rhythm analysis algorithm that produces a computerized interpretation of the ECG . The results from these algorithms are considered `` preliminary '' until verified and / or modified by someone trained in interpreting ECGs . Included in this analysis is computation of common parameters that include PR interval , QT interval , corrected QT ( QTc ) interval , PR axis , QRS axis , and more . Earlier designs recorded each lead sequentially but current designs employ circuits that can record all leads simultaneously . The former introduces problems in interpretation since there may be beat - to - beat changes in the rhythm , which makes it unwise to compare across beats .
