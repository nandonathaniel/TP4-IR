According to Snape , the Dark Arts `` are many , varied , ever - changing and eternal ... unfixed , mutating , indestructible '' . In magical dueling , there are any number of spells that may be used to attack , immobilise , or disarm an opponent without causing pain or lasting harm ; however , spells such as the Cruciatus Curse or Sectumsempra , judged to be Dark by reliable authorities , wound or seriously distress a victim in some way . Dark spells can be classified into three groups : jinxes , hexes & curses .
