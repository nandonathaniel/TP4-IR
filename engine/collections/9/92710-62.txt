Christian prayers are quite varied . They can be completely spontaneous , or read entirely from a text , like the Anglican Book of Common Prayer . The most common prayer among Christians is the Lord 's Prayer , which according to the gospel accounts ( e.g. Matthew 6 : 9 -- 13 ) is how Jesus taught his disciples to pray . The Lord 's Prayer is a model for prayers of adoration , confession and petition in Christianity . In medieval England , prayers ( particularly the paternoster ) were frequently used as a measure of time in medical and culinary recipe books .
