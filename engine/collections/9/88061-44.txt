The first popular music performance of the anthem heard by the mainstream U.S. was by Puerto Rican singer and guitarist Jos√© Feliciano . He created a nationwide uproar when he strummed a slow , blues - style rendition of the song at Tiger Stadium in Detroit before game five of the 1968 World Series , between Detroit and St. Louis . This rendition started contemporary `` Star - Spangled Banner '' controversies . The response from many in the Vietnam War - era U.S. was generally negative . Despite the controversy , Feliciano 's performance opened the door for the countless interpretations of the `` Star - Spangled Banner '' heard in the years since . One week after Feliciano 's performance , the anthem was in the news again when American athletes Tommie Smith and John Carlos lifted controversial raised fists at the 1968 Olympics while the `` Star - Spangled Banner '' played at a medal ceremony .
