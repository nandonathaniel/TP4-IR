In cryptography , a block cipher mode of operation is an algorithm that uses a block cipher to provide an information service such as confidentiality or authenticity . A block cipher by itself is only suitable for the secure cryptographic transformation ( encryption or decryption ) of one fixed - length group of bits called a block . A mode of operation describes how to repeatedly apply a cipher 's single - block operation to securely transform amounts of data larger than a block .
