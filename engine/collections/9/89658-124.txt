The Portuguese empire expanded into the Persian Gulf , contesting control of the spice trade with the Ajuran Empire and the Ottoman Empire . In 1515 , Afonso de Albuquerque conquered the Huwala state of Hormuz at the head of the Persian Gulf , establishing it as a vassal state . Aden , however , resisted Albuquerque 's expedition in that same year and another attempt by Albuquerque 's successor Lopo Soares de Albergaria in 1516 . In 1521 a force led by António Correia captured Bahrain , defeating the Jabrid King , Muqrin ibn Zamil . In a shifting series of alliances , the Portuguese dominated much of the southern Persian Gulf for the next hundred years . With the regular maritime route linking Lisbon to Goa since 1497 , the island of Mozambique became a strategic port , and there was built Fort São Sebastião and a hospital . In the Azores , the Islands Armada protected the ships en route to Lisbon .
