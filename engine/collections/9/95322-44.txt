In March 1888 , Macnaghten took Ranjitsinhji to London , with two other students who exhibited potential . One of the events to which Macnaghten took Ranjitsinhji was a cricket match between Surrey County Cricket Club and the touring Australian team . Ranjitsinhji was enthralled by the standard of cricket , and Charles Turner , an Australian known more as a bowler , scored a century in front of a large crowd ; Ranjitsinhji later said he did not see a better innings for ten years . Macnaghten returned to India that September but arranged for Ranjitsinhji and one of the other students , Ramsinhji , to live in Cambridge . Their second choice of lodgings proved successful , living with the family of Reverend Louis Borrisow , at the time the chaplain of Trinity College , Cambridge , who tutored them for the next year . Ranjitsinhji lived with the Borrisows until 1892 and remained close to them throughout his life . According to Roland Wild , Borrisow believed Ranji was `` lazy and irresponsible '' and obsessed with leisure activities including cricket , tennis , billiards and photography . Wild also says that he might have struggled to acclimatise to English life and did not settle to academic study . Possibly as a consequence , Ranjitsinhji failed the preliminary entrance exam to Trinity College in 1889 , but he and Ramsinhji were allowed to enter the college as `` youths of position '' . Nevertheless , Ranjitsinhji concentrated more on sport than study while at Cambridge , being content to work no more than necessary and he never graduated .
