Moose ( Alces alces shirasi Nelson ) , the largest member of the deer family , were reportedly very rare in northwest Wyoming when Yellowstone National Park was established in 1872 . Subsequent protection from hunting and wolf control programs may have contributed to increased numbers but suppression of forest fires probably was the most important factor , since moose here depend on mature fir forests for winter survival .
