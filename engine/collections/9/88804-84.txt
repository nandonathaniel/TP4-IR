As the nuclear powers pursued a test ban agreement , they also sought to contend with a rising communist China , which at the time was pursuing its own nuclear program . In 1955 , Mao Zedong expressed to the Soviet Union his belief that China could withstand a first nuclear strike and more than 100 million casualties . In the 1950s , the Soviet Union assisted the Chinese nuclear program , but stopped short of providing China with an actual nuclear bomb , which was followed by increasingly tense relations in the late 1950s and early 1960s . Khrushchev began the test - ban talks of 1958 with minimal prior discussion with China , and the two countries ' agreement on military - technology cooperation was terminated in June 1959 . Prior to the Moscow negotiations of the summer of 1963 , Kennedy granted Harriman significant latitude in reaching a `` Soviet - American understanding '' vis - Ã  - vis China . Secret Sino - Soviet talks in July 1963 revealed further discord between the two communist powers , as the Soviet Union released a statement that it did not `` share the views of the Chinese leadership about creating ' a thousand times higher civilization ' on the corpses of hundreds of millions of people . '' The Soviet Union also issued an ideological critique of China 's nuclear policy , declaring that China 's apparent openness to nuclear war was `` in crying contradiction to the idea of Marxism - Leninism , '' as a nuclear war would `` not distinguish between imperialists and working people .
