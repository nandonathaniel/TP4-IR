Despite its reputation for nonsense language , much of the dialogue in Absurdist plays is naturalistic . The moments when characters resort to nonsense language or clichés -- when words appear to have lost their denotative function , thus creating misunderstanding among the characters -- make the Theatre of the Absurd distinctive . Language frequently gains a certain phonetic , rhythmical , almost musical quality , opening up a wide range of often comedic playfulness . Jean Tardieu , for example , in the series of short pieces Theatre de Chambre arranged the language as one arranges music . Distinctively Absurdist language ranges from meaningless clichés to vaudeville - style word play to meaningless nonsense . The Bald Soprano , for example , was inspired by a language book in which characters would exchange empty clichés that never ultimately amounted to true communication or true connection . Likewise , the characters in The Bald Soprano -- like many other Absurdist characters -- go through routine dialogue full of clichés without actually communicating anything substantive or making a human connection . In other cases , the dialogue is purposefully elliptical ; the language of Absurdist Theater becomes secondary to the poetry of the concrete and objectified images of the stage . Many of Beckett 's plays devalue language for the sake of the striking tableau . Harold Pinter -- famous for his `` Pinter pause '' -- presents more subtly elliptical dialogue ; often the primary things characters should address are replaced by ellipsis or dashes . The following exchange between Aston and Davies in The Caretaker is typical of Pinter :
