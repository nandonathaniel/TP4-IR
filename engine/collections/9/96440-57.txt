The Maya political landscape was highly complex and Maya elites engaged in political intrigue to gain economic and social advantage over neighbours . In the Late Classic , some cities established a long period of dominance over other large cities , such as the dominance of Caracol over Naranjo for half a century . In other cases , loose alliance networks were formed around a dominant city . Border settlements , usually located about halfway between neighbouring capitals , often switched allegiance over the course of their history , and at times acted independently . Dominant capitals exacted tribute in the form of luxury items from subjugated population centres . Political power was reinforced by military power , and the capture and humiliation of enemy warriors played an important part in elite culture . An overriding sense of pride and honour among the warrior aristocracy could lead to extended feuds and vendettas , which caused political instability and the fragmentation of polities .
