Prior to the development of animal sciences such as comparative psychology and ethology , interpretation of animal behaviour tended to favour a minimalistic approach known as behaviourism . This approach refuses to ascribe to an animal a capability beyond the least demanding that would explain a behaviour ; anything more than this is seen as unwarranted anthropomorphism . The behaviourist argument is , why should humans postulate consciousness and all its near - human implications in animals to explain some behaviour , if mere stimulus - response is a sufficient explanation to produce the same effects ?
