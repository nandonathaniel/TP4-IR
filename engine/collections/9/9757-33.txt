Fans were `` widely against '' O'Malley's affair with Meredith in the second season , however certain fans who supported their relationship were critical when Torres was introduced as a love interest for him . Fans and critics were also against O'Malley's relationship with Stevens in the fourth season ; Maclean 's said : `` George must die . He 's slept with virtually everyone except the male cast and has been in love with virtually everyone except the male cast . And he 's not that great of a doctor . Evolve or die . '' Christopher Monfette of IGN said O'Malley and Stevens were a `` mismatch '' , adding : `` Unfortunately , while it 's refreshing to see a plotline driven by activity versus apathy , the idea of these two ever - affable , best - friend characters suddenly discovering their potential , out - of - nowhere love for each other quickly feels both force - fed and emotionally - incorrect . '' Similarly , DVD Verdict stated that George and Izzie were `` one of the strongest ' best friend ' vibes on television '' for the first three seasons , explaining `` they were perfect as friends ( while ) George and Callie made a good couple . '' UGO.com put the two on their list of `` Character Couples Who Should Have Never Happened '' .
