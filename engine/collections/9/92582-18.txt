Limited support for direct modification of files ( see # Direct modification and partial transfer features ) . To modify a file or its metadata , the whole file may need to be copied out of the device and reuploaded , which takes a long time for a large file or directory , and blocks the device for other operations in the meantime . Google 's MTP implementation in Android includes extensions to deal with this limitation ; however , these extensions must be supported by the host operating system .
