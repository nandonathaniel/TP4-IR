Meanwhile , three rebel columns , under the command of Che Guevara , Camilo Cienfuegos and Jaime Vega , proceeded westward toward Santa Clara , the capital of Villa Clara Province . Batista 's forces ambushed and destroyed Jaime Vega 's column , but the surviving two columns reached the central provinces , where they joined forces with several other resistance groups not under the command of Castro . When Che Guevara 's column passed through the province of Las Villas , and specifically through the Escambray Mountains -- where the anticommunist Revolutionary Directorate forces ( who became known as the 13 March Movement ) had been fighting Batista 's army for many months -- friction developed between the two groups of rebels . Nonetheless , the combined rebel army continued the offensive , and Cienfuegos won a key victory in the Battle of Yaguajay on 30 December 1958 , earning him the nickname `` The Hero of Yaguajay '' .
