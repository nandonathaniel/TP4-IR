In general , glycerophospholipids use a `` sn '' notation , which stands for stereospecific numbering . When the letters `` sn '' appear in the nomenclature , by convention the hydroxyl group of the second carbon of glycerol ( sn - 2 ) is on the left on a Fischer projection . The numbering follows the one of Fischer 's projections , being sn - 1 the carbon at the top and sn - 3 the one at the bottom .
