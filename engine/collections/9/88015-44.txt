Miranda was retried in 1967 after the original case against him was thrown out . This time the prosecution , instead of using the confession , introduced other evidence and called witnesses . One witness was Twila Hoffman , a woman with whom Miranda was living at the time of the offense ; she testified that he had told her of committing the crime . Miranda was convicted in 1967 and sentenced to serve 20 to 30 years . The Supreme Court of Arizona affirmed , and the United States Supreme Court denied review . Miranda was paroled in 1972 . After his release , he returned to his old neighborhood and made a modest living autographing police officers ' `` Miranda cards '' which contained the text of the warning , for reading to arrestees . He was stabbed to death during an argument in a bar on January 31 , 1976 . A suspect was arrested , but he , unlike Miranda , exercised his right to remain silent . With no evidence against him , he was released .
