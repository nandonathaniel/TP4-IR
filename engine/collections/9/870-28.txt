The Great British Bake Off , often referred to as Bake Off or GBBO , is a British television baking competition produced by Love Productions , in which a group of amateur bakers compete against each other in a series of rounds , attempting to impress a group of judges with their baking skills , with a contestant being eliminated in each round , with the winner being selected from the remaining contestants that make it to the finals . The show 's first episode was aired on 17 August 2010 , with its first four series broadcast on BBC Two , until its growing popularity led the BBC to move it to BBC One for the next three series . After its seventh series , Love Productions signed a three - year deal with Channel 4 to produce the show for the broadcaster . The programme is currently presented by Noel Fielding and Sandi Toksvig , with Paul Hollywood and Prue Leith on the judging panel .
