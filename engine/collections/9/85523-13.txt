Remarkable means of transportation were used in 1976 , when the flame was transformed to a radio signal and transmitted from Europe to the New World : Heat sensors in Athens detected the flame , the signal was sent to Ottawa via satellite where it was received and used to trigger a laser beam to re-light the flame . The torch , but not the flame , was taken into space by astronauts in 1996 , 2000 and 2013 . In 2000 , the torch was carried under the water by divers near the Great Barrier Reef . Other unique means of transportation include a Native American canoe , a camel , and Concorde . The torch has been carried across water ; the 1968 Grenoble Winter Games was carried across the port of Marseilles by a diver holding it aloft above the water . In 2000 , an underwater flare was used by a diver across the Great Barrier Reef en route to the Sydney Games . In 2012 it was carried by boat across Bristol harbour in the UK and on the front of a London Underground train to Wimbledon .
