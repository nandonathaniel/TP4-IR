While talking about Chris 's situation with Lois , Peter is suddenly confronted by the Giant Chicken . This is the third fight between the two . Their epic battle ranges from the Griffin house , through the sewers , onto a subway train , over the girders of a high - rise construction site , and then up into a biplane , crashing into a giant Ferris wheel , which is dislodged from its platform and rolls through the streets . The fight continues atop the rolling wheel until it demolishes a ten - story apartment building . Emerging from the wreckage , Peter and the Chicken realize that neither has any idea what they are fighting about . They apologize to each other , and the Chicken invites Peter to join him and his wife , Nicole , for dinner . At the restaurant , the three have just finished a lovely meal when the check arrives , and both Peter and the Chicken ( named Ernie ) insists on paying the tab -- Peter insists on paying since his order was kind of expensive while Ernie insists on paying as a way of apologizing to Peter . As they face off , the fight resumes and leads them into the restaurant kitchen . Peter subdues Ernie with a pot of boiling water and beats him unconscious . Peter staggers home , and back in the kitchen , Ernie lies lifeless on the floor , but in a sudden close - up , Ernie 's left eye opens as dramatic music plays , foreshadowing another chicken fight . Peter goes home and resumes his conversation with Lois .
