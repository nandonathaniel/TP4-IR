The Yoga 2 Pro is an Ultrabook - class device . It weighs 3.1 pounds , is 0.61 inch thick and has tapered edges , giving it an appearance more like a conventional ultrabook laptop vs the earlier model 's `` book - like '' symmetrical design . The Yoga 2 Pro features a 360 - Degree Flip - and-Fold design that encompasses four modes -- laptop , stand , tablet , and tent mode and has a subtle rubber trim around the edge of its top half in order to prevent slipping on hard surfaces when in tent mode . It comes with an backlit AccuType keyboard and features stereo speakers with Dolby Home Theater . Unlike earlier Yoga products , the home button has a touch - key on the bottom center of the display . Lenovo moved the power button away from the front and to the side in order to prevent accidental key presses .
