The Great Red Spot may have existed since before 1665 , but the present spot was first seen only after 1830 and well - studied only after a prominent apparition in 1879 . The storm people had seen in the 1600s may have been a different storm than the one we see today . A long gap separates its period of current study after 1830 from its seventeenth - century discovery ; whether the original spot dissipated and reformed , whether it faded , or even if the observational record was simply poor , are all unknown .
