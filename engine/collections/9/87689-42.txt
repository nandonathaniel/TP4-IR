Immediately after writing , Sheeran recorded the song on his phone . He was keen to include `` Thinking Out Loud '' on the second album . He properly recorded the song the following day at the Sticky Studios , a recording facility located in the small Surrey village of Windlesham , and informed Wadge of its inclusion on the album . It became the last song recorded for the album . For `` Thinking Out Loud '' , Sheeran sought the assistance of Jake Gosling , who produced much of his debut album and had earlier contributed tracks , four of which appear on the standard version of the second album .
