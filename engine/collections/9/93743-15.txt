The Standard format is continually one of the most popular formats in the constructed deck tournament scene . It is the format most commonly found at Friday Night Magic tournaments , played weekly at many hobby shops . Standard 's former name was `` Type 2 '' . This format generally consists of the most recent three or four `` Block '' releases . The release of the first set of a new Block in Autumn ( usually the first Friday in October ) triggers a rotation ; the new Block becomes Standard legal , and the oldest two blocks rotate out . ( The previous rule was using two recent `` Block '' releases plus any core sets released between the older set of the block and the first set that would make that block rotated out ) . The current Standard set includes the Ixalan block , Dominaria , Guilds of Ravnica and Core Set 2019 . Additionally , cards appeared in Welcome Deck 2017 and cards from Global Series : Jiang Yanggu & Mu Yanling ( only applied to events inside People 's Republic of China ) are also legal in current Standard .
