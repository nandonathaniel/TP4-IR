There can be little doubt , for instance , that the 90th hymn of the 10th book ( Purusha Sukta ) is modern both in its character and in its diction . ( ... ) It mentions the three seasons in the order of the Vasanta , spring ; Grishma , summer ; and Sarad , autumn ; it contains the only passage in the Rigveda where the four castes are enumerated . The evidence of language for the modern date of this composition is equally strong . Grishma , for instance , the name for the hot season , does not occur in any other hymn of the Rigveda ; and Vasanta also does not belong to the earliest vocabulary of the Vedic poets .
