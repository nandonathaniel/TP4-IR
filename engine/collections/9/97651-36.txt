In 1990 , the series transferred to BBC2 . By now , all the regulars ( with the exception of Peter Richardson ) had become more famous for their own shows , and more recurring performers such as Gary Beadle , Phil Cornwell , Steve O'Donnell , Mark Caven , Sara Stockbridge and Doon Mackichan were brought in . Rik Mayall was contracted to ITV 's The New Statesman , and was only able to appear in two of the BBC productions ( `` GLC '' , and the Comic Relief special `` Red Nose of Courage '' ) . Richardson and Richens took over the bulk of the writing again , and Richardson also took over as director , having previously directed the two feature films , as well as The Strike . The six - part 1990 series was followed by three individual specials in 1992 , and a final six episodes in 1993 .
