The foundations of the British Empire were laid when England and Scotland were separate kingdoms . In 1496 , King Henry VII of England , following the successes of Spain and Portugal in overseas exploration , commissioned John Cabot to lead a voyage to discover a route to Asia via the North Atlantic . Cabot sailed in 1497 , five years after the European discovery of America , but he made landfall on the coast of Newfoundland , and , mistakenly believing ( like Christopher Columbus ) that he had reached Asia , there was no attempt to found a colony . Cabot led another voyage to the Americas the following year but nothing was ever heard of his ships again .
