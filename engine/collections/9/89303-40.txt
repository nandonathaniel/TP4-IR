A majority of people do not start smoking at adulthood because of informed decision - making . As a result , much cigarette advertising was intended to target youth and depicted youths smoking and using tobacco as a form of leisure and enjoyment . Major cigarette companies would advertise their brands in popular TV shows such as The Flintstones and The Beverly Hillbillies , which were watched by many children and teens . In 1964 , after facing much pressure from the public , The Cigarette Advertising Code was created by the Tobacco companies , which prohibited advertising directed to youth .
