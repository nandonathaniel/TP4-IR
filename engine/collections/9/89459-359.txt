The Soviet Union became the first country to adopt a planned economy , whereby production and distribution of goods were centralized and directed by the government . The first Bolshevik experience with a command economy was the policy of War communism , which involved the nationalization of industry , centralized distribution of output , coercive requisition of agricultural production , and attempts to eliminate the circulation of money , as well as private enterprises and free trade . After the severe economic collapse caused by the war , Lenin replaced War Communism with the New Economic Policy ( NEP ) in 1921 , legalising free trade and private ownership of smaller businesses . The economy quickly recovered .
