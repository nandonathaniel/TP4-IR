The two scholars also discussed Parsons ' debate with Sch√ºtz and especially why Parsons had ended his encounter with Schutz . Parsons found that Schutz , rather than attempting to build social science theory , tended to get consumed in philosophical detours . Parsons wrote to Voegelin : `` Possibly one of my troubles in my discussion with Schuetz lies in the fact that by cultural heritage I am a Calvinist . I do not want to be a philosopher -- I shy away from the philosophical problems underlying my scientific work . By the same token I do n't think he wants to be a scientist as I understand the term until he has settled all the underlying philosophical difficulties . If the physicists of the 17th century had been Schuetzes there might well have been no Newtonian system . ''
