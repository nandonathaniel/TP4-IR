HRH Construction was hired as the contractor on Trump Tower . The company would go on to build many of Trump 's other real - estate developments . HRH hired several dozen subcontractors to work on different aspects of the building . Barbara Res , who had worked on some of Trump 's other projects , was hired as the construction executive in October 1980 . She had previously worked for HRH Construction during the building of the Citigroup Center and the Grand Hyatt . Res was the first woman assigned to oversee a major New York City construction site . She was often ignored by subcontractors and suppliers who were new to the project , as they thought the person in charge of construction was a man .
