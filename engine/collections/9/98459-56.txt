The Prince Edward and Marion Islands toothfish fishery is managed and regulated by Branch Fisheries , part of the South African Minister of Agriculture , Forestry and Fisheries . The South African Marine Resource Authorities fully supports and follows all CCAMLR Conservation Measures . The current TAC is 575t and is fished by two vessels belonging to two fishing companies / cooperatives , with catches having been restricted significantly following excessive illegal , unreported and unregulated ( IUU ) fishing in those waters in the late 1990s . TACs from this fishery have slowly started to increase as the stock begins to recover .
