Whereas histidine is positively charged and interacts well with the negative charges found on the surface of 2 , 3 - BPG , Serine has a neutrally charged side chain at physiological pH , and interacts less well . This change results in less binding of 2 , 3 - BPG to fetal Hb , and as a result oxygen will bind to it with higher affinity than adult hemoglobin .
