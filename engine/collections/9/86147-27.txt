In contemporary Christianity , the cross is a symbol of the atonement and reminds Christians of God 's love in sacrificing his own son for humanity . It represents Jesus ' victory over sin and death , since it is believed that through his death and resurrection he conquered death itself . See Colossians 2 : 15 , `` Having disarmed the powers and authorities , he made a public spectacle of them , triumphing over them by the cross .
