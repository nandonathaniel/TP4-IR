One Day International ( ODI ) cricket is played between international cricket teams who are Full Members of the International Cricket Council ( ICC ) as well as the top six Associate and Affiliate members . Unlike Test matches , ODIs consist of one innings per team , with a limit on the number of overs . The limit is currently 50 overs per innings , although in the past this has been 55 or 60 overs . ODI cricket is List - A cricket , so statistics and records set in ODI matches also count toward List - A records . The earliest match now recognised as an ODI was played between England and Australia on 5 January 1971 ; since then there have been over 3,000 ODIs played between 26 teams . The frequency of matches has steadily increased , partly because of the increase in the number of ODI - playing countries , and partly as the cricket boards of those nations seek to maximise their revenue .
