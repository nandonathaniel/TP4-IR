Although the Army 's focus was on conventional warfare , in late 1940 Lieutenant Colonel J.C. Mawhood , a British officer , arrived in Australia with a small specialist staff to conduct training in unconventional warfare . A school , known as No. 7 Infantry Training Centre , was opened at Wilsons Promontory , Victoria , which was described as `` an isolated area of high , rugged and heavily timbered mountains , precipitous valleys , swiftly running streams , and swamps . '' The 1st , 2nd and 3rd Independent Companies and a nucleus of the 4th were raised by October 1941 when training was discontinued . After the outbreak of the war with Japan , the school was reopened as the Guerrilla Warfare School , the training of the fourth company was completed . These independent companies were later redesignated as commando squadrons , of which twelve were eventually raised , including the 1st , which had been destroyed early in the war ; as the war progressed they were used more in the flank protection and reconnaissance roles than for unconventional warfare .
