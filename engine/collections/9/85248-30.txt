Debatable as the final scene is , in which for the first time Bigger calls a white man by his first name , Bigger is never anything but a failed human . He represents a black man conscious of a system of racial oppression that leaves him no opportunity to exist but through crime . As he says to Gus , `` They do n't let us do nothing ... ( and ) I ca n't get used to it . '' A line goes , one can not exist by simply reacting : a man must be more than the sum total of his brutalizations . Bigger admits to wanting to be an aviator and later , to Max , aspire to other positions esteemed in the American Dream . But here he can do nothing ... just be one of many blacks in what was called the `` ghetto '' and maybe get a job serving whites ; crime seems preferable , rather accidental or inevitable . Not surprisingly , then , he already has a criminal history , and he has even been to reform school . Ultimately , the snap decisions which law calls `` crimes '' arose from assaults to his dignity , and being trapped like the rat he killed with a pan living a life where others held the skillet .
