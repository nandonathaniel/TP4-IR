On 31 August 1964 , H.R. 1794 An Act to authorize payment for certain interests in lands within the Allegheny Indian Reservation in New York was passed by Congress and sent to the president for signature . The bill authorized payment for resettling and rehabilitation of the Seneca Indians who were being dislocated by the construction of the Kinzua Dam on the Allegheny River . Though only 127 Seneca families ( about 500 people ) were being dislocated , the legislation benefited the entire Seneca Nation , because the taking of the Indian land for the dam abridged a 1794 treaty agreement . In addition , the bill provided that within three years , a plan from the Interior Secretary should be submitted to Congress withdrawing all federal supervision over the Seneca Nation , though technically civil and criminal jurisdiction had lain with the State of New York since 1950 .
