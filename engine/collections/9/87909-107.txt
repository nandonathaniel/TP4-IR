The railway system of Prussia was more extensively developed than that within Austria . Railways made it possible to supply larger numbers of troops than hitherto and allowed the rapid movement of troops within friendly territory . The better Prussian rail network allowed the Prussian army to concentrate more rapidly than the Austrians . Moltke , reviewing his plans to Roon stated , `` We have the inestimable advantage of being able to carry our Field Army of 285,000 men over five railway lines and of virtually concentrating them in twenty - five days ... Austria has only one railway line and it will take her forty - five days to assemble 200,000 men . '' Moltke had also said earlier , `` Nothing could be more welcome to us than to have now the war that we must have . ''
