Singapore -- a partial ban on firecrackers was imposed in March 1970 after a fire killed six people and injured 68 . This was extended to a total ban in August 1972 , after an explosion that killed two people and an attack on two police officers attempting to stop a group from letting off firecrackers in February 1972 . As a result of this ban , the Chingay Parade was set up to preserve the spirit and culture . However , in 2003 , the government allowed firecrackers to be set off during the festive season . At the Chinese New Year light - up in Chinatown , at the stroke of midnight on the first day of the Chinese New Year , firecrackers are set off under controlled conditions by the Singapore Tourism Board with assistance from demolition experts from the Singapore Armed Forces . Other occasions where firecrackers are allowed to be set off are determined by the tourism board or other government organizations . However , they are not allowed to be commercially sold .
