There were very few major league teams in the far west until after World War II . As travel and settlement patterns changed , so did the geography of professional sports . The first west coast major - league franchise was the NFL 's Los Angeles Rams , who moved from Cleveland in 1946 . The same year , the All - America Football Conference began play , with teams in Los Angeles and San Francisco , and the Miami Seahawks . Baseball extended west in 1958 in the move of the Brooklyn Dodgers and New York Giants . The NBA followed in 1960 with the move of the Minneapolis Lakers to Los Angeles , while the NHL would not have a west coast presence until it expanded in 1967 . Almost all of the NHL 's initial franchises in the Southern and Western United States were unsuccessful and relocated . From 1982 until 1991 , the Kings were the only U.S. - based NHL franchise south of St. Louis and / or west of the Twin Cities . Since then , as newer , fast - growing Sunbelt areas such as Phoenix , Tampa , and Dallas became prominent , the major sports leagues have expanded or franchises have relocated to service these communities .
