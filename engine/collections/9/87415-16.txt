Established in 1912 , regulation of radio was a result of the U.S. Navy 's concern about interference to its stations and its desire to be able to order radio stations off the air in the event of war . U.S. radio broadcasting was first governed by the U.S. Department of Commerce ( the U.S. Department of Commerce and Labor until March 1913 ) , then by the Federal Radio Commission , and finally ( in 1934 ) by the FCC . The federal government 's licensing of amateur radio experimenters and operators has evolved considerably over the century since the inception of licensing .
