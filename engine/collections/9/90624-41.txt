In Majora 's Mask , he plays an integral role . On his travels to find rare masks , he is ambushed by the Skull Kid and his two fairies , Tatl and Tael ; they steal Majora 's Mask , a powerful , but malevolent , mask . Later , he meets Link inside the Clock Tower in Termina ; Link , whom the Skull Kid has cursed into a Deku Scrub , is asked to return the mask and to regain his own Ocarina . Once Link returns with the Ocarina , the Happy Mask Salesman teaches Link the Song of Healing , which transforms Link back into his normal form . Once Link finally destroys Majora , the entity inhabiting the mask , the Happy Mask Salesman regains the now - powerless mask , and leaves Link with some advice before walking away , then simply vanishing . It is unknown if he is the same character that appears in Ocarina of Time , as most inhabitants of Termina are counterparts corresponding to inhabitants of Hyrule .
