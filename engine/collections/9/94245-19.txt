Pliny , Ancient Rome 's most important historian concerning the arts , recorded that nearly all the forms of art -- sculpture , landscape , portrait painting , even genre painting -- were advanced in Greek times , and in some cases , more advanced than in Rome . Though very little remains of Greek wall art and portraiture , certainly Greek sculpture and vase painting bears this out . These forms were not likely surpassed by Roman artists in fineness of design or execution . As another example of the lost `` Golden Age '' , he singled out Peiraikos , `` whose artistry is surpassed by only a very few ... He painted barbershops and shoemakers ' stalls , donkeys , vegetables , and such , and for that reason came to be called the ' painter of vulgar subjects ' ; yet these works are altogether delightful , and they were sold at higher prices than the greatest paintings of many other artists . '' The adjective `` vulgar '' is used here in its original meaning , which means `` common '' .
