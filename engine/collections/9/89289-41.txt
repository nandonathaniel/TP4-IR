As the movie progresses , some characters can alternate between the TNG and DS9 / VOY uniforms and sometimes switch back to the old TNG uniforms ( for instance , Picard switched back to the TNG uniform in the film 's last scene ) . This would act as an introduction of the new design as standard shipboard wear for Star Trek : Voyager .
