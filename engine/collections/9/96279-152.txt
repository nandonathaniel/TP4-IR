The majority of Bangkok 's population are of Thai ethnicity , although details on the city 's ethnic make - up are unavailable , as the national census does not document race . Bangkok 's cultural pluralism dates back to the early days of its foundation ; several ethnic communities were formed by immigrants and forced settlers including the Khmer , Northern Thai , Lao , Vietnamese , Tavoyan , Mon and Malay . Most prominent were the Chinese , who played major roles in the city 's trade and became the majority of Bangkok 's population -- estimates include up to three - fourths in 1828 and almost half in the 1950s . However , Chinese immigration was restricted from the 1930s and effectively ceased after the Chinese Revolution in 1949 . Their prominence subsequently declined as most of younger generations of Thai Chinese have integrated and adopted a Thai identity . Bangkok is still nevertheless home to a large Chinese community , with the greatest concentration in Yaowarat , Bangkok 's Chinatown . The majority ( 91 percent ) of the city 's population is Buddhist . Other religions include Islam ( 4.7 % ) , Christianity ( 2.0 % ) , Hinduism ( 0.5 % ) , Sikhism ( 0.1 % ) and Confucianism ( 0.1 % ) .
