Construction of the tower began under architect Ahmad Ben Baso in 1184 . After Ben Baso 's death , other architects continued work on the tower . The mathematician and astronomer Jabir ibn Aflah ( or Geber ) is also often credited with the tower 's design . The tower was completed March 10 , 1198 with the installation of copper spheres on the tower 's top . The Almohads built similar towers in what are now Spain and Morocco during this period . The tower of the Koutoubia Mosque in Marrakesh served as a model for the Giralda and its sister , the Hassan Tower in Rabat .
