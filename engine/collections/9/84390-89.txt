The first U.S. Clean Water Act , passed by a Congressional override after being vetoed by US President Richard Nixon in 1972 , was a key piece of legislation , along with the bi-national Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement signed by Canada and the U.S. A variety of steps taken to process industrial and municipal pollution discharges into the system greatly improved water quality by the 1980s , and Lake Erie in particular is significantly cleaner . Discharge of toxic substances has been sharply reduced . Federal and state regulations control substances like PCBs . The first of 43 `` Great Lakes Areas of Concern '' to be formally `` de-listed '' due to successful cleanup was Ontario 's Collingwood Harbour in 1994 ; Ontario 's Severn Sound followed in 2003 . Presque Isle Bay in Pennsylvania is formally listed as in recovery , as is Ontario 's Spanish Harbour . Dozens of other Areas of Concern have received partial cleanups such as the Rouge River ( Michigan ) and Waukegan Harbor ( Illinois ) .
