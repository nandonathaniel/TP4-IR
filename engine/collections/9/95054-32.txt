Though officially credited to Lennon -- McCartney , McCartney was primarily responsible for the writing of the song , to which he also contributed lead vocals . It was recorded at Abbey Road Studios between 7 April and 17 June 1966 and evolved considerably between the first takes and the final version released on album . The song seems to have been hard to arrange until the soul - style horns , strongly reminiscent of the Stax ' Memphis soul and Motown sound , were introduced . The brass was close - miked in the bells of the instruments , then put through a limiter . The percussion instrument most predominant is the overdubbed tambourine .
