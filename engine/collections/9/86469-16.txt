An equinox is commonly regarded as the moment when the plane of Earth 's equator passes through the center of the Sun 's disk , which occurs twice each year , around 20 March and 23 September . In other words , it is the point in which the center of the visible sun is directly over the equator . This simplified , but incorrect , understanding of Earth 's orbital motion can lead to errors of up to 69 seconds from the actual time of equinox .
