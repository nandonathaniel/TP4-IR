The mission further develops a design inherited from the 2008 Phoenix Mars Lander . Because InSight is powered by solar panels , it will land near the equator to enable maximum power for a projected lifetime of 2 years ( 1 Martian year ) . InSight is designed to be launched by an Atlas V rocket ; the mission will include two CubeSats that will launch with InSight but will fly separately to Mars .
