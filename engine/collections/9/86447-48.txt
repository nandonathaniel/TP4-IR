On December 23 , 1783 , the State of New Jersey presented him with the use of an estate in Bergen County now known as Steuben House , which had been confiscated from Loyalist Jan Zabriskie in 1781 . Located in the formerly strategic New Bridge Landing , the estate included a gristmill and about 40 acres of land . Legislators initially conditioned the grant , requiring Steuben to `` hold , occupy and enjoy the said estate in person , and not by tenant . '' Gen. Philemon Dickinson of the New Jersey Militia informed the baron of this gift and responded to his inquiries that `` there are on the premises an exceeding good House , an excellent barn , together with many useful outbuildings , all of which I am told , want some repairs ... there is ... a Grist - mill ; a good Orchard , some meadow Ground , & plenty of Wood . The distance from N York by land 15 miles , but you may keep a boat & go from your own door to N York by water -- Oysters , Fish & wild fowl in abundance -- Possession will be given to you in the Spring , when you will take a view of the premises . '' Von Steuben spent considerable sums to repair wartime damages to the house and restore its commercial operations under former aide Walker .
