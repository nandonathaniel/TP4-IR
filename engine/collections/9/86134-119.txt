In 979 , Emperor Đinh Tiên Hoàng and his crown prince Đinh Liễn were assassinated , leaving his lone surviving son , the 6 - year - old Đinh Toàn , to assume the throne . Taking advantage of the situation , Song China invaded Annam . Facing such a grave threat to national independence , the commander of the armed forces , ( Thập Đạo Tướng Quân ) Lê Hoàn took the throne , founding the Early Lê dynasty . A capable military tactician , Lê Hoan realized the risks of engaging the mighty Song troops head on ; thus he tricked the invading army into Chi Lăng Pass , then ambushed and killed their commander , quickly ending the threat to his young nation in 981 . The Song dynasty withdrew their troops and Lê Hoàn was referred to in his realm as Emperor Đại Hành ( Đại Hành Hoàng Đế ) . Emperor Lê Đại Hành was also the first Vietnamese monarch who began the southward expansion process against the kingdom of Champa .
