Before the Eighteenth Amendment went into effect in January 1920 , many of the upper classes stockpiled alcohol for legal home consumption after Prohibition began . They bought the inventories of liquor retailers and wholesalers , emptying out their warehouses , saloons , and club storerooms . President Woodrow Wilson moved his own supply of alcoholic beverages to his Washington residence after his term of office ended . His successor , Warren G. Harding , relocated his own large supply into the White House after inauguration .
