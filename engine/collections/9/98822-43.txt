`` First news from Galveston just received by train that could get no closer to the bay shore than 6 mi ( 9.7 km ) where the prairie was strewn with debris and dead bodies . About 200 corpses counted from the train . Large steamship stranded 2 mi ( 3.2 km ) inland . Nothing could be seen of Galveston . Loss of life and property undoubtedly most appalling . Weather clear and bright here with gentle southeast wind . '' -- G.L. Vaughan Manager , Western Union , Houston , in a telegram to the Chief of the U.S. Weather Bureau on the day after the hurricane , September 9 , 1900
