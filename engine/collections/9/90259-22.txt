Before the outbreak , Philip and Brian Blake were raised by an abusive father . As an adult , Philip worked an office job with a boss he did n't get along with , was married , and had a daughter named Penny . Eighteen months before the outbreak , Philip lost his wife in a car accident . During the early days of the outbreak , Philip and Penny survived and found a community in Woodbury . Penny was bitten , however , and turned into a zombie . Unable to accept her death , Philip locked her up in a private room in his office . When the community was leaderless , they picked Philip to lead and began calling him `` The Governor '' , a nickname which stuck . Determined not to lose the community , he executed any outsider groups he saw as a threat . He allowed some smaller groups to move into Woodbury if he deemed them to be an asset and not a threat to his leadership , but still took precautions and had them monitored by his lieutenants until he deemed them trustworthy . At some point during the first and second season The Governor encounters a dying Merle Dixon , whom The Governor enlisted , along with Caesar Martinez and Milton Mamet , as his lieutenant and advisers . He also tasks Milton , a scientist , with researching a means to reverse the virus in the hopes of saving Penny . The Governor was also known to have had affairs with many of the Woodbury women .
