Mermaid tears , Neptune forebode the mermaids to use their abilities to change the course of nature . In a horrible storm , one mermaid weathered the crossings for a ship . She had , over time , grown to fall in love with the ship 's captain from afar . When she calmed the wind and waves to save the man 's life , Neptune angrily exiled her to the depths of the ocean . She was condemned for eternity and ordered never to swim to the surface again . Still , today , her brightly gleaming tears wash up on the shore as sea glass as a reminder of true love .
