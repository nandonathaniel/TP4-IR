On June 13 , 2006 , a proposed salary management system featuring a Maximum Salary Expenditure Cap ( SEC ) was ratified at the Canadian Football League board of governors meeting in Winnipeg , Manitoba . The CFL began enforcing strict salary cap regulation for the 2007 season , which was set at $4.05 million with a salary floor of $3,746,250 . The cap will be set at $5.2 million for the 2018 season or an average salary of $113,043 per active roster player . However , most clubs spend between $7,000,000 to $8,000,000 per season on salaries due to injury exemptions allowed under the cap .
