The Gators returned all five starters from their 2006 championship team to begin the 2006 -- 07 basketball season ranked as the preseason No. 1 in both major media polls , a first for the Gators . The Gators locked up the SEC Championship relatively early in the 2006 -- 07 season and were in possession of a 24 -- 2 record before going on a late - February 1 -- 3 skid that mirrored their 0 -- 3 run a year earlier . For the second season in a row , the losses in February would be their last . Florida closed out Kentucky on Senior Night to end the regular season 26 -- 5 , and won their third straight SEC Tournament Championship with relative ease , beating Georgia , Ole Miss , and Arkansas 77 -- 56 .
