That κ corresponds to attenuation can be seen by inserting this refractive index into the expression for electric field of a plane electromagnetic wave traveling in the z - direction . We can do this by relating the complex wave number k to the complex refractive index n through k = 2πn / λ , with λ being the vacuum wavelength ; this can be inserted into the plane wave expression as
