The Environment - Economy - Ecology , or the E3 , house sits outside of the John E. Thomas Building on Campus . The E3 house was built by students in the building science and appropriate technology programs at Appalachian State University . The ASU Renewable Energy Initiative allocated $30,000 towards the photovoltaic ( PV ) rooftop array . The 500 - square - foot ( 46 m ) house is used to test innovative technologies in building practices . Unlike most compact and transportable shelters , the structure is designed to be self - sufficient and adaptable to a variety of environmental and cultural situations . The design incorporates a blend of structural insulated panels for assembly speed and strength , combined with local construction techniques to create an energy - efficient envelope . It can accommodate up to five occupants . The building 's energy - efficient features include use of structural insulated panels ( SIPs ) for the building 's exterior walls and roof . The panels have an insulation R - value of 30 , compared to R - 19 in typical home construction . The building also has solar panels , which generate energy needs for the occupants , a system to collect rainwater from the roof , and low - flow plumbing fixtures . The PV array uses 16 panels to produce an estimated 3,745 kilowatt - hours ( 13,480 MJ ) per year .
