Wrigley is now the only professional ballpark with an ivy covered outfield wall . Several now - demolished ballparks featured ivy in the playing area , including Forbes Field , Wrigley Field 's namesake in Los Angeles , and Bush Stadium ( formerly Perry Stadium ) in Indianapolis . Omaha 's Rosenblatt Stadium , the former home of the College World Series as well as minor league baseball , had an ivy - covered brick wall that was replaced with a padded wall . Some ballparks feature ivy on out - of - play walls , especially as a covering for the batter 's eye behind the center field fence .
