The modern deck contains 45 cards : there are five 1 cards as well as four each of the other cards ( Sorry ! , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 7 , 8 , 10 , 11 and 12 ) . There are no 6s or 9s , to avoid confusion . The first edition of the game had 44 cards ( four of each ) and the extra 1 card was soon introduced as an option for quicker play . A 1996 board from Waddingtons had 5 of each card .
