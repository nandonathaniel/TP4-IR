Several localities claim to be the area to which the building was moved . The street address of the Crystal Palace was Sydenham ( SE26 ) after 1917 , but the actual building and parklands were in Penge . When built , most of the buildings were in the County of Surrey , as were the majority of grounds , but in 1899 the county boundary was moved , transferring the entire site to Penge Urban District in Kent . The site is now within the Crystal Palace Ward of the London Borough of Bromley .
