The National School Lunch Program did exactly resemble what many had hoped it would . In the late eighteenth century and early nineteenth century the science of nutrition was struggling to find its place in American culture . The general public did not broadly accept the importance of healthy eating and living . However , the economic depression and the New Deal became an opportunity for nutrition reformers to shape food and nutrition policy . `` In fact , the National School Lunch Program created in 1946 bore only slight resemblance to the goals of nutrition scientists and home economists . The program was , in its goals , structure and administration , more a subsidy for agriculture than a nutrition program for children . Indeed , the political will to forge a national school lunch program came not from the New Deal social welfare coalition but rather from the Department of Agriculture and a group of southern Democratic legislators who generally opposed federal social programs .
