Status quo : with this approach , historical emissions are ignored , and current emission levels are taken as a status quo right to emit ( Banuri et al. , 1996 , p. 107 ) . An analogy for this approach can be made with fisheries , which is a common , limited resource . The analogy would be with the atmosphere , which can be viewed as an exhaustible natural resource ( Goldemberg et al. , 1996 , p. 27 ) . In international law , one state recognized the long - established use of another state 's use of the fisheries resource . It was also recognized by the state that part of the other state 's economy was dependent on that resource .
