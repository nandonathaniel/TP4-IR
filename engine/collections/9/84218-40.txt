In the 1998 World Cup in France , the team lost all of their three group matches , 0 -- 2 to Germany , 1 -- 2 to Iran , and 0 -- 1 to Yugoslavia , and so finished in last place in its group and 32nd in the field of 32 . Head coach Steve Sampson received much of the blame for the performance as a result of abruptly cutting team captain John Harkes , whom Sampson had ironically named `` Captain for Life '' shortly before , as well as several other players who were instrumental to the qualifying effort , from the squad .
