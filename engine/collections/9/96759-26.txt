Aside from George himself , the only recurring character in the original adventures is the unnamed Man with the Yellow Hat . It was he who lured George into a trap with his hat , captured him in a bag , and forcibly brought him from Africa , and in his house that George lives . The Man often facilitates George 's adventures by taking him somewhere , and even more often resolves the tension by intervening just in time to get George out of a tight spot . He is always seen wearing a bright yellow suit and a wide brimmed yellow hat . The Man is never mentioned by name in the original adventures or in any subsequent content over more than six decades .
