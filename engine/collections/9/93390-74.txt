A few months after its United States release , The Sound of Music opened in 261 theaters overseas -- the first American movie to be completely dubbed in a foreign language , both dialogue and music . The German , French , Italian , and Spanish versions were completely dubbed , the Japanese version had Japanese dialogue with English songs , and other versions were released with foreign subtitles . The film was a popular success in every country it opened , except the two countries where the story originated , Austria and Germany . In these countries , the film had to compete with the much - loved Die Trapp - Familie ( 1956 ) , which provided the original inspiration for the Broadway musical , and its sequel Die Trapp - Familie in Amerika ( 1958 ) -- both films still widely popular in German - speaking Europe and considered the authoritative von Trapp story . Austrians took exception to the liberties taken by the filmmakers with regard to the costumes , which did not reflect traditional style , and the replacement of traditional Austrian folk songs with Broadway show tunes . The film 's Nazi theme was especially unpopular in Germany , where the Munich branch manager for 20th Century Fox approved the unauthorized cutting of the entire third act of the film following the wedding sequence -- the scenes showing Salzburg following the Anschluss . Robert Wise and the studio intervened , the original film was restored , and the branch manager was fired . The Sound of Music has never been popular in Austria and Germany .
