The early 1980s were marked by Ted Stepien 's ownership , who had a disastrous run as owner and de facto general manager between 1980 and 1983 . During Stepien 's reign , the Cavaliers made a practice of trading future draft picks for marginal veteran players . His most notable deal sent a 1982 first - round pick to the Los Angeles Lakers in exchange for Dan Ford and the 22nd overall pick in 1980 . As a result of Stepien 's dealings , the NBA introduced the `` Stepien Rule '' , which prohibits teams from trading first - round draft picks in successive seasons . The Cavaliers went 66 -- 180 , dropped to the bottom of the league in attendance and lost $15 million during Stepien 's three years as the owner . The Cavs went through six coaches during that span , including four during the 1981 -- 82 season . The team finished 15 -- 67 , and between March and November 1982 , the team had a 24 - game losing streak , which at the time , was the NBA 's longest losing streak . George and Gordon Gund purchased the Cavaliers from Stepien in 1983 .
