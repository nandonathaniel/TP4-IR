The setting was also moved from Denver to Atlanta , in part because of Atlanta 's diversity . Schwartz called the city `` a realistic location of this family to be based out of '' , noting that the Shapiros had arbitrarily picked Denver for the original series and were not creatively attached to it . Patrick said that Atlanta is `` a super diverse population and a great mixture -- where there 's conflict between old money and new money . '' Kelley said , `` This modern version represents a more current picture of what 's happening in America . The diversity of the cast really represents that . '' In the update , chauffeur Michael Culhane and the Colby family are African - American . Also , Cristal 's Venezuelan origins will allow the show to explore the current geopolitics of that country .
