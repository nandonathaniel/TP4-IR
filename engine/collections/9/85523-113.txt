For the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , the cauldron was lit inside the Maracanã Stadium , the ceremonial venue for the Games , by Vanderlei de Lima . As part of these Games ' appeal towards environmental protection , organizers deliberately chose to use a basic design with a smaller flame than past cauldrons . To compensate for the smaller cauldron , it is accompanied by a larger kinetic sculpture designed by Anthony Howe . A public cauldron was lit in a plaza outside the Candelária Church following the opening ceremony .
