Bigg Boss Telugu is a reality show based on the Hindi show Bigg Boss which too was based on the original Dutch Big Brother format developed by John de Mol . A number of contestants ( known as `` housemates '' ) live in a purpose - built house and are isolated from the rest of the world . Each week , housemates nominate two of their fellow housemates for eviction , and the housemates who receives the most nominations would face a public vote . Eventually , one housemate would leave after being `` evicted '' from the House . In the final week , there were five housemates remaining , and the public voted for who they wanted to win . Unlike other versions of Big Brother , the Indian version uses celebrities as housemates , not members of the general public .
