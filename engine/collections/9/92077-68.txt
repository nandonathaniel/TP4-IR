When a hardware device triggers an interrupt , the operating system 's kernel decides how to deal with this event , generally by running some processing code . The amount of code being run depends on the priority of the interrupt ( for example : a person usually responds to a smoke detector alarm before answering the phone ) . The processing of hardware interrupts is a task that is usually delegated to software called a device driver , which may be part of the operating system 's kernel , part of another program , or both . Device drivers may then relay information to a running program by various means .
