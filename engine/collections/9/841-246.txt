In September 1858 Rae Ahmed Nawaz Khan Kharal , head of the Khurrul tribe , led an insurrection in the Neeli Bar district , between the Sutlej , Ravi and Chenab rivers . The rebels held the jungles of Gogaira and had some initial successes against the British forces in the area , besieging Major Crawford Chamberlain at Chichawatni . A squadron of Punjabi cavalry sent by Sir John Lawrence raised the siege . Ahmed Khan was killed but the insurgents found a new leader in Mahr Bahawal Fatyana , who maintained the uprising for three months until Government forces penetrated the jungle and scattered the rebel tribesmen .
