Asteroids except for the largest , Ceres , are classified as small Solar System bodies and are composed mainly of refractory rocky and metallic minerals , with some ice . They range from a few metres to hundreds of kilometres in size . Asteroids smaller than one meter are usually called meteoroids and micrometeoroids ( grain - sized ) , depending on different , somewhat arbitrary definitions .
