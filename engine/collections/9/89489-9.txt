The western routes were the Walata Road , from the Sénégal River , and the Taghaza Trail , from the Mali River , which had their northern termini at the great trading center of Sijilmasa , situated in Morocco just north of the desert . The growth of the city of Aoudaghost , founded in the 5th century BCE , was stimulated by its position at the southern end of a trans Saharan trade route .
