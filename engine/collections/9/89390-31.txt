They quickly realize the Nazi headpiece is incomplete and that the Nazis are digging in the wrong place . The Nazis kidnap Marion and it appears to Jones that she is killed in an exploding truck . After a confrontation with Belloq in a local bar , Indy and Sallah infiltrate the Nazi dig site and use their staff to correctly locate the Ark .

Indy , Sallah , and a small group of diggers unearth the Well of Souls and acquire the Ark .

Jones and Marion escape to a local airstrip , where Jones has a fistfight with a Nazi mechanic and destroys the flying wing that was to transport the Ark to Berlin . The panicked Nazis remove the Ark in a truck and set off for Cairo , but Jones catches them and retakes it . He makes arrangements to take the Ark to London aboard a tramp steamer .
