In the morning of this birthday ( traditionally anytime from midnight to 7 am ) , Taiwanese households set up an altar table with 3 layers : one top ( containing offertories of six vegetables ( Chinese : 六 斋 ; pinyin : liù zhāi ) , noodles , fruits , cakes , tangyuan , vegetable bowls , and unripe betel , all decorated with paper lanterns ) and two lower levels ( containing the five sacrifices and wines ) to honor the deities below the Jade Emperor . The household then kneels three times and kowtows nine times to pay obeisance and wish him a long life .
