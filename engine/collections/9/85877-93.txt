Supersets combine two or more exercises with similar motions to maximize the amount of work of an individual muscle or group of muscles . The exercises are performed with no rest period between the exercises . An example would be doing bench press , which predominantly works the pectoralis and triceps muscles , and then moving to an exercise that works just the triceps such as the triceps extension or the pushdown .
