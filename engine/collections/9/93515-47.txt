Philosophy ( i.e. , physics ) is written in this grand book -- I mean the universe -- which stands continually open to our gaze , but it can not be understood unless one first learns to comprehend the language and interpret the characters in which it is written . It is written in the language of mathematics , and its characters are triangles , circles , and other geometrical figures , without which it is humanly impossible to understand a single word of it ; without these , one is wandering around in a dark labyrinth .
