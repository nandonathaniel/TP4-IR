In May 1624 , the first settlers in New Netherland arrived on Noten Eylandt ( Nut or Nutten Island , now Governors Island ) aboard the ship New Netherland under the command of Cornelius Jacobsen May , who disembarked on the island with thirty families in order to take legal possession of the New Netherland territory . The families were then dispersed to Fort Wilhelmus on Verhulsten Island ( Burlington Island ) in the South River ( now the Delaware River ) , to Kievitshoek ( now Old Saybrook , Connecticut ) at the mouth of the Verse River ( now the Connecticut River ) and further north at Fort Nassau on the Mauritius or North River ( now the Hudson River ) , near what is now Albany .
