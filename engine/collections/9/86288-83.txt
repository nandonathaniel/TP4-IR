American mathematical physicist J. Willard Gibbs 's work on the applications of thermodynamics was instrumental in transforming physical chemistry into a rigorous deductive science . During the years from 1876 to 1878 , Gibbs worked on the principles of thermodynamics , applying them to the complex processes involved in chemical reactions . He discovered the concept of chemical potential , or the `` fuel '' that makes chemical reactions work . In 1876 he published his most famous contribution , `` On the Equilibrium of Heterogeneous Substances '' , a compilation of his work on thermodynamics and physical chemistry which laid out the concept of free energy to explain the physical basis of chemical equilibria . In these essays were the beginnings of Gibbs ' theories of phases of matter : he considered each state of matter a phase , and each substance a component . Gibbs took all of the variables involved in a chemical reaction - temperature , pressure , energy , volume , and entropy - and included them in one simple equation known as Gibbs ' phase rule .
