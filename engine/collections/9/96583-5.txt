The name hannya ( 般若 ) is a Sino - Japanese word for prajna or wisdom . One tradition states that this name was given to this mask because it was the name of an artist monk Hannya - bō ( 般若 坊 ) who is said to have perfected its creation . An alternative explanation is that the artist would need a great deal of wisdom in order to create this mask .
