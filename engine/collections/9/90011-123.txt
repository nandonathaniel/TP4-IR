The Easter ( or Paschal ) Triduum splits the Easter vigil of the early church into three days of celebration , of Jesus the Lord 's Supper , of Good Friday ( Jesus ' passion and death on the cross ) , and of Jesus ' resurrection . The season of Eastertide follows the Triduum and climaxes on Pentecost , recalling the descent of the Holy Spirit upon Jesus ' disciples in the upper room .
