Application software Application software or Applications are what most people think of when they think of software . Typical examples include office suites and video games . Application software is often purchased separately from computer hardware . Sometimes applications are bundled with the computer , but that does not change the fact that they run as independent applications . Applications are usually independent programs from the operating system , though they are often tailored for specific platforms . Most users think of compilers , databases , and other `` system software '' as applications .
