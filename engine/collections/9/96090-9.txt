Section 4 ( 1 ) of the Homicide Act 1957 introduced the defence of suicide pact . Parliament 's intention was to show some compassion for those who had been involved in a suicide pact but failed to die . Section 4 ( 3 ) defines a suicide pact as `` a common agreement between two or more persons having for its object the death of all of them , whether or not each is to take his own life '' . Further the accused must have had a `` settled intention of dying in pursuance of the pact '' to avoid the accused entering into a supposed pact with the real intention of committing murder . The Law Commission has proposed abolishing the defence with deserving cases falling within diminished responsibility , but feels it should be retained pending a review of a new partial defence of mercy killings .
