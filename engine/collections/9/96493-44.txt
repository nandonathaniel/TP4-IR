The Continental Army of 1781 -- 82 saw the greatest crisis on the American side in the war . Congress was bankrupt , making it very difficult to replenish the soldiers whose three - year terms had expired . Popular support for the war reached an all - time low , and Washington had to put down mutinies both in the Pennsylvania Line and in the New Jersey Line . Congress voted to cut funding for the Army , but Washington managed nevertheless to secure important strategic victories .
