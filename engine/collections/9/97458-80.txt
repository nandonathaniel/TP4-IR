U-God ( born Lamont Jody Hawkins , 1970 ) -- A founding member with his own solo career , U-God's has had a relatively low profile , in part due to his limited exposure , from being incarcerated for most of the recording of 36 Chambers , in which he only delivered short verses on `` Da Mystery of Chessboxin ' '' and `` Protect Ya Neck . '' He is known for delivering strong verses , his unique `` bass - like '' voice , and his style of blaxploitation rap .
