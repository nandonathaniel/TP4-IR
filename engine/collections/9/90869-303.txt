When Louis Jolliet explored the Mississippi Valley in the 17th century , natives guided him to a quicker way to return to French Canada via the Illinois River . When he found the Chicago Portage , he remarked that a canal of `` only half a league '' ( less than 2 miles ( 3.2 km ) , 3 km ) would join the Mississippi and the Great Lakes . In 1848 , the continental divide separating the waters of the Great Lakes and the Mississippi Valley was breached by the Illinois and Michigan canal via the Chicago River . This both accelerated the development , and forever changed the ecology of the Mississippi Valley and the Great Lakes .
