Both the Lutheran Church -- Missouri Synod ( LCMS ) and the Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod ( WELS ) , along with the United Methodist Church use a similar system , but with purple being the primary colour for both Advent and Lent ( with blue being the alternate colour for Advent only ) , and the use of gold in place of white for both Christmas and Easter ( in similar practice to the Catholic Church ) . In the WELS , the use of red is also done during the Period of End Times , a period of the Church regarding the teachings of the Book of Revelation , culminating in the creation of the New Jerusalem ( corresponding to Christ the King in the ELCA ) . In all three churches , including the ELCA , red is also worn on the last Sunday of October , in celebration of the Reformation on October 31 , when Martin Luther nailed the 95 Theses onto the door of Wittenberg Castle Church .
