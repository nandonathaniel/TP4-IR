45 / 09 - 5 Thursday , 29 June 2017 Time or Ingredients Elimination Challenge - Callan , Diana , Eloise and Sam competed in the time displacement elimination challenge from series 8 where they had to gather their ingredients from one of the following four different hidden pantries on the prescribed time limit . Eloise , Sam and Callan had 60 minutes to cook with herbs , fruits and vegetables while Diana waited for the last pantry ( protein ) with 30 minutes left to cook . Her risk paid off when her dish was praised by the judges , along with Eloise 's ice cream dessert . The difficult decision was between Callan and Sam as their dishes did not impress . Callan took a risk with odd flavour combinations in his ice cream dessert , while Sam 's execution let him down when his flawed elements impacted the presentation and taste of his dessert . As a result , he was eliminated from the competition . Tamara and Sarah will fly business class for the Top 9 contestants ' trip to Japan after winning the team challenge . 899,000 # 5
