Metal ions are common cofactors . The study of these cofactors falls under the area of bioinorganic chemistry . In nutrition , the list of essential trace elements reflects their role as cofactors . In humans this list commonly includes iron , magnesium , manganese , cobalt , copper , zinc , and molybdenum . Although chromium deficiency causes impaired glucose tolerance , no human enzyme that uses this metal as a cofactor has been identified . Iodine is also an essential trace element , but this element is used as part of the structure of thyroid hormones rather than as an enzyme cofactor . Calcium is another special case , in that it is required as a component of the human diet , and it is needed for the full activity of many enzymes , such as nitric oxide synthase , protein phosphatases , and adenylate kinase , but calcium activates these enzymes in allosteric regulation , often binding to these enzymes in a complex with calmodulin . Calcium is , therefore , a cell signaling molecule , and not usually considered a cofactor of the enzymes it regulates .
