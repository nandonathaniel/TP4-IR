The fourth studio album from British rock band Oasis is titled Standing on the Shoulder of Giants . Songwriter Noel Gallagher chose the name after reading it printed on the edge of a Â£ 2 coin ; he scribbled the phrase down but spelled it incorrectly with the word ' Shoulder ' rather than ' Shoulders ' as he was inebriated at the time .
