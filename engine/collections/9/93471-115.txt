Several spontaneous practices have become characteristic of Pentecostal worship . Being `` slain in the Spirit '' or `` falling under the power '' is a form of prostration in which a person falls backwards , as if fainting , while being prayed over . It is at times accompanied by glossolalic prayer ; at other times , the person is silent . It is believed by Pentecostals to be caused by `` an overwhelming experience of the presence of God '' , and Pentecostals sometimes receive the baptism in the Holy Spirit in this posture . Another spontaneous practice is `` dancing in the Spirit '' . This is when a person leaves their seat `` spontaneously ' dancing ' with eyes closed without bumping into nearby persons or objects '' . It is explained as the worshipper becoming `` so enraptured with God 's presence that the Spirit takes control of physical motions as well as the spiritual and emotional being '' . Pentecostals derive biblical precedent for dancing in worship from 2 Samuel 6 , where David danced before the Lord . A similar occurrence is often called `` running the aisles '' . The `` Jericho march '' ( inspired by Book of Joshua 6 : 1 -- 27 ) is a celebratory practice occurring at times of high enthusiasm . Members of a congregation began to spontaneously leave their seats and walk in the aisles inviting other members as they go . Eventually , a full column is formed around the perimeter of the meeting space as worshipers march with singing and loud shouts of praise and jubilation . In some Pentecostal churches , these spontaneous expressions are primarily found in revival meetings or special prayer meetings , being rare or non-existent in the main services .
