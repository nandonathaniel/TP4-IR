The first movement , in time , begins gently and reflectively , with languid double stops and a flowing violin melody line filled with tasteful embellishments . The melody , which moves from the tonic to the mediant key in the middle of the movement includes several deceptive cadences , before returning once again to a tonic theme similar to the beginning . A crisp , quick , highly decorated bravura follows , preceding a brief cantabile slow movement , said to signify Tartini 's dream state .
