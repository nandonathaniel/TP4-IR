As per the Annual Status of Education Report ( ASER ) 2012 , 96.5 % of all rural children between the ages of 6 - 14 were enrolled in school . This is the fourth annual survey to report enrollment above 96 % . Another report from 2013 stated that there were 22.9 crore students enrolled in different accredited urban and rural schools of India , from Class I to XII , representing an increase of 23 lakh students over 2002 total enrollment , and a 19 % increase in girl 's enrollment . While quantitatively India is inching closer to universal education , the quality of its education has been questioned particularly in its government run school system . Some of the reasons for the poor quality include absence of around 25 % of teachers every day . States of India have introduced tests and education assessment system to identify and improve such schools .
