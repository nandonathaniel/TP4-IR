The Province of Carolina was the second attempted English settlement south of Virginia , the first being the failed attempt at Roanoke . It was a private venture , financed by a group of English Lords Proprietors who obtained a Royal Charter to the Carolinas in 1663 , hoping that a new colony in the south would become profitable like Jamestown . Carolina was not settled until 1670 , and even then the first attempt failed because there was no incentive for emigration to that area . Eventually , however , the Lords combined their remaining capital and financed a settlement mission to the area led by Sir John Colleton . The expedition located fertile and defensible ground at what became Charleston , originally Charles Town for Charles II of England .
