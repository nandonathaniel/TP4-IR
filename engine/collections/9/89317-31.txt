A project audit provides an opportunity to uncover issues , concerns and challenges encountered during the project lifecycle . Conducted midway through the project , an audit affords the project manager , project sponsor and project team an interim view of what has gone well , as well as what needs to be improved to successfully complete the project . If done at the close of a project , the audit can be used to develop success criteria for future projects by providing a forensic review . This review identifies which elements of the project were successfully managed and which ones presented challenges . As a result , the review will help the organisation identify what it needs to do to avoid repeating the same mistakes on future projects
