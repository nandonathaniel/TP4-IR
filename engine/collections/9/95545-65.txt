Although tourism plays a key role in the city 's socioeconomic development , it also has negative impacts on the environment and natural resource base . For example , services associated with tourism , such as travel , the development of infrastructure and its operation , and the production and consumption of goods , are all energy - intensive . Research by the Climate and Development Knowledge Network has identified traditional ' garden houses ' as having the potential to increase tourist traffic and revenue . Apart from the environmental , economic and cultural benefits provided by garden houses , their promotion could pave the way for other low carbon development initiatives .
