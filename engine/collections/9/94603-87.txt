The conditions of enslaved Native Americans varied among the tribes . In many cases , young enslaved captives were adopted into the tribes to replace warriors killed during warfare or by disease . Other tribes practiced debt slavery or imposed slavery on tribal members who had committed crimes ; but , this status was only temporary as the enslaved worked off their obligations to the tribal society .
