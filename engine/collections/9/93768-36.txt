In 1982 , George Eugeniou directed Medea in a Philip Vellacott Penguin translation at Theatro Technis with Angelique Rockas in the title role . Ned Chaillet of The Times is struck by the eruption of the wrath of Medea spurned in `` the dangerous passions of Angelique Rockas '' , and Rosemary Say of The Sunday Telegraph lauds Rockas ' performance as ' fiercely agile ' ( Link to Live performance of Angelique Rockas as Medea ) . As for the production itself , Tom Vaughan of The Morning Star describes it as `` sensitive and eloquent ... fit to stand beside the National 's `` Oresteia '' .
