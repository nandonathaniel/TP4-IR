This practice was made illegal in 1829 during the British colonial rule of India . After gaining independence from British colonial era , India passed a series of additional laws . The Indian Sati Prevention Act from 1988 further criminalised any type of aiding , abetting , and glorifying of sati . In modern India , the last known case of Sati was in 1987 , by Roop Kanwar in Rajasthan . Her action was found to be a suicide , and it led to the arrest and prosecution of people for failing to act and prevent her suicide during her husband 's cremation .
