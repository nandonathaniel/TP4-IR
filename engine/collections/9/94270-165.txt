BBC Radio 1 's chart show had aired the UK Singles Chart exclusively on Sunday afternoons since the programme began ; but this was moved to Fridays in July 2015 . Currently broadcasting from 4 : 00 pm until 5 : 45 pm , the format , length and starting time have varied over the years . For many years , the show prided itself on playing all 40 singles in the top 40 but this practice ended when Wes Butters took over as presenter in 2003 ; then only tracks below number 20 to be played were the new entries . The show took its current format on 10 July 2015 , being presented by Greg James in his usual drive time slot . Random tracks from 40 - 11 are played and then the top 10 are played in full .
