Cells are the basic unit of structure in every living thing , and all cells arise from pre-existing cells by division . Cell theory was formulated by Henri Dutrochet , Theodor Schwann , Rudolf Virchow and others during the early nineteenth century , and subsequently became widely accepted . The activity of an organism depends on the total activity of its cells , with energy flow occurring within and between them . Cells contain hereditary information that is carried forward as a genetic code during cell division .
