The position held by Malthus as professor at the Haileybury training college , to his death in 1834 , gave his theories some influence over Britain 's administration of India . According to Peterson , William Pitt the Younger ( in office : 1783 -- 1801 and 1804 -- 1806 ) , on reading the work of Malthus , withdrew a Bill he had introduced that called for the extension of Poor Relief . Concerns about Malthus 's theory helped promote the idea of a national population census in the UK . Government official John Rickman became instrumental in the carrying out of the first modern British census in 1801 , under Pitt 's administration . In the 1830s Malthus 's writings strongly influenced Whig reforms which overturned Tory paternalism and brought in the Poor Law Amendment Act of 1834 .
