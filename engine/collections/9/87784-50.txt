Influenced by Leibniz , Wundt introduced the term psychophysical parallelism as follows : `` ... wherever there are regular relationships between mental and physical phenomena the two are neither identical nor convertible into one another because they are per se incomparable ; but they are associated with one another in the way that certain mental processes regularly correspond to certain physical processes or , figuratively expressed , run ' parallel to one another ' . '' Although the inner experience is based on the functions of the brain there are no physical causes for mental changes .
