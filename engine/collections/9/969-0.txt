In optics , a real image is an image which is located in the plane of convergence for the light rays that originate from a given object . If a screen is placed in the plane of a real image the image will generally become visible on the screen . Examples of real images include the image seen on a cinema screen ( the source being the projector ) , the image produced on a detector in the rear of a camera , and the image produced on an eyeball retina ( the camera and eye focus light through an internal convex lens ) . In ray diagrams ( such as the images on the right ) , real rays of light are always represented by full , solid lines ; perceived or extrapolated rays of light are represented by dashed lines . A real image occurs where rays converge , whereas a virtual image occurs where rays only appear to converge .
