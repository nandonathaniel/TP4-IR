Recording 300 career wins has been seen as a guaranteed admission to the Baseball Hall of Fame . All pitchers with 300 wins have been elected to the Hall of Fame except for Clemens , who received only half of the vote total needed for induction in his first appearance on the Hall of Fame ballot in 2013 and lost votes from that total in 2014 . Clemens ' future election is seen as uncertain because of his alleged links to use of performance - enhancing drugs . To be eligible for the Hall of Fame , a player must have `` been retired five seasons '' or deceased for at least six months , Many observers expect the club to gain few , if any , members in the foreseeable future . Ten members of the 300 win club are also members of the 3,000 strikeout club .
