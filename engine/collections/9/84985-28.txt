In the books , Owl has a superior but kindly manner towards the others . He can be cross and easily annoyed , especially when his friends ignore or interrupt his long - winded speeches . He sometimes wears reading glasses and he uses his talons for hands , not his wings like in the Disney version . He lives in a tree known as The Chestnuts , described as an `` old world residence of great charm '' . That house is blown down by a storm in the eighth chapter of The House at Pooh Corner . Eeyore eventually discovers what he believes is the perfect new house for Owl , apparently without noticing that it is actually Piglet 's house . Nonetheless , Piglet offers the house to Owl . Owl calls his new home `` The Wolery '' .
