Harper Lee was pleased with the movie , saying : `` In that film the man and the part met ... I 've had many , many offers to turn it into musicals , into TV or stage plays , but I 've always refused . That film was a work of art . '' Peck met Lee 's father , the model for Atticus , before the filming. Lee 's father died before the film 's release , and Lee was so impressed with Peck 's performance that she gave him her father 's pocketwatch , which he had with him the evening he was awarded the Oscar for Best Actor . Years later , he was reluctant to tell Lee that the watch was stolen out of his luggage in London Heathrow Airport . When Peck eventually did tell Lee , he said she responded , `` ' Well , it 's only a watch . ' Harper -- she feels deeply , but she 's not a sentimental person about things . '' Lee and Peck shared a friendship long after the movie was made . Peck 's grandson was named `` Harper '' in her honor .
