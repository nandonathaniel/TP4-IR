The topography of the District of Columbia is very similar to the physical geography of much of Maryland . The District has three major natural flowing bodies of water : the Potomac River and two tributaries , the Anacostia River and Rock Creek . The confluence of the Potomac and Anacostia forms the historic peninsula known as Arsenal Point . The District also includes the Washington Channel , which flows into the junction of the Anacostia and Potomac rivers . There are also three man - made reservoirs : Dalecarlia Reservoir , which crosses over the northwest border of the District from Maryland , McMillan Reservoir near Howard University , and Georgetown Reservoir upstream of Georgetown . A fourth , minor reservoir is at Fort Reno in Tenleytown .
