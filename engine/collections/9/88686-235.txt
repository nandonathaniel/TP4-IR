The only tetrahalides known are the tetrafluorides of cerium , praseodymium , terbium , neodymium and dysprosium , the last two known only under matrix isolation conditions . All of the lanthanides form trihalides with fluorine , chlorine , bromine and iodine . They are all high melting and predominantly ionic in nature . The fluorides are only slightly soluble in water and are not sensitive to air , and this contrasts with the other halides which are air sensitive , readily soluble in water and react at high temperature to form oxohalides . The trihalides were important as pure metal can be prepared from them . In the gas phase the trihalides are planar or approximately planar , the lighter lanthanides have a lower % of dimers , the heavier lanthanides a higher proportion . The dimers have a similar structure to Al Cl .
