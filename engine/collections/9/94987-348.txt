After achieving decisive victory at Liaoshen , Huaihai and Pingjin campaigns , the CPC wiped out 144 regular and 29 non-regular KMT divisions , including 1.54 million veteran KMT troops , which significantly reduced the strength of Nationalist forces . Stalin initially favored a coalition government in postwar China , and tried to persuade Mao to stop the CPC from crossing the Yangtze and attacking the KMT positions south of the river . Mao rejected Stalin 's position and on 21 April , Communist began the Yangtze River Crossing Campaign . On 23 April they captured the KMT 's capital , Nanjing . The KMT government retreated to Canton ( Guangzhou ) until October 15 , Chongqing until November 25 , and then Chengdu before retreating to Taiwan on December 10 . By late 1949 the People 's Liberation Army was pursuing remnants of KMT forces southwards in southern China , and only Tibet was left . In addition , the Ili Rebellion was a Soviet - backed revolt by the Second East Turkestan Republic against the KMT from 1944 -- 49 , as the Mongolians in the People 's Republic were in a border dispute with the Republic of China . A Chinese Muslim Hui cavalry regiment , the 14th Tungan Cavalry , was sent by the Chinese government to attack Mongol and Soviet positions along the border during the Pei - ta - shan Incident .
