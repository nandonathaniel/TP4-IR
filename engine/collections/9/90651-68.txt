The beginnings of Mayan culture date from the development of Kaminaljuyu , in the Highlands of Guatemala , during the middle Preclassic period . According to Richard D. Hansen and others researchers , the first true political states in Mesoamerica consisted of Takalik Abaj , in the Pacific Lowlands , and the cities of El Mirador , Nakbe , Cival and San Bartolo , among others , in the Mirador Basin and Peten . Archaeologists believe that this development happened centuries later , around the 1st century BCE , but recent research in the Petén basin and Belize have proven them wrong . The archaeological evidence indicates that the Maya never formed a united empire ; they were instead organized into small chiefdoms that were constantly at war . López Austin and López Luján have said that the Preclassic Maya were characterized by their bellicose nature . They probably had a greater mastery of the art of war than Teotihuacan , yet the idea that they were a peaceful society given to religious contemplation , which persists to this day , was particularly promoted by early - and mid-20th century Mayanists such as Sylvanus G. Morley and J. Eric S. Thompson . Confirmation that the Maya practiced human sacrifice and ritual cannibalism came much later ( e.g. by the murals of Bonampak ) .
