In its role as the central bank of the United States , the Fed serves as a banker 's bank and as the government 's bank . As the banker 's bank , it helps to assure the safety and efficiency of the payments system . As the government 's bank or fiscal agent , the Fed processes a variety of financial transactions involving trillions of dollars . Just as an individual might keep an account at a bank , the U.S. Treasury keeps a checking account with the Federal Reserve , through which incoming federal tax deposits and outgoing government payments are handled . As part of this service relationship , the Fed sells and redeems U.S. government securities such as savings bonds and Treasury bills , notes and bonds . It also issues the nation 's coin and paper currency . The U.S. Treasury , through its Bureau of the Mint and Bureau of Engraving and Printing , actually produces the nation 's cash supply and , in effect , sells the paper currency to the Federal Reserve Banks at manufacturing cost , and the coins at face value . The Federal Reserve Banks then distribute it to other financial institutions in various ways . During the Fiscal Year 2013 , the Bureau of Engraving and Printing delivered 6.6 billion notes at an average cost of 5.0 cents per note .
