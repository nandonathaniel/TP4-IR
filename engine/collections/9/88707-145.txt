Many ERA supporters blamed their defeat on special interest forces , especially the insurance industry and conservative organizations , suggesting they funded an opposition that subverted the democratic process and the will of the pro-ERA majority . They argued that while the public face of the anti-ERA movement was Phyllis Schlafly and her STOP ERA organization , there were other important groups in the opposition as well , such as the powerful National Council of Catholic Women , labor feminists , and ( until 1973 ) the AFL -- CIO . Opposition to the amendment was particularly high among religious conservatives , who argued that the amendment would guarantee universal abortion rights and the right for homosexual couples to marry . Critchlow and Stachecki say the anti-ERA movement was based on strong support among Southern whites , Evangelical Christians , Mormons , Orthodox Jews , and Roman Catholics , including both men and women . Sonia Johnson , a traditionally - raised Mormon housewife whose eventual feminist advocacy for the ERA 's passage led to her excommunication by the LDS church , subsequently wrote about her experiences in the memoir From Housewife to Heretic . ( Johnson and others led a hunger strike / fast at the Illinois State Senate building in an effort to push the Illinois General Assembly toward ratification before the 1982 revised deadline . )
