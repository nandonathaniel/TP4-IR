It is thought that there are several different types of El Niño events , with the canonical eastern Pacific and the Modoki central Pacific types being the two that receive the most attention . These different types of El Niño events are classified by where the tropical Pacific sea surface temperature ( SST ) anomalies are the largest . For example , the strongest sea surface temperature anomalies associated with the canonical eastern Pacific event are located off the coast of South America . The strongest anomalies associated with the Modoki central Pacific event are located near the International Dateline . However , during the duration of a single event , the area with the greatest sea surface temperature anomalies can change .
