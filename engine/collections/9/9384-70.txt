Fertilizer recommendations are in the range of the nutrient removal . Organic fertilizer must be applied before sowing due to the short cultivation time of napa cabbage and the slow availability of organic fertilizers . Synthetic N fertilizer should be applied in 3 equal doses . The last application must happen before 2 / 3 of the cultivation time is over to avoid quality losses during storage .
