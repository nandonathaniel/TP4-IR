During the Christmas music special of Beavis and Butt - head , one of the incidental bits of music they hear is the Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy , at which Beavis is impressed ( saying it 's like Ozzy ) and he even chants along to the tune before humming Iron Man . The song also appears in the episode The Mystery Of Morning Wood while they sleep and the Morning Wood Fairy comes out of the TV .
