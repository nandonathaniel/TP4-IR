Scientists assume an attitude of openness and accountability on the part of those conducting an experiment . Detailed record keeping is essential , to aid in recording and reporting on the experimental results , and supports the effectiveness and integrity of the procedure . They will also assist in reproducing the experimental results , likely by others . Traces of this approach can be seen in the work of Hipparchus ( 190 -- 120 BCE ) , when determining a value for the precession of the Earth , while controlled experiments can be seen in the works of Jābir ibn Hayyān ( 721 -- 815 CE ) , al - Battani ( 853 -- 929 ) and Alhazen ( 965 -- 1039 ) .
