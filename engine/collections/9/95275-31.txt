The development of Lilo 's ʻohana ( extended family ) begins with the adoption of Stitch in Lilo & Stitch . Though Lilo technically owns Stitch by Hawaiian state law , the relationship between the two is more like siblings and best friends . By the end of the series , Lilo 's extended ʻohana includes Nani , `` Uncle '' Jumba and `` Aunt '' Pleakley , David , Cobra Bubbles , the Grand Councilwoman , Victoria , all 627 ( 627 and 628 were shown dehydrated in the episode of 627 , although it could be argued that they still count ) of Stitch 's `` cousins '' , Gantu and finally Mertle .
