The Jesuits were another major contributor to the development of pendulum clocks in the 17th and 18th centuries , having had an `` unusually keen appreciation of the importance of precision '' . In measuring an accurate one - second pendulum , for example , the Italian astronomer Father Giovanni Battista Riccioli persuaded nine fellow Jesuits `` to count nearly 87,000 oscillations in a single day '' . They served a crucial role in spreading and testing the scientific ideas of the period , and collaborated with contemporary scientists , such as Huygens .
