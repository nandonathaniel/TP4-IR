The following four years would be the only time that the president and vice-president were from different parties ( John Quincy Adams and John C. Calhoun would later be elected president and vice-president as political opponents , but they were both Democratic - Republican party candidates ; Andrew Johnson , Abraham Lincoln 's second vice-president , was a Democrat , but Lincoln ran on a combined National Union Party ticket in 1864 , not as a strict Republican ) . Jefferson would leverage his position as vice-president to attack President Adams 's policies , and this would help him reach the White House in the following election .
