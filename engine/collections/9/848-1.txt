A guiding principle of GAMLSS is how to learn from data generated in many fields . In particular , the GAMLSS statistical framework enables flexible regression and smoothing models to be fitted to the data . The GAMLSS model assumes that the distribution of response variable has any parametric distribution which might be heavy or light - tailed , and positively or negatively skewed . In addition , all the parameters of the distribution ( location ( e.g. , mean ) , scale ( e.g. , variance ) and shape ( skewness and kurtosis ) ) can be modelled as linear , nonlinear or smooth functions of explanatory variables .
