The referendum debate and campaign was an unusual time in British politics and was the third national vote to be held in seventeen months . During the campaign , the Labour Cabinet was split and its members campaigned on each side of the question , an unprecedented breach of Cabinet collective responsibility . Most votes in the House of Commons in preparation for the referendum were only carried thanks to opposition support , and the Government faced several defeats on technical issues such as the handling and format of the referendum counts . Finally , although the Government declared in advance that it would comply with the result , the referendum itself was not legally binding upon it .
