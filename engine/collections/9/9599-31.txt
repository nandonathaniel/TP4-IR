The first recorded visit to the islands happened by chance in 1535 , when Fray Tomás de Berlanga , the Bishop of Panamá , was surprised with this undiscovered land during a voyage to Peru to arbitrate in a dispute between Francisco Pizarro and Diego de Almagro . De Berlanga eventually returned to the Spanish Empire and described the conditions of the islands and the animals that inhabited them . The group of islands was shown and named in Abraham Ortelius 's atlas published in 1570 . The first crude map of the islands was made in 1684 by the buccaneer Ambrose Cowley , who named the individual islands after some of his fellow pirates or after British royalty and noblemen . These names were used in the authoritative navigation charts of the islands prepared during the Beagle survey under captain Robert Fitzroy , and in Darwin 's popular book The Voyage of the Beagle . The new Republic of Ecuador took the islands from Spanish ownership in 1832 , and subsequently gave them official Spanish names . The older names remained in use in English language publications , including Herman Melville 's The Encantadas of 1854 .
