The Xochimilcas were farmers and founded their first dominion under a leader named Acatonallo . He is credited with inventing the chinampa system of agriculture to increase production . These chinampas eventually became the main producer with crops such as corn , beans , chili peppers , squash and more . The city of Xochimilco was founded in 919 . Over time , it grew and began to dominate other areas on the south side of the lakes such as Mixquic , Tl√°huac , Culhuacan and even parts of what is now the State of Morelos . Xochimilco had one woman ruler , which did not happen anywhere else in Mesoamerica in the pre-Hispanic period . She is credited with adding a number of distinctive dishes to the area 's cuisine , with inclusions such as necuatolli , chileatolli ( atole with chili pepper ) , esquites and tlapiques .
