The mode of most `` absurdist '' plays is tragicomedy . As Nell says in Endgame , `` Nothing is funnier than unhappiness ... it 's the most comical thing in the world '' . Esslin cites William Shakespeare as an influence on this aspect of the `` Absurd drama . '' Shakespeare 's influence is acknowledged directly in the titles of Ionesco 's Macbett and Stoppard 's Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead . Friedrich DÃ¼rrenmatt says in his essay `` Problems of the Theatre '' , `` Comedy alone is suitable for us ... But the tragic is still possible even if pure tragedy is not . We can achieve the tragic out of comedy . We can bring it forth as a frightening moment , as an abyss that opens suddenly ; indeed , many of Shakespeare 's tragedies are already really comedies out of which the tragic arises . ''
