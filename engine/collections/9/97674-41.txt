Released in March 1963 , the album initiated a run during which eleven of their twelve studio albums released in the United Kingdom through 1970 reached number one . The band 's third single , `` From Me to You '' , came out in April and was also a chart - topping hit , starting an almost unbroken string of seventeen British number - one singles for the Beatles , including all but one of the eighteen they released over the next six years . Issued in August , the band 's fourth single , `` She Loves You '' , achieved the fastest sales of any record in the UK up to that time , selling three - quarters of a million copies in under four weeks . It became their first single to sell a million copies , and remained the biggest - selling record in the UK until 1978 . Their commercial success brought increased media exposure , to which the Beatles responded with an irreverent and comical attitude that defied the expectations of pop musicians at the time , inspiring even more interest . The band toured the UK three times in the first half of the year : a four - week tour that began in February , the Beatles ' first nationwide , preceded three - week tours in March and May -- June . As their popularity spread , a frenzied adulation of the group took hold . Greeted with riotous enthusiasm by screaming fans , the press dubbed the phenomenon `` Beatlemania '' . Although not billed as tour leaders , the Beatles overshadowed American acts Tommy Roe and Chris Montez during the February engagements and assumed top billing `` by audience demand '' , something no British act had previously accomplished while touring with artists from the US . A similar situation arose during their May -- June tour with Roy Orbison .
