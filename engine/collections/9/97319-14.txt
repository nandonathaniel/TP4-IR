Keohane and Lisa L. Martin expound upon these ideas in the mid 1990s as a response to John J. Mearsheimer 's `` The False Promise of International Institutions , '' where Mearsheimer purports that , `` institutions can not get states to stop behaving as short - term power maximizers . '' In fact Mearsheimer 's article is a direct response to the liberal - institutionalist movement created in response to neo-realism . The central point in Keohane and Martin 's idea is that neo-realism insists that , `` institutions have only marginal effects ... ( which ) leaves ( neo-realism ) without a plausible account of the investments that states have made in such international institutions as the EU , NATO , GATT , and regional trading organizations . '' This idea is in keeping with the notion of complex interdependence . Moreover , Keohane and Martin argue that the fact that international institutions are created in response to state interests , that the real empirical question is `` knowing how to distinguish the effects of underlying conditions from those of the institutions themselves . '' The debate between the institutionalists and Mearsheimer is about whether institutions have an independent effect on state behavior , or whether they reflect great power interests that said powers employ to advance their respective interests .
