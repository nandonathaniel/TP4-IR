The KGB had also helped developed the signals intelligence capabilities of the North Vietnamese , through an operation known as Vostok ( also known as Phương Đông , meaning `` Orient '' and named after the Vostok 1 ) . The Vostok program was a counterintelligence and espionage program . These programs helped proved pivotal in detecting and defeating CIA and South Vietnamese commando teams sent into North Vietnam , as they were detected and captured . Soviet - assistance had helped the Ministry of Public Security come into its own as it had recruited foreigners within high - level diplomatic circles among the Western - allies of the US , under a clandestine program known as `` B12 , MM '' which produced thousands of high - level documents for nearly a decade , including targets of B - 52 strikes . In 1975 , the SIGINT services had broken information from Western US - allies in Saigon , determining that the US would not intervene to save South Vietnam from collapse .
