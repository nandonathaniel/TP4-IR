The requirement for a client - side certificate , however unpopular it may be , is what gives EAP - TLS its authentication strength and illustrates the classic convenience vs. security trade - off . With a client - side certificate , a compromised password is not enough to break into EAP - TLS enabled systems because the intruder still needs to have the client - side certificate ; indeed , a password is not even needed , as it is only used to encrypt the client - side certificate for storage . The highest security available is when the `` private keys '' of client - side certificate are housed in smart cards . This is because there is no way to steal a client - side certificate 's corresponding private key from a smart card without stealing the card itself . It is more likely that the physical theft of a smart card would be noticed ( and the smart card immediately revoked ) than a ( typical ) password theft would be noticed . In addition , the private key on a smart card is typically encrypted using a PIN that only the owner of the smart card knows , minimizing its utility for a thief even before the card has been reported stolen and revoked .
