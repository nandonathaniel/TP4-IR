Islam teaches that everyone is Muslim at birth but the parents or society can cause them to deviate from the straight path . When someone accepts Islam , they are considered to revert to the original condition . In Islam , circumcision is a Sunnah custom not mentioned in the Qur'an . The majority clerical opinion holds that circumcision is not a condition for entering Islam . The Shafi ` i and Hanbali schools regard it as obligatory , while the Maliki and Hanafi schools regard it as only recommended . However , it is not a precondition for the acceptance of a person 's Islamic practices , nor is choosing to forgo circumcision considered a sin . It is not one of the Five Pillars of Islam .
