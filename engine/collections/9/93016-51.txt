In A Game of Thrones ( 1996 ) , Bran accidentally sees Queen Cersei Lannister and her brother Ser Jaime having sex ; whereupon he is pushed from the window by Jaime to keep the incest a secret , but he survives in a coma . While Bran remains unconscious , an attempt is made on his life , and Catelyn delays the assassin long enough for Bran 's direwolf , Summer , to kill him . Senseless , Bran dreams of his falling from the tower and of a three - eyed crow that offers to teach him to fly . With the crow 's guidance , Bran wakes ; but having been crippled by the fall , he is unable to walk . Thereafter he relies on the giant simpleton Hodor , and a harness designed by Tyrion Lannister , to move . When Robb rides south to relieve Ned 's arrest in King 's Landing , Bran becomes the acting Lord of Winterfell .
