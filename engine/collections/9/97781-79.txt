SLI batteries ( starting , lighting , ignition ; i.e. , car batteries ) suffer most deterioration because vehicles normally stand unused for relatively long periods of time . Deep cycle and motive power batteries are subjected to regular controlled overcharging , eventually failing due to corrosion of the positive plate grids rather than sulfation .
