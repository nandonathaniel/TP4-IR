Women may have been playing `` football '' for as long as the game has existed . Evidence shows that an ancient version of the game ( Tsu Chu ) was played by women during the Han Dynasty ( 25 -- 220 CE ) . Two female figures are depicted in Han Dynasty ( 25 -- 220 CE ) frescoes , playing Tsu Chu . There are , however , a number of opinions about the accuracy of dates , the earliest estimates at 5000 BCE .
