For its 12th season ( 2007 -- 08 ) , Judge Judy averaged a 4.8 rating ( 4.8 HH AA % / 7.4 HH GAA % rating ) and 9.9 million average daily viewers . Judy was the only first - run syndication program to increase in ratings for that season from the previous , leading CBS to immediately extend her contract through the 2012 -- 13 season . For its 13th season ( 2008 -- 09 ) , the show averaged a 4.2 rating ( 4.2 HH AA % / 6.5 HH GAA % rating ) and 9.02 million average daily viewers . Its 14th season ( 2009 -- 10 ) marked the first season in nearly a decade since the 2000 -- 01 season that any daytime television program had been able to surpass The Oprah Winfrey Show 's ratings ( Judge Judy is also the show in question that during the 2000 -- 01 television season surpassed The Oprah Winfrey Show in daytime TV ratings ) : Judy broke Winfrey 's near decade - long streak with a 4.4 rating ( 4.4 HH AA % / 6.9 HH GAA % rating ) and 9.6 million average daily viewers . It was also at that point that Sheindlin 's courtroom series became the highest rated show in all of daytime television programming . Judy secured this title in its 15th season ( 2010 -- 11 ) as the program remained ahead of Oprah in her ( Oprah ) final season and the highest - rated daytime television offering , averaging a 5.11 rating and 9.6 million viewers . During this season , Judy also became the highest rated show in first - run syndication . Late that same season in May 2011 , as a result of continued high ratings , CBS again extended Sheindlin 's contract , this time through the 2014 -- 15 season ( the show 's 19th ) .
