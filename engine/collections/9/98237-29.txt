The band faced several challenges in writing their second album , October . On an otherwise successful American leg of the Boy Tour , Bono 's briefcase containing in - progress lyrics and musical ideas was lost backstage during a March 1981 performance at a nightclub in Portland , Oregon . The band had limited time to write new music on tour and in July began a two - month recording session at Windmill Lane Studios largely unprepared , forcing Bono to quickly improvise lyrics . Lillywhite , reprising his role as producer , called the sessions `` completely chaotic and mad '' . October 's lead single , `` Fire '' , was released in July and was U2 's first song to chart in the UK . Despite garnering the band an appearance on UK television programme Top of the Pops , the single fell in the charts afterwards . On 16 August 1981 , the group opened for Thin Lizzy at the inaugural Slane Concert , but the Edge called it `` one of the worst shows ( U2 ) ever played in ( their ) lives '' . Adding to this period of self - doubt , Bono 's , the Edge 's , and Mullen 's involvement in a Charismatic Christian group in Dublin called the `` Shalom Fellowship '' led them to question the relationship between their religious faith and the lifestyle of a rock band . Bono and the Edge considered quitting the band due to their perceived spiritual conflicts before deciding to leave Shalom instead .
