The use of BMW 's then - new line of retro - styled Minis in the film was mentioned by critics and business analysts alike as a prime example of modern product placement , or more specifically `` brand integration '' . Film critic Joe Morgenstern called The Italian Job `` the best car commercial ever '' . Zacharek and Mathews both noted the cars ' prominence in their reviews of the film , also writing that their presence served as a connection to the 1969 film upon which it was based . BusinessWeek reported in April 2004 that sales of the Mini in 2003 -- the year in which The Italian Job was theatrically released -- had increased 22 percent over the previous year .
