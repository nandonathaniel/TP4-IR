When the UK Kennel accepted registrations in 1919 , 54 German Shepherds were registered . By 1926 this number had grown to over 8,000 . The breed gained international recognition after the decline of World War I. Returning soldiers spoke highly of the breed and animal actors Rin Tin Tin and Strongheart popularised the breed further . The first German Shepherd Dog registered in the United States was Queen of Switzerland . Her offspring suffered from defects as the result of poor breeding , which caused the breed to suffer a decline in popularity during the late 1920s .
