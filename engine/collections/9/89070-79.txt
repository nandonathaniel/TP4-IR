In 2011 , during Exercise Talisman Sabre , a protester made his way onto the tarmac at Rockhampton Airport and attacked a $36 million Tiger helicopter with a garden mattock . The man was ordered to stand trial charged with wilful damage and threatening an aircraft but died before the matter went to trial .
