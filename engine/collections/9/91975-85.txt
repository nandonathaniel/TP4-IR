Band manager Doug Goldstein stated in November 1999 that the band had ' almost finished ' recording the music , and the album was due out some time in 2000 . Later that month , the band released a new song , the industrial styled `` Oh My God '' , which was included on the soundtrack of the film End of Days . The track featured additional guitar work by Dave Navarro and Gary Sunshine , Rose 's personal guitar teacher . Rose claimed that former members Duff McKagan and Matt Sorum had ' failed to see the potential ' of the song and had no interest in recording or playing the piece .
