The tax base is adjusted gross income reduced by a fixed deduction that varies by taxpayer filing status . Itemized deductions of individuals are limited to home mortgage interest , charitable contributions , and a portion of medical expenses . AMT is imposed at a rate of 26 % or 28 % for individuals and 20 % for corporations , less the amount of regular tax . A credit against future regular income tax is allowed for such excess , with certain restrictions .
