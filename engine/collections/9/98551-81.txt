Spinal cord injuries can be caused by trauma to the spinal column ( stretching , bruising , applying pressure , severing , laceration , etc . ) . The vertebral bones or intervertebral disks can shatter , causing the spinal cord to be punctured by a sharp fragment of bone . Usually , victims of spinal cord injuries will suffer loss of feeling in certain parts of their body . In milder cases , a victim might only suffer loss of hand or foot function . More severe injuries may result in paraplegia , tetraplegia ( also known as quadriplegia ) , or full body paralysis below the site of injury to the spinal cord .
