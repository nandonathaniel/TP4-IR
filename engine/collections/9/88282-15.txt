The nail bed is the skin beneath the nail plate . Like all skin , it is made of two types of tissues : the deeper dermis , the living tissue which includes capillaries and glands , and the epidermis , the layer just beneath the nail plate , which moves toward the finger tip with the plate . The epidermis is attached to the dermis by tiny longitudinal `` grooves '' called matrix crests ( cristae matricis unguis ) . In old age , the nail plate becomes thinner , and these grooves become more visible .
