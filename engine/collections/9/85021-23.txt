Despite this second set of arrests , Chartist activity continued . Beginning in 1843 , O'Connor suggested that the land contained the solution to workers ' problems . This idea evolved into the Chartist Co-operative Land Company , later called the National Land Company . Workers would buy shares in the company , and the company would use those funds to purchase estates that would be subdivided into 2 , 3 , and 4 acre ( 8,000 , 12,400 and 16,000 m2 ) lots . Between 1844 and 1848 , five estates were purchased , subdivided , and built on , and then settled by lucky shareholders , who were chosen by lot . Unfortunately for O'Connor , in 1848 a Select Committee was appointed by Parliament to investigate the financial viability of the scheme , and it was ordered that it be shut down . Cottages built by the Chartist Land Company are still standing and inhabited today in Oxfordshire , Worcestershire , Gloucestershire and on the outskirts of London . Rosedene , a Chartist cottage in Dodford , Worcestershire , is owned and maintained by the National Trust , and is open to visitors by appointment .
