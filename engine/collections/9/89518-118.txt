Cistercian monasteries , in particular , made extensive use of water wheels to power watermills of many kinds . An early example of a very large water wheel is the still extant wheel at the early 13th century Real Monasterio de Nuestra Senora de Rueda , a Cistercian monastery in the Aragon region of Spain . Grist mills ( for corn ) were undoubtedly the most common , but there were also sawmills , fulling mills and mills to fulfil many other labour - intensive tasks . The water wheel remained competitive with the steam engine well into the Industrial Revolution . At around the 8th to 10th century , a number of irrigation technologies were brought into Spain and thus introduced to Europe . One of those technologies is the Noria , which is basically a wheel fitted with buckets on the peripherals for lifting water . It is similar to the undershot water wheel mentioned later in this article . It allowed peasants to power watermills more efficiently . According to Thomas Glick 's book , Irrigation and Society in Medieval Valencia , the Noria probably originated from somewhere in Persia . It has been used for centuries before the technology was brought into Spain by Arabs who had adopted it from the Romans . Thus the distribution of the Noria in the Iberian peninsula `` conforms to the area of stabilized Islamic settlement '' . This technology has a profound effect on the life of peasants . The Noria is relatively cheap to build . Thus it allowed peasants to cultivate land more efficiently in Europe . Together with the Spaniards , the technology spread to the New World in Mexico and South America following Spanish expansion .
