Jimmy is based on one of his cousins , who was rather feminine and spent most of his time playing with girls rather than with boys . Jonny and Plank are inspired by one of Antonucci 's childhood friends , a loner who spent most of his time outside with his blanket . He stated that he believed it was important to add Plank , a board of wood , to the show , and that he `` thought it would be really cool to do the show with Plank taking on a character of his own '' and to cause Jonny to do things he would usually never do . Some wanted Plank to be able to talk , smile and blink as if he was alive , but Antonucci insisted that it should be treated as a piece of wood , brought to life by Jonny 's imagination .
