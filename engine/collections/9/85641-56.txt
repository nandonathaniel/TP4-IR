The Episcopal Church was active in the Social Gospel movement of the late 19th and early 20th centuries . Since the 1960s and 1970s , the church has pursued a decidedly more liberal course . It has opposed the death penalty and supported the civil rights movement and affirmative action . Some of its leaders and priests are known for marching with influential civil rights ' demonstrators such as Martin Luther King Jr . The Church calls for the full legal equality of gay and lesbian people , a movement partly inspired by their similar call for racial equality during the mid-1950s . In 2015 , the Church 's 78th annual General Convention passed resolutions allowing the blessing of same - sex marriages and approved two official liturgies to bless such unions , though they are not yet official rites within the Book of Common Prayer . Due to the complex process of editing or making additions to the Prayer Book , the BCP still describes marriage as being the union of a man and a woman .
