sutor , ne ultra crepidam Cobbler , no further than the sandal ! Thus , do n't offer your opinion on things that are outside your competence .

When the cobbler started offering advice on other parts of the painting , Apelles rebuked him with this phrase in Greek , and it subsequently became a popular Latin expression .
