The term `` probiotic '' originally referred to microorganisms that have effects on other microorganisms . The conception of probiotics involved the notion that substances secreted by one microorganism stimulated the growth of another microorganism . The term was used again to describe tissue extracts which stimulated microbial growth . The term probiotics was taken up by Parker , who defined the concept as , `` organisms and substances that have a beneficial effect on the host animal by contributing to its intestinal microbial balance '' . Later , the definition was greatly improved by Fuller , whose explanation was very close to the definition used today . Fuller described probiotics as a `` live microbial feed supplement which beneficially affects the host animal by improving its intestinal microbial balance '' . He stressed two important facts of probiotics : the viable nature of probiotics and the capacity to help with intestinal balance .
