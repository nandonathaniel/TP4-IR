The scene was also a pivotal point in the development of Elsa 's character and was initially planned to depict her becoming evil . Robert Lopez , who composed the song with his wife , Kristen Anderson - Lopez , explained , `` Elsa was going to go from being this perfect princess that had tried to keep her personality down her whole life to saying , ' Screw it . I 'm gon na be me . ' '' They had wanted to use the song as a way to gain a better understanding of the character and what she would be like if she was no longer living in fear , which ultimately resulted in her becoming much more complex . The final lyrics and Menzel 's `` ability to be so fragile and vulnerable and then break into this powerhouse voice '' turned the plot around and led to Elsa being revised as a `` good '' character . She initially attempts to suppress her powers in order to avoid hurting others , particularly Anna , and when she is no longer able to do so , she banishes herself from the kingdom to protect those around her . Lead writer Paul Briggs said that Anna 's support is what Elsa needs most when her secret is exposed . `` The strength of the family bond is what makes this story so powerful , '' he explained , `` because it 's her sibling who 's willing to look beyond her powers and stand between her and the world if that 's what it takes .
