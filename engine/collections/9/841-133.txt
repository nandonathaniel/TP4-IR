In some regions , most notably in Awadh , the rebellion took on the attributes of a patriotic revolt against European presence and power . However , the rebel leaders proclaimed no articles of faith that presaged a new political system . Even so , the rebellion proved to be an important watershed in Indian - and British Empire history . It led to the dissolution of the East India Company , and forced the British to reorganize the army , the financial system , and the administration in India , through the passage of the Government of India Act 1858 . India was thereafter administered directly by the British government in the new British Raj . On 1 November 1858 , Queen Victoria issued a proclamation to Indians , which while lacking the authority of a constitutional provision , promised rights similar to those of other British subjects . In the following decades , when admission to these rights was not always forthcoming , Indians were to pointedly refer to the Queen 's proclamation in growing avowals of a new nationalism .
