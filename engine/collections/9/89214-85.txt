In 1562 French Huguenots established a settlement at what is now the Charlesfort - Santa Elena archaeological site on Parris Island . The garrison lacks supplies and the soldiers , as in the same time in the France Antarctique , run away , some settlers preferring the savagering and a `` natural '' life far from the `` civilization '' and the atrocities of the Wars of Religion . In May 1564 , a second expedition explore the shore from `` Jordan River '' up to `` Dolphins river '' and takes possession of the territory from the coast to the `` Palassi Mountains '' , middle French transcription of Appalachian Mountains . On June 20 , 1564 , they founded Fort Caroline , so called in honour of the King of France Charles IX .
