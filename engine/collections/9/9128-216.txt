District of Columbia Public Schools ( DCPS ) operates the city 's 123 public schools . The number of students in DCPS steadily decreased for 39 years until 2009 . In the 2010 -- 11 school year , 46,191 students were enrolled in the public school system . DCPS has one of the highest - cost yet lowest - performing school systems in the country , both in terms of infrastructure and student achievement . Mayor Adrian Fenty 's administration made sweeping changes to the system by closing schools , replacing teachers , firing principals , and using private education firms to aid curriculum development .
