The surface temperature of Earth has been relatively constant through geologic time despite varying levels of incoming solar radiation ( insolation ) , indicating that a dynamic process governs Earth 's temperature via a combination of greenhouse gases and surface or atmospheric albedo . This proposal is known as the Gaia hypothesis .
