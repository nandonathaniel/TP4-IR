Although originally charged with guarding India 's external boundaries , the BSF has more recently been given the task of counter-insurgency and counter-terrorism operations . When the insurgency in Jammu and Kashmir broke out in 1989 , the Jammu and Kashmir state police and the thinly - deployed Central Reserve Police Force ( CRPF ) needed extra force to cope with the spiralling violence , the Indian government deployed the BSF to Jammu and Kashmir to combat Kashmiri militants .
