In his later years , Brezhnev developed his own cult of personality , and awarded himself the highest military decorations of the Soviet Union . The media extolled Brezhnev `` as a dynamic leader and intellectual colossus '' . Brezhnev was awarded a Lenin Prize for Literature for Brezhnev 's trilogy , three auto - biographical novels . These awards were given to Brezhnev to bolster his position within the Party and the Politburo . When Alexei Kosygin died on 18 December 1980 , one day before Brezhnev 's birthday , Pravda and other media outlets postponed the reporting of his death until after Brezhnev 's birthday celebration . In reality , however , Brezhnev 's physical and intellectual capacities had started to decline in the 1970s from bad health .
