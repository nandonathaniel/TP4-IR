Headey co-starred with Matt Damon and Heath Ledger in Terry Gilliam 's The Brothers Grimm , which was released in August 2005 . The film received mixed reviews . In an interview Headey spoke about her character in the film : `` I loved the fact that she was a tomboy . That is what attracted me to her , that she was n't this predictable female character in this big film . You meet her and she is masking who she is . I loved that her environment dictated who she is . She lives and grows up and survives in the forest . Terry and I talked about how her instincts are almost animalistic and she can see 360 degrees around her . She is aware of what is going on . That is how she is grounded . She is of the earth '' .
