US policy in post-war Germany from April 1945 until July 1947 had been that no help should be given to the Germans in rebuilding their nation , save for the minimum required to mitigate starvation . The Allies ' immediate post-war `` industrial disarmament '' plan for Germany had been to destroy Germany 's capability to wage war by complete or partial de-industrialization . The first industrial plan for Germany , signed in 1946 , required the destruction of 1,500 manufacturing plants to lower German heavy industry output to roughly 50 % of its 1938 level . Dismantling of West German industry ended in 1951 . By 1950 , equipment had been removed from 706 manufacturing plants , and steel production capacity had been reduced by 6.7 million tons . After lobbying by the Joint Chiefs of Staff and Generals Lucius D. Clay and George Marshall , the Truman administration accepted that economic recovery in Europe could not go forward without the reconstruction of the German industrial base on which it had previously been dependent . In July 1947 , President Truman rescinded on `` national security grounds '' the directive that had ordered the US occupation forces to `` take no steps looking toward the economic rehabilitation of Germany . '' A new directive recognised that `` ( a ) n orderly , prosperous Europe requires the economic contributions of a stable and productive Germany . '' From mid-1946 onwards Germany received US government aid through the GARIOA programme . From 1948 onwards West Germany also became a minor beneficiary of the Marshall Plan . Volunteer organisations had initially been forbidden to send food , but in early 1946 the Council of Relief Agencies Licensed to Operate in Germany was founded . The prohibition against sending CARE Packages to individuals in Germany was rescinded on 5 June 1946 ,
