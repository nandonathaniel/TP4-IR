At its peak the colony consisted of two settlements . The Eastern was at the southwestern tip of Greenland , while the Western Settlement was about 500 km up the west coast , inland from present - day Nuuk . A smaller settlement near the Eastern Settlement is sometimes considered the Middle Settlement . The combined population was around 2,000 -- 3,000 . At least 400 farms have been identified by archaeologists . Norse Greenland had a bishopric ( at Garðar ) and exported walrus ivory , furs , rope , sheep , whale or seal blubber , live animals such as polar bears , supposed `` unicorn horns '' ( in reality narwhal tusks ) , and cattle hides . In 1126 , the population requested a Bishop ( headquartered at Garðar ) , and in 1261 , they accepted the overlordship of the Norwegian King . They continued to have their own law and became almost completely independent after 1349 , the time of the Black Death . In 1380 , the Norwegian Kingdom entered into a personal union with the Kingdom of Denmark .
