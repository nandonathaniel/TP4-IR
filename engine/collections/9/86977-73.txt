In general global response to DNA damage involves expression of multiple genes responsible for postreplication repair , homologous recombination , nucleotide excision repair , DNA damage checkpoint , global transcriptional activation , genes controlling mRNA decay , and many others . A large amount of damage to a cell leaves it with an important decision : undergo apoptosis and die , or survive at the cost of living with a modified genome . An increase in tolerance to damage can lead to an increased rate of survival that will allow a greater accumulation of mutations . Yeast Rev1 and human polymerase Î· are members of ( Y family translesion DNA polymerases present during global response to DNA damage and are responsible for enhanced mutagenesis during a global response to DNA damage in eukaryotes .
