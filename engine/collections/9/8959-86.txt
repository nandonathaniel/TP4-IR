In 1947 , the Saar Protectorate had been established under French control , in the area corresponding to the current German state of Saarland . It was not allowed to join its fellow German neighbors until a plebiscite in 1955 rejected the proposed autonomy . This paved the way for the accession of the Saarland to the Federal Republic of Germany as its 12th state , which went into effect on 1 January 1957 .
