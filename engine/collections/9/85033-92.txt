Non-military officials and people on official business had no legion at their service and the government maintained way stations , or mansiones ( `` staying places '' ) , for their use . Passports were required for identification . Mansiones were located about 25 to 30 kilometres ( 16 to 19 mi ) apart . There the official traveller found a complete villa dedicated to his use . Often a permanent military camp or a town grew up around the mansio . For non-official travelers in need of refreshment , a private system of `` inns '' or cauponae were placed near the mansiones . They performed the same functions but were somewhat disreputable , as they were frequented by thieves and prostitutes . Graffiti decorate the walls of the few whose ruins have been found .
