S - type ( silicate - rich ) asteroids are more common toward the inner region of the belt , within 2.5 AU of the Sun . The spectra of their surfaces reveal the presence of silicates and some metal , but no significant carbonaceous compounds . This indicates that their materials have been significantly modified from their primordial composition , probably through melting and reformation . They have a relatively high albedo , and form about 17 % of the total asteroid population .
