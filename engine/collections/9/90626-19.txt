The Little League World Series consists of 16 teams -- 8 from the United States , and 8 from other countries . Prior to 2001 there were eight teams in the LLWS : four U.S. teams ( Central , South , East , and West ) and four international ( Canada , Latin America , Europe , and the Far East ) . It should be noted that in 1975 there were only four teams in the LLWS , all from the United States . The international teams returned in 1976 . Starting in 1976 , two brackets were established , with the four U.S. regions competing in the U.S. bracket and the four non-U.S. regions competing in the International bracket . The U.S. national champion and the International champion then compete for the World Series title .
