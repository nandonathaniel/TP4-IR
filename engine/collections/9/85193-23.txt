The UCF football program can be traced back to a speech given by the university 's second president , Dr. Trevor Colbourn , in January 1979 . Colbourn believed that a successful athletics program would bring the university greater renown , and tasked Dr. Jack O'Leary with the job of creating a new football program at the school . In addition , Colbourn changed the name of the school to the University of Central Florida ( prior to this , the college was known as Florida Technological University ) , to express the university 's expanded academic scope .
