Conquest theories Similar to the economic stratification theories , the conquest theory contends that a single city establishes a state in order to control other tribes or settlements it has conquered . The theory has its roots in the work of Ibn Khaldun ( 1332 - 1406 ) and of Jean Bodin ( 1530 -- 1596 ) , but it was first organized around anthropological evidence by Franz Oppenheimer ( 1864 - 1943 ) . Oppenheimer argues that the state was created to cement inequality between peoples that resulted from conquest .
