Conversation is generally face - to - face person - to - person at the same time ( synchronous ) -- possibly online with video applications such as Skype , but might also include audio - only phone calls . It would not generally include internet written communication which tends to be asynchronous ( not same time -- can read and respond later if at all ) and does not fit the ' con ' = ' with ' in ' conversation ' . In face to face conversation it has been suggested that 85 % of the communication is non-verbal / body language -- a smile , a frown , a shrug , tone of voice conveying much added meaning to the mere words . Short forms of written communication such as sms are thus frequently misunderstood . Yet the convenience and apparent control makes them increasingly popular now that many people seem to prefer to communicate via short text or Facebook post and / or ' like ' than actually meeting face to face .
