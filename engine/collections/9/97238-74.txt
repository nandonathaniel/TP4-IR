The question particularly intrigued Harry Hammond Hess , a Princeton University geologist and a Naval Reserve Rear Admiral , and Robert S. Dietz , a scientist with the U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey who first coined the term seafloor spreading . Dietz and Hess ( the former published the same idea one year earlier in Nature , but priority belongs to Hess who had already distributed an unpublished manuscript of his 1962 article by 1960 ) were among the small handful who really understood the broad implications of sea floor spreading and how it would eventually agree with the , at that time , unconventional and unaccepted ideas of continental drift and the elegant and mobilistic models proposed by previous workers like Holmes .
