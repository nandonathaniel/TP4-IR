Demonstrative examples of the sound of a solo double bass and its technical use in jazz can be heard on the solo recordings Emerald Tears ( 1978 ) by Dave Holland or Emergence ( 1986 ) by Miroslav Vitous . Holland also recorded an album with the representative title Music from Two Basses ( 1971 ) on which he plays with Barre Phillips while he sometimes switches to cello .
