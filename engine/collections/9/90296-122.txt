Because most parties opposed the new government , Papen had the Reichstag dissolved and called for new elections . The general elections on 31 July 1932 yielded major gains for the Communists , and for the Nazis , who won 37.3 % of the vote -- their high - water mark in a free election . The Nazi party then supplanted the Social Democrats as the largest party in the Reichstag , although it did not gain a majority .
