The NHC began monitoring a disorganized area of low pressure in the deep tropical Pacific Ocean on July 24 for tropical cyclone development . Gradual organization ensued as the low moved westward , and by July 26 , it had organized sufficiently to be classified as a tropical depression . The tropical depression failed to organize , however , and the center soon became difficult to locate on satellite imagery . After having lasted less than a day as a tropical cyclone , the depression opened up into a trough , as it became embedded within the Intertropical Convergence Zone at 12 : 00 UTC on July 27 .
