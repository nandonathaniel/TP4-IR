Augmentation , inoculative release and inundative release are different methods of biological control that affect the target pest in different ways . Augmentative control includes the periodic introduction of predators . With inundative release , predators are collected , mass - reared and periodically released in large numbers into the pest area . This is used for an immediate reduction in host populations , generally for annual crops , but is not suitable for long run use . With inoculative release a limited number of beneficial organisms are introduced at the start of the growing season . This strategy offers long term control as the organism 's progeny affect pest populations throughout the season and is common in orchards . With seasonal inoculative release the beneficials are collected , mass - reared and released seasonally to maintain the beneficial population . This is commonly used in greenhouses . In America and other western countries , inundative releases are predominant , while Asia and the eastern Europe more commonly use inoculation and occasional introductions .
