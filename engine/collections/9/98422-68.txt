With the death of Philip and most of their leaders , the Wampanoags were nearly exterminated ; only about 400 survived the war . The Narragansett and Nipmuck suffered similar rates of losses , and many small tribes in southern New England were , for all intents and purposes , finished . In addition , many Wampanoag were sold into slavery . Male captives were generally sold to slave traders and transported to the West Indies , Bermuda , Virginia , or the Iberian Peninsula . The colonists used the women and children as slaves in New England . Of those Indians not sold into slavery , the colony forced them to move into Natick , Wamesit , Punkapoag , and Hassanamesit , four of the original fourteen praying towns . These were the only ones to be resettled after the war . Overall , approximately five thousand Native Americans ( forty percent of their population ) and twenty - five hundred English colonists ( five percent ) were killed in King Philip 's War . By this time , the English population had increased so much that , while significant , the losses were less important for their overall society .
