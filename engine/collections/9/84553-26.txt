The albedos of planets , satellites and minor planets such as asteroids can be used to infer much about their properties . The study of albedos , their dependence on wavelength , lighting angle ( `` phase angle '' ) , and variation in time comprises a major part of the astronomical field of photometry . For small and far objects that can not be resolved by telescopes , much of what we know comes from the study of their albedos . For example , the absolute albedo can indicate the surface ice content of outer Solar System objects , the variation of albedo with phase angle gives information about regolith properties , whereas unusually high radar albedo is indicative of high metal content in asteroids .
