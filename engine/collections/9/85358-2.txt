But these laws have generally always been this way . During the height of the temperance movement in the late - 19th century and early - 20th century before nationwide prohibition , Missouri never implemented its own statewide prohibition . Actually , the voters of Missouri rejected prohibition in three separate initiative elections in 1910 , 1912 , and 1918 . When temperance crusader Carrie A. Nation entered a bar in Kansas City in April 1901 and began to smash liquor bottles with her hatchet , she was promptly arrested and fined $ 500 ( $12,926 in 2010 dollars ) , which her judge stayed as long as she agreed to leave Missouri and never return . The Missouri General Assembly did ratify the 18th Amendment in 1919 , but only after it already had received enough previous ratifications to become part of the Constitution .
