The three main islands of the Monach Islands ( Heisgeir ) , Ceann Iar , Ceann Ear and Shivinish are connected at low tides . It is said that at one time it was also possible to walk all the way to Baleshare , and on to North Uist , five miles away at low tide . In the 16th century , a large tidal wave was said to have washed the route away .
