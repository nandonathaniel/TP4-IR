Manchester United hold the record for the most victories , winning the competition 21 times since its inception . They also hold the distinction of having the most appearances ( 30 ) and most losses ( 9 ) . Although the Shield has had its share of historical moments -- from Eric Cantona 's first career hat - trick in 1992 , to Manchester United 's first loss of 1999 ending a streak of 33 consecutive games without a defeat -- it has been dismissed as a ceremonial friendly that is not on par with other domestic honours in terms of prestige . Winning the Shield has proven to be an unreliable indicator of success in the forthcoming season . Since the establishment of the Premier League in 1992 , only seven clubs that won the Shield proceeded to become League champions in the same season , the last being Manchester United in 2010 -- 11 . Indeed , Gianluca Vialli was sacked only weeks after guiding Chelsea to the victory in the 2000 match , following a lacklustre start to the season . The current holders are Arsenal , who defeated Chelsea in a penalty shootout after a 1 -- 1 draw in the 2017 edition .
