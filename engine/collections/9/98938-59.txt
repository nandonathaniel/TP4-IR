Antimatter - initialized fusion uses small amounts of antimatter to trigger a tiny fusion explosion . This has been studied primarily in the context of making nuclear pulse propulsion , and pure fusion bombs feasible . This is not near becoming a practical power source , due to the cost of manufacturing antimatter alone .
