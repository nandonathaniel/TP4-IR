The song was also parodied in an episode of Disney 's House of Mouse performed by Jiminy Cricket . The comedy group Three Dead Trolls in a Baggie also made a parody entitled `` The Sunscreen Marketing Board '' . Jegsy Dodd and the Original Sinners ' version , `` Grumpy Old Men '' , was voted favourite track of 2005 by BBC Radio 1 listeners in their annual Festive 50 poll .
