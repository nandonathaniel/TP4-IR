A syntactically similar expression `` Please do not shoot the pianist . He is doing his best '' . It originated around 1860 in the Wild West of the United States when Oscar Wilde , during his 1883 tour of the United States , saw this saying on a notice in a Leadville , Colorado , saloon . This phrase is sometimes attributed to Mark Twain , but neither Wilde nor Twain ever claimed authorship .
