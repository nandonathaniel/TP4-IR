According to some sources , the Chinese leader Mao Zedong played an important role in Khrushchev 's decision to suppress the Hungarian uprising . Chinese Communist Party Deputy Chairman Liu Shaoqi pressured Khrushchev to send in troops to put down the revolt by force . Although the relations between China and the Soviet Union had deteriorated during the recent years , Mao 's words still carried great weight in the Kremlin , and they were frequently in contact during the crisis . Initially , Mao opposed a second intervention , and this information was passed on to Khrushchev on 30 October , before the Presidium met and decided against intervention . Mao then changed his mind in favour of intervention but , according to William Taubman , it remains unclear when and how Khrushchev learned of this and thus if it influenced his decision on 31 October .
