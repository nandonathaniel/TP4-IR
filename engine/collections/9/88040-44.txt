It is widely accepted that the first cash machine was put into use by Barclays Bank in its Enfield Town branch in North London , United Kingdom , on 27 June 1967 . This machine was inaugurated by English comedy actor Reg Varney . This instance of the invention is credited to the engineering team led by John Shepherd - Barron of printing firm De La Rue , who was awarded an OBE in the 2005 New Year Honours . Transactions were initiated by inserting paper cheques issued by a teller or cashier , marked with carbon - 14 for machine readability and security , which in a later model were matched with a six - digit personal identification number ( PIN ) . Shepherd - Barron stated `` It struck me there must be a way I could get my own money , anywhere in the world or the UK . I hit upon the idea of a chocolate bar dispenser , but replacing chocolate with cash . ''
