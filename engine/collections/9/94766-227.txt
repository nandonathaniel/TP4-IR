On 16 December 1944 at 05 : 30 , the Germans began the assault with a massive , 90 - minute artillery barrage using 1,600 artillery pieces across a 130 - kilometre ( 80 mi ) front on the Allied troops facing the 6th Panzer Army . The Americans ' initial impression was that this was the anticipated , localized counterattack resulting from the Allies ' recent attack in the Wahlerscheid sector to the north , where the 2nd Division had knocked a sizable dent in the Siegfried Line . Heavy snowstorms engulfed parts of the Ardennes area . While having the effect of keeping the Allied aircraft grounded , the weather also proved troublesome for the Germans because poor road conditions hampered their advance . Poor traffic control led to massive traffic jams and fuel shortages in forward units .
