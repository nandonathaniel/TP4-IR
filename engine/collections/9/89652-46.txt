More recently two major new theories have been proposed . Professor Geoffrey Wainwright , president of the Society of Antiquaries of London , and Timothy Darvill , of Bournemouth University , have suggested that Stonehenge was a place of healing -- the primeval equivalent of Lourdes . They argue that this accounts for the high number of burials in the area and for the evidence of trauma deformity in some of the graves . However , they do concede that the site was probably multifunctional and used for ancestor worship as well . Isotope analysis indicates that some of the buried individuals were from other regions . A teenage boy buried approximately 1550 BC was raised near the Mediterranean Sea ; a metal worker from 2300 BC dubbed the `` Amesbury Archer '' grew up near the alpine foothills of Germany ; and the `` Boscombe Bowmen '' probably arrived from Wales or Brittany , France .
