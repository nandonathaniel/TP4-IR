In finance , the yield curve is a curve showing several yields or interest rates across different contract lengths ( 2 month , 2 year , 20 year , etc ... ) for a similar debt contract . The curve shows the relation between the ( level of the ) interest rate ( or cost of borrowing ) and the time to maturity , known as the `` term '' , of the debt for a given borrower in a given currency . For example , the U.S. dollar interest rates paid on U.S. Treasury securities for various maturities are closely watched by many traders , and are commonly plotted on a graph such as the one on the right which is informally called `` the yield curve '' . More formal mathematical descriptions of this relation are often called the term structure of interest rates .
