Airplane ! ( alternatively titled Flying High ! ) is a 1980 American satirical disaster film written and directed by David and Jerry Zucker and Jim Abrahams , and produced by Jon Davison . It stars Robert Hays and Julie Hagerty and features Leslie Nielsen , Robert Stack , Lloyd Bridges , Peter Graves , Kareem Abdul - Jabbar , and Lorna Patterson . The film is a parody of the disaster film genre , particularly the 1957 Paramount film Zero Hour ! , from which it borrows the plot and the central characters , as well as many elements from Airport 1975 . The film is known for its use of surreal humor and its fast - paced slapstick comedy , including visual and verbal puns , gags and obscure humor like propeller sound effects for a jet plane .
