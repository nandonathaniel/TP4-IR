Context and many other aspects can affect apparent dissonance and consonance . For example , in a Debussy prelude , a major second may sound stable and consonant , while the same interval may sound dissonant in a Bach fugue . In the Common Practice era , the perfect fourth is considered dissonant when not supported by a lower third or fifth . Since the early 20th century , Arnold Schoenberg 's concept of `` emancipated '' dissonance , in which traditionally dissonant intervals can be treated as `` higher , '' more remote consonances , has become more widely accepted .
