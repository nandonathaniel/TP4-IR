The Fujiwara rulers failed to maintain adequate police forces , which left robbers free to prey on travelers . This is implicitly illustrated in novels by the terror that night travel inspired in the main characters . The shōen system enabled the accumulation of wealth by an aristocratic elite ; the economic surplus can be linked to the cultural developments of the Heian period and the `` pursuit of arts '' . The major Buddhist temples in Heian - kyō and Nara also made use of the shōen . The establishment of branches rurally and integration of some Shinto shrines within these temple networks reflects a greater `` organizational dynamism '' .
