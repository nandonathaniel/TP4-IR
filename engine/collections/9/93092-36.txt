The building of the Tower was meant to bid defiance not only to God , but also to Abraham , who exhorted the builders to reverence . The passage mentions that the builders spoke sharp words against God , saying that once every 1,656 years , heaven tottered so that the water poured down upon the earth , therefore they would support it by columns that there might not be another deluge ( Gen. R. l.c. ; Tan . l.c. ; similarly Josephus , `` Ant . '' i . 4 , ยง 2 ) .
