Strategizing also plays a role . Numerous record labels have taken deliberate steps to maximize their chart positions by such tactics as timing a single 's debut to face the weakest possible competition , or massively discounting the price of singles to the point where each individual sale represented a financial loss . Meanwhile , other labels would deliberately withhold even their most marketable songs in order to boost album sales . Particularly in the 1990s , many of the most heavily played MTV and radio hits were unavailable for separate purchase . Because of such countervailing strategies , it can not be said that a Hot 100 chart necessarily lists the country 's 100 most popular or successful songs . Strategies like these were the main reason behind the December 1998 change in the charts .
