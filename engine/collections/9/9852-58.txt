Formed in New York City in 1985 to protest against what it saw as the New York Post 's defamatory and sensationalized AIDS coverage , GLAAD put pressure on media organizations to end what it saw as homophobic reporting . Initial meetings were held in the homes of several New York City activists as well as after - hours at the New York State Council on the Arts . The founding group included film scholar Vito Russo ; Gregory Kolovakos , then on the staff of the NYS Arts Council and who later became the first executive director ; Darryl Yates Rist ; Allen Barnett ; and Jewelle Gomez , the organization 's first treasurer . Some members of GLAAD went on to become the early members of ACT UP .
