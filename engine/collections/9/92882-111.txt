Substitution mutations , often caused by chemicals or malfunction of DNA replication , exchange a single nucleotide for another . These changes are classified as transitions or transversions . Most common is the transition that exchanges a purine for a purine ( A ↔ G ) or a pyrimidine for a pyrimidine , ( C ↔ T ) . A transition can be caused by nitrous acid , base mis - pairing , or mutagenic base analogs such as BrdU . Less common is a transversion , which exchanges a purine for a pyrimidine or a pyrimidine for a purine ( C / T ↔ A / G ) . An example of a transversion is the conversion of adenine ( A ) into a cytosine ( C ) . A point mutation are modifications of single base pairs of DNA or other small base pairs within a gene . A point mutation can be reversed by another point mutation , in which the nucleotide is changed back to its original state ( true reversion ) or by second - site reversion ( a complementary mutation elsewhere that results in regained gene functionality ) . As discussed below , point mutations that occur within the protein coding region of a gene may be classified as synonymous or nonsynonymous substitutions , the latter of which in turn can be divided into missense or nonsense mutations .
