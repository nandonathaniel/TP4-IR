In July 2011 , MPPEB monitored 145 suspects during the Pre-Medical Test ( PMT ) . Most of the suspects did not turn up , but 8 were caught for impersonating others . This included Kanpur - based Satyendra Varma , who had accepted â‚¹ 4 lakh to appear in place of Ashish Yadav , in Indore. 15 exam toppers from the previous year appeared for the exam . Suspecting that these people were called in to impersonate others or to help candidates cheat by sitting adjacent to them , MPPEB asked them to explain their reasons for re-taking the exams . MPPEB also started using biometric technology : thumb impressions and photographs of all the persons appearing for the exam were taken to be matched during the post-results counselling .
