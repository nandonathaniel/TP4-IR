In the 1870 and 80s , so many Jewish émigrés were arriving that over 150 synagogues were built . Today there are only four active synagogues remaining in Tower Hamlets : the Congregation of Jacob Synagogue ( 1903 -- Kehillas Ya'akov ) , the East London Central Synagogue ( 1922 ) , the Fieldgate Street Great Synagogue ( 1899 ) and Sandys Row Synagogue ( 1766 ) . Jewish immigration to the East End peaked in the 1890s , leading to anti-foreigner agitation by the British Brothers League , formed in 1902 by Captain William Stanley Shaw and the Conservative MP for Stepney , Major Evans - Gordon , who had overturned a Liberal majority in the 1900 General Election on a platform of limiting immigration . In Parliament in 1902 , Evans - Gordon claimed that `` not a day passes but English families are ruthlessly turned out to make room for foreign invaders . The rates are burdened with the education of thousands of foreign children . '' Jewish immigration only slowed with the passing of the Aliens Act 1905 , which gave the Home Secretary powers to regulate and control immigration .
