Von Braun 's attitude toward the National Socialist regime in the late 1930s and early 1940s is difficult to understand . By his own account , he had been so influenced by the early Nazi promise of release from the post -- World War I economic effects , that his patriotic feelings had increased . In a 1952 memoir article he admitted that , at that time , he `` fared relatively rather well under totalitarianism '' . Yet , he also wrote that `` to us , Hitler was still only a pompous fool with a Charlie Chaplin moustache '' and that he perceived him as `` another Napoleon '' who was `` wholly without scruples , a godless man who thought himself the only god '' .
