The documentary film also rose as a commercial genre for perhaps the first time , with the success of films such as March of the Penguins and Michael Moore 's Bowling for Columbine and Fahrenheit 9 / 11 . A new genre was created with Martin Kunert and Eric Manes ' Voices of Iraq , when 150 inexpensive DV cameras were distributed across Iraq , transforming ordinary people into collaborative filmmakers . The success of Gladiator led to a revival of interest in epic cinema , and Moulin Rouge ! renewed interest in musical cinema . Home theatre systems became increasingly sophisticated , as did some of the special edition DVDs designed to be shown on them . The Lord of the Rings trilogy was released on DVD in both the theatrical version and in a special extended version intended only for home cinema audiences .
