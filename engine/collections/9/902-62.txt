Writers stress continuity of Japanese cultural and aesthetic traditions as central to the history of manga . They include Frederik L. Schodt , Kinko Ito , Adam L. Kern , and Eric Peter Nash . Schodt points to the existence in the 13th century of illustrated picture scrolls like Chōjū - jinbutsu - giga that told stories in sequential images with humor and wit . Schodt also stresses continuities of aesthetic style and vision between ukiyo - e and shunga woodblock prints and modern manga ( all three fulfill Eisner 's criteria for sequential art ) . While there are disputes over whether Chōjū - jinbutsu - giga or Shigisan - engi was the first manga , both scrolls date back to about the same time period . However others like Isao Takahata , Studio Ghibli co-founder and director , contends there is no linkage with the scrolls and modern manga .
