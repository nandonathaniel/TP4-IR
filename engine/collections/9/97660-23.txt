`` Ca n't Take My Eyes Off You '' has had hundreds of cover versions , many of which have been on the charts in different countries . The song is a staple of television and film soundtracks , even being featured as part of the plot of some films , such as when the lead characters sing or arrange their own version of the song . Its chorus has also become a popular football chant , with supporters of various teams inserting their club 's name or a popular player 's name into the beat ( for instance , A.S. Roma fans sing `` Francesco Totti , la la , la la la la ! '' ) . The Valli version was also used by NASA as a wake - up song for a mission of the Space Shuttle , on the anniversary of astronaut Christopher Ferguson .
