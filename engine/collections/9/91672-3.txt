The Hippocratic Corpus , popularly attributed to an ancient Greek practitioner known as Hippocrates , lays out the basic approach to health care . Greek philosophers viewed the human body as a system that reflects the workings of nature and Hippocrates applied this belief to medicine . The body , as a reflection of natural forces , contained four elemental properties expressed to the Greeks as the four humors . The humors represented fire , air , earth and water through the properties of hot , cold , dry and moist , respectively . Health in the human body relied on keeping these humors in balance within each person .
