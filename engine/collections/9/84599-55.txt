Dōngyáng ( 東洋 ) and Dōngyíng ( 東瀛 ) -- both literally , `` Eastern Ocean '' -- are Chinese terms sometimes used to refer to Japan exotically when contrasting it with other countries or regions in eastern Eurasia ; however , these same terms may also be used to refer to all of East Asia when contrasting `` the East '' with `` the West '' . The first term , Dōngyáng , has been considered to be a pejorative term when used to mean `` Japan '' , while the second , Dōngyíng , has remained a positive poetic name . They can be contrasted with Nányáng ( Southern Ocean ) , which refers to Southeast Asia , and Xīyáng ( Western Ocean ) , which refers to the Western world . In Japanese and Korean , the Chinese word for `` Eastern Ocean '' ( pronounced as tōyō in Japanese and as dongyang ( 동양 ) in Korean ) is used only to refer to the Far East ( including both East Asia and Southeast Asia ) in general , and it is not used in the more specific Chinese sense of `` Japan '' .
