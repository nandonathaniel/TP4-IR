The last moderate proposal was the Fourteenth Amendment , whose principal drafter was Representative John Bingham . It was designed to put the key provisions of the Civil Rights Act into the Constitution , but it went much further . It extended citizenship to everyone born in the United States ( except visitors and Indians on reservations ) , penalized states that did not give the vote to freedmen , and most importantly , created new federal civil rights that could be protected by federal courts . It guaranteed the Federal war debt would be paid ( and promised the Confederate debt would never be paid ) . Johnson used his influence to block the amendment in the states since three - fourths of the states were required for ratification ( the amendment was later ratified . ) . The moderate effort to compromise with Johnson had failed , and a political fight broke out between the Republicans ( both Radical and moderate ) on one side , and on the other side , Johnson and his allies in the Democratic Party in the North , and the conservative groupings ( which used different names ) in each southern state .
