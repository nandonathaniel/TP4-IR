Under the command of Bolívar and Sucre , the experienced veterans of the combined army , mainly Colombians , destroyed a royalist army under La Serna 's command in the Battle of Ayacucho on December 9 , 1824 . La Serna 's army was numerically superior but consisted of mostly new recruits . The only significant royalist area remaining on the continent was the highland country of Upper Peru . Following the Battle of Ayacucho , the royalist troops of Upper Peru under the command of Olañeta surrendered after he died in Tumusla on April 2 , 1825 . Bolívar tended to favor maintaining the unity of Upper Peru with Peru , but the Upper Peruvian leaders -- many former royalists , like Casimiro Olañeta , nephew of General Olañeta -- gathered in a congress under Sucre 's auspices supported the country 's independence . Bolívar left the decision to Sucre , who went along with the congress . Sucre proclaimed Upper Peru 's independence in the city which now bears his name on August 6 , bringing the main wars of independence to an end .
