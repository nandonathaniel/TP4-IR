The first two Union divisions arrived on the afternoon of September 15 and the bulk of the remainder of the army late that evening . Although an immediate Union attack on the morning of September 16 would have had an overwhelming advantage in numbers , McClellan 's trademark caution and his belief that Lee had as many as 100,000 men at Sharpsburg caused him to delay his attack for a day . This gave the Confederates more time to prepare defensive positions and allowed Longstreet 's corps to arrive from Hagerstown and Jackson 's corps , minus A.P. Hill 's division , to arrive from Harpers Ferry . Jackson defended the left ( northern ) flank , anchored on the Potomac , Longstreet the right ( southern ) flank , anchored on the Antietam , a line that was about 4 miles ( 6 km ) long . ( As the battle progressed and Lee shifted units , these corps boundaries overlapped considerably . )
