Coming immediately after the destruction of the parliament buildings by fire in 1916 , the Peace Tower 's conception coincided with the end of the First World War . With this in mind , Prime Minister Robert Borden dedicated the site of the tower on 1 July 1917 , with the words : `` ( the tower will be a ) memorial to the debt of our forefathers and to the valour of those Canadians who , in the Great War , fought for the liberties of Canada , of the Empire , and of humanity . '' Two years later , the Peace Tower 's foundation stone was laid by Prince Edward , Prince of Wales ( later King Edward VIII ) , during his wider royal tour of Canada , and the structure was topped out in 1922 .
