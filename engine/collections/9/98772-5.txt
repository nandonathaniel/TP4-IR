The floodplain is the natural place for a river to dissipate its energy . Meanders form over the floodplain to slow down the flow of water and when the channel is at capacity the water spills over the floodplain where it is temporarily stored . In terms of flood management the upper part of the floodplain ( piedmont zone ) is crucial as this is where the flood water control starts . Artificial canalisation of the river here will have a major impact on wider flooding . This is the basis of sustainable flood management .
