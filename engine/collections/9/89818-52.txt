In addition to barriers to entry and competition , barriers to exit may be a source of market power . Barriers to exit are market conditions that make it difficult or expensive for a company to end its involvement with a market . High liquidation costs are a primary barrier to exiting . Market exit and shutdown are sometimes separate events . The decision whether to shut down or operate is not affected by exit barriers . A company will shut down if price falls below minimum average variable costs .
