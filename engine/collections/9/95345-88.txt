In Pigford v. Glickman , U.S. Federal District Court Judge Paul L. Friedman approved the settlement and consent decree on April 14 , 1999 . The settlement recognized discrimination against 22,363 black farmers but the NBFA would later call the agreement incomplete because more than 70,000 were excluded . Nevertheless , the settlement was deemed to be the largest - ever civil rights class action settlement in American history . Lawyers estimated the value of the settlement to be more than $2 billion . Some farmers would have their debts forgiven . Judge Friedman appointed a monitor to oversee the settlement . Farmers in Alabama , Mississippi , Arkansas , and Georgia were among those affected by the settlement .
