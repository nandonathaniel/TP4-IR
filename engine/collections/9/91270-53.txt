The majority of mainstream liturgical churches require that sacramental wine should be pure grape wine . In the Eastern Orthodox Church , for example , sacramental wine used in the Divine Liturgy must usually be fermented pure red grape wine , often sweet , though this is not required . Greek churches favour the use of Mavrodaphne or Nama , while Russian churches favour Kagor . Wines with additives , such as retsina , are not allowed .
