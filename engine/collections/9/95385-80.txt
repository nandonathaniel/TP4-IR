Ceremonies were carried out before kamikaze pilots departed on their final mission . The Kamikaze shared ceremonial cups of sake or water known as `` mizu no sakazuki '' . Many Army officer Kamikaze took their swords with them , while the Navy pilots ( as a general rule ) did not carry swords in their planes . The kamikaze , like all Japanese aviators flying over unfriendly territory , were issued ( or purchased , if they were officers ) a Nambu pistol with which to end their lives if they risked being captured . Like all Army and Navy servicemen , the Kamikaze would wear their senninbari , a `` belt of a thousand stitches '' given to them by their mothers . They also composed and read a death poem , a tradition stemming from the samurai , who did it before committing seppuku . Pilots carried prayers from their families and were given military decorations . The Kamikaze were escorted by other pilots whose function was to protect the Kamikaze to their destination and report on the results . Some of these escort pilots , such as Zero pilot Toshimitsu Imaizumi , were themselves later sent out on their own Kamikaze missions .
