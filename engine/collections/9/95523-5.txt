Photosynthetic organisms appeared between 3.2 and 2.4 billion years ago and began enriching the atmosphere with oxygen . Life remained mostly small and microscopic until about 580 million years ago , when complex multicellular life arose , developed over time , and culminated in the Cambrian Explosion about 541 million years ago . This event drove a rapid diversification of life forms on Earth that produced most of the major phyla known today , and it marked the end of the Proterozoic Eon and the beginning of the Cambrian Period of the Paleozoic Era . More than 99 percent of all species , amounting to over five billion species , that ever lived on Earth are estimated to be extinct . Estimates on the number of Earth 's current species range from 10 million to 14 million , of which about 1.2 million are documented , but over 86 percent have not been described . Scientists recently reported that 1 trillion species are estimated to be on Earth currently with only one - thousandth of one percent described .
