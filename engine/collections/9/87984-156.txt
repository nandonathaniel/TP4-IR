Chemical burns from skin exposures can be decontaminated by washing with polyethylene glycol , isopropyl alcohol , or perhaps even copious amounts of water . Removal of contaminated clothing is required , as well as immediate hospital treatment for large splashes . This is particularly important if the phenol is mixed with chloroform ( a commonly used mixture in molecular biology for DNA and RNA purification ) . Phenol is also a reproductive toxin causing increased risk of abortion and low birth weight indicating retarded development in utero .
