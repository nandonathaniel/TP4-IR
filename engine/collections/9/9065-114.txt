Hurricane Irma affected multiple states in the South , especially Florida . Except the Florida Keys , the total damage Irma caused was not as great as government officials and forecasters had warned . Hurricane Irma weakened after making landfall in Cuba , but strengthened back into a Category 4 prior to hitting the Keys . The Florida Keys suffered the worst of the damage in the United States . After surveying the aftermath of Irma , Florida governor Rick Scott said `` I thought we would see more damage '' ( on the mainland ) but said `` he witnessed devastation in the Keys '' . President Donald Trump commented on Twitter that the devastation in some places was `` far greater than anyone thought '' .
