There is evidence that Emanuel Swedenborg first proposed parts of the nebular hypothesis in 1734 . Immanuel Kant , familiar with Swedenborg 's work , developed the theory further in 1755 , publishing his own Universal Natural History and Theory of the Heavens , wherein he argued that gaseous clouds ( nebulae ) slowly rotate , gradually collapse and flatten due to gravity , eventually forming stars and planets .
