Occasionally , scourging preceded crucifixion , which would cause the condemned to lose a large amount of blood , and approach a state of shock . The convict then usually had to carry the horizontal beam ( patibulum in Latin ) to the place of execution , but not necessarily the whole cross . Crucifixion was typically carried out by specialized teams , consisting of a commanding centurion and four soldiers . When it was done in an established place of execution , the vertical beam ( stipes ) could even be permanently embedded in the ground . It 's claimed by certain religious texts that the victims of crucifixion were stripped naked before being put on the cross -- all the New Testament gospels describe soldiers gambling for the robes of Jesus .
