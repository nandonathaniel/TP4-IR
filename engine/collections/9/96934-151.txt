In response to the repression , the St. Augustine movement practiced armed self - defense in addition to nonviolent direct action . In June 1963 , Dr. Hayling publicly stated that `` I and the others have armed . We will shoot first and answer questions later . We are not going to die like Medgar Evers . '' The comment made national headlines . When Klan nightriders terrorized black neighborhoods in St. Augustine , Hayling 's NAACP members often drove them off with gunfire , and in October , a Klansman was killed .
