Lahr also portrayed the Lion 's Kansas counterpart , Zeke ( one of Aunt Em and Uncle Henry 's farmworkers ) . Screenwriter Noel Langley created this character for the film . Zeke helps Hickory ( Tin Man 's alter ego ) lower a bed into its place on a wagon at the farm . He then moves the hogs into the pig pen and pours feed into their trough and later rescues Dorothy when she falls off the railing that encircles the pen . He wears his hat throughout the entire film because he does not struggle to open the cellar when the tornado approaches the farm . Hunk ( Scarecrow 's alter ego ) closes and locks the cellar with him when Dorothy arrives at the farmhouse . Zeke and Professor Marvel ( The Wizard 's alter ego ) are the only men wearing hats when Dorothy awakens from being unconscious .
