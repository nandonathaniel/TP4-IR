In 1865 English amateur astronomer William Huggins used his visual spectroscopy method to examine the nebula showing it , like other nebulae he had examined , was made up of `` luminous gas '' . On September 30 , 1880 Henry Draper used the new dry plate photographic process with an 11 - inch ( 28 cm ) refracting telescope to make a 51 - minute exposure of the Orion Nebula , the first instance of astrophotography of a nebula in history . Another set of photographs of the nebula in 1883 saw breakthrough in astronomical photography when amateur astronomer Andrew Ainslie Common used the dry plate process to record several images in exposures up to 60 minutes with a 36 - inch ( 91 cm ) reflecting telescope that he constructed in the backyard of his home in Ealing , outside London . These images for the first time showed stars and nebula detail too faint to be seen by the human eye .
