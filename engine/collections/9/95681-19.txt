A longitudinal study in New Zealand involving 1000 people ( from childhood to 26 years of age ) demonstrated that `` television viewing in childhood and adolescence is associated with poor educational achievement by 12 years of age '' . The same paper noted that there was a significant negative association between time spent watching television per day as a child and educational attainment by age 26 : the more time a child spent watching television at ages 5 to 15 , the less likely they were to have a university degree by age 26 . However , recent research ( Schmidt et al. , 2009 ) has indicated that , once other factors are controlled for , television viewing appears to have little to no impact on cognitive performance , contrary to previous thought . However , this study was limited to cognitive performance in childhood . Numerous studies have also examined the relationship between TV viewing and school grades .
