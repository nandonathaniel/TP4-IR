Megasthenes 's book Indica derives its name from the river 's Greek name , `` Indós '' ( Ἰνδός ) , and describes Nearchus 's contemporaneous account of how Alexander the Great crossed the river . The ancient Greeks referred to the Indians ( people of present - day northwest India and Pakistan ) as `` Indói '' ( Ἰνδοί ) , literally meaning `` the people of the Indus '' .
