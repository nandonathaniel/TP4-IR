Pantsov and Levine see many of the post-Mao Tse - Tung economic reforms of CCP leader Deng Xiaoping in the People 's Republic of China during the 1980s as influenced by the NEP . `` It will be recalled that Deng Xiaoping himself had studied Marxism from the works of the Bolshevik leaders who had propounded NEP . It is obvious that he drew on ideas from NEP when he spoke of his own reforms . In 1985 , he openly acknowledged that ' perhaps ' the most correct model of socialism was the New Economic Policy of the USSR . ''
