The flag should normally be displayed on a flagstaff , with the green pale positioned next to the flagstaff , at the hoist ; the white pale positioned in the centre ; and the orange pale positioned at the fly , farthest from the flagstaff . Provided that the correct proportions are observed , the flag may be made to any convenient size .
