Questions regarding the multiplayer aspects of No Man 's Sky were raised a day following the official release on the PlayStation 4 . Two players attempted to meet up at the same location in the game 's virtual universe after one player recognised the other by their username associated with a planetary discovery . Despite confirming they had been at the same spot on the same planet outside of the game through their respective Twitch.tv streams , they could not see each other . Furthering this was the discovery that European copies of the limited edition packaging used a sticker to cover the PEGI online play icon . Journalists noted a number of potential reasons why the players may not have encountered each other , including the users being on separate instances or server problems reported by Hello Games at launch , though some opined that this may have been a feature removed before launch . Hello Games noted that they have had `` far more '' players than they expected at launch and are bringing on more people to help support the game along with patching the critical issues at the game 's launch , but they have not made a direct statement on the multiplayer situation as of September 2016 .
