Overcrowding soon became a big concern , as well as poor sanitation . The jails turned into breeding houses of illness . Furthermore , the jails were even unable to fulfill their basic purpose of containing offenders within its walls . Escapes were very frequent .

They were expected to learn good work ethic during their stay .
