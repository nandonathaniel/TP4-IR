Moreover , a parallel algorithm can be implemented either in a parallel system ( using shared memory ) or in a distributed system ( using message passing ) . The traditional boundary between parallel and distributed algorithms ( choose a suitable network vs. run in any given network ) does not lie in the same place as the boundary between parallel and distributed systems ( shared memory vs. message passing ) .
