West Germany ( and West Berlin ) were centers of East - West conflict during the Cold War and numerous communist fronts were established . For example , the Society for German -- Soviet Friendship ( GfDSF ) had 13,000 members in West Germany , but it was banned in 1953 by some LÃ¤nder as a communist front . The Democratic Cultural League of Germany started off as a series of genuinely pluralistic bodies , but in 1950 -- 1951 came under the control of communists . By 1952 , the U.S. Embassy counted 54 `` infiltrated organizations '' , which started independently , as well as 155 `` front organizations '' , which had been Communist inspired from their start .
