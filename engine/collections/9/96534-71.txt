A toddler version of Foghorn made appearances in short music videos of Baby Looney Tunes . He starred in only one episode of the show , in which he was trying to fit in with a gang of cool roosters and employed the help of Tweety and his friends before Lola Bunny suggested to just be himself , which came in handy when Barnyard Dog chased the cool roosters .
