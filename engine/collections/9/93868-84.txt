The claim that the National Guard is older than the nation itself , with over three and a half centuries of service , is based on the claim that the modern - day 101st Field Artillery Regiment , 182nd Infantry Regiment , 101st Engineer Battalion and 181st Infantry Regiment of the Massachusetts Army National Guard are directly descended from Massachusetts Bay Colony regiments formed over 375 years ago . On December 13 , 1636 , the General Court of the Massachusetts Bay Colony had ordered that the Colony 's scattered militia companies be organized into North , South and East Regiments -- with a goal of increasing the militias ' accountability to the colonial government , efficacy , and responsiveness in conflicts with indigenous Pequot Indians . Under this act , white males between the ages of 16 and 60 were obligated to possess arms and to take part in the defense of their communities by serving in nightly guard details and participating in weekly drills . The founding date of 1636 refers to service of the colonial government ; the Massachusetts Bay Colony regiments were formed by reorganizing local militias that preceded the 1636 date and dated back to the founding dates of the various Massachusetts towns of the time .
