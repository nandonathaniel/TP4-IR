The 2008 Chandrayaan - 1 spacecraft has since confirmed the existence of surface water ice , using the on - board Moon Mineralogy Mapper . The spectrometer observed absorption lines common to hydroxyl , in reflected sunlight , providing evidence of large quantities of water ice , on the lunar surface . The spacecraft showed that concentrations may possibly be as high as 1,000 ppm . In 2009 , LCROSS sent a 2,300 kg ( 5,100 lb ) impactor into a permanently shadowed polar crater , and detected at least 100 kg ( 220 lb ) of water in a plume of ejected material . Another examination of the LCROSS data showed the amount of detected water to be closer to 155 ± 12 kg ( 342 ± 26 lb ) .
