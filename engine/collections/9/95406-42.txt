In 1953 , North Carolina split from the Southern Conference and became a founding member of the Atlantic Coast Conference . The Tar Heels won their first NCAA Championship in 1957 under fifth year head coach Frank McGuire , who led an undefeated 32 - 0 squad dominated by Lennie Rosenbluth and several other transplants from the New York City area to a 54 - 53 triple overtime victory over Wilt Chamberlain 's Kansas Jayhawks . C.D. Chesley , a Washington , D.C. television producer , piped the 1957 championship game in Kansas City to a hastily created network of five stations across North Carolina -- the ancestor to the current syndicated ACC football and basketball package from Raycom Sports -- which helped prove pivotal in basketball becoming a craze in the state . The title game was the only triple overtime final game in championship history , which followed a triple overtime North Carolina defeat of Michigan State 74 - 70 the previous night .
