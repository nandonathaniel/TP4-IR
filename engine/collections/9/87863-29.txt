Although unintentional , the song 's composition was pivotal in the film 's characterization of Elsa . Although Elsa was originally written as a villain , co-directors Chris Buck and Lee gradually rewrote Elsa into one of the film 's protagonists after `` Let It Go '' was composed . About that , Lee later explained , `` the minute we heard the song the first time , I knew that I had to rewrite the whole movie . '' Buck further clarified : `` Jen had to go back and rewrite some pages in the first act to build up to that scene ... You have to set it up well enough in advance so that when the song comes , the audience is ready for it and there 's an emotional payoff . ''
