According to the Odyssey , Menelaus 's fleet was blown by storms to Crete and Egypt , where they were unable to sail away due to calm winds . Only five of his ships survived . Menelaus had to catch Proteus , a shape - shifting sea god , to find out what sacrifices to which gods he would have to make to guarantee safe passage . According to some stories the Helen who was taken by Paris was a fake , and the real Helen was in Egypt , where she was reunited with Menelaus . Proteus also told Menelaus that he was destined for Elysium ( Heaven ) after his death . Menelaus returned to Sparta with Helen eight years after he had left Troy .
