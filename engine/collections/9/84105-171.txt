The two party system matured in the early 19th century era of political reform , when the franchise was widened and politics entered into the basic divide between conservatism and liberalism that has fundamentally endured up to the present . The modern Conservative Party was created out of the `` Pittite '' Tories by Robert Peel , who issued the Tamworth Manifesto in 1834 which set out the basic principles of Conservatism ; - the necessity in specific cases of reform in order to survive , but an opposition to unnecessary change , that could lead to `` a perpetual vortex of agitation '' . Meanwhile , the Whigs , along with free trade Tory followers of Robert Peel , and independent Radicals , formed the Liberal Party under Lord Palmerston in 1859 , and transformed into a party of the growing urban middle - class , under the long leadership of William Ewart Gladstone . The two party system had come of age at the time of Gladstone and his Conservative rival Benjamin Disraeli after the 1867 Reform Act .
