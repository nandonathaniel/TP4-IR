In federal elections since 2006 , both parties have seen successes . Republican Senator George Allen lost close races in 2006 , to Democratic newcomer Jim Webb , and again in 2012 , to Webb 's replacement , former Governor Tim Kaine . In 2008 , Democrats won both United States Senate seats ; former Governor Mark Warner was elected to replace retiring Republican John Warner . The state went Republican in 13 out of 14 presidential elections from 1952 to 2004 , including 10 in a row from 1968 to 2004 . However , Democrat Barack Obama carried Virginia 's 13 electoral votes in both the 2008 and 2012 presidential elections . In the 2010 elections , Republicans won three United States House of Representatives seats from the Democrats . Of the state 's eleven seats in the House of Representatives , Republicans hold seven and Democrats hold four . Virginia is considered a `` swing state '' in future presidential elections .
