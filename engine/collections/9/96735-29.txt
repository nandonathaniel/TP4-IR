Given the varied and even contradictory interpretations of the colour green , its precise meaning in the poem remains ambiguous . In English folklore and literature , green was traditionally used to symbolise nature and its associated attributes : fertility and rebirth . Stories of the medieval period also used it to allude to love and the base desires of man . Because of its connection with faeries and spirits in early English folklore , green also signified witchcraft , devilry and evil . It can also represent decay and toxicity . When combined with gold , as with the Green Knight and the girdle , green was often seen as representing youth 's passing . In Celtic mythology , green was associated with misfortune and death , and therefore avoided in clothing . The green girdle , originally worn for protection , became a symbol of shame and cowardice ; it is finally adopted as a symbol of honour by the knights of Camelot , signifying a transformation from good to evil and back again ; this displays both the spoiling and regenerative connotations of the colour green .
