In 1575 an Italian printmaker , Francesco Rampazetto , invented the scrittura tattile , a machine to impress letters in papers . In 1714 , Henry Mill obtained a patent in Britain for a machine that , from the patent , appears to have been similar to a typewriter . The patent shows that this machine was actually created : `` ( he ) hath by his great study and paines & expence invented and brought to perfection an artificial machine or method for impressing or transcribing of letters , one after another , as in writing , whereby all writing whatsoever may be engrossed in paper or parchment so neat and exact as not to be distinguished from print ; that the said machine or method may be of great use in settlements and public records , the impression being deeper and more lasting than any other writing , and not to be erased or counterfeited without manifest discovery . '' In 1802 Italian Agostino Fantoni developed a particular typewriter to enable his blind sister to write . In 1808 Italian Pellegrino Turri invented a typewriter . He also invented carbon paper to provide the ink for his machine . In 1823 Italian Pietro Conti di Cilavegna invented a new model of typewriter , the tachigrafo , also known as tachitipo .
