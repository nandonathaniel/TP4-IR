The original park , Six Flags Over Texas in Arlington ( between Dallas and Fort Worth ) was sold in 1966 to a subsidiary of the Pennsylvania Railroad , which was actively pursuing non-railroad investments in an effort to diversify its sources of income . ( In 1968 , the Pennsylvania Railroad merged with the New York Central Railroad to form Penn Central Corp . ) With the new owners came a more abundant supply of capital for geographic expansion and park additions . Six Flags opened Six Flags Over Georgia in 1967 and Six Flags Over Mid-America in 1971 , which would , along with Six Flags Over Texas , be the only three parks that would be constructed by the company .
