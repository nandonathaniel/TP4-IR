The number of fast days varies from year to year , but in general the Eastern Orthodox Christian can expect to spend a little over half the year fasting at some level of strictness . There are spiritual , symbolic , and even practical reasons for fasting . In the Fall from Paradise mankind became possessed by a carnal nature ; that is to say , became inclined towards the passions . Through fasting , Orthodox Christians attempt to return to the relationship of love and obedience to God enjoyed by Adam and Eve in Paradise in their own lives , by refraining from carnal practices , by bridling the tongue ( James 3 : 5 -- 6 ) , confession of sins , prayer and almsgiving .
