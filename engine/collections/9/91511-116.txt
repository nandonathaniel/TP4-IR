Elise Jost of Moviepilot observed that `` Gadot 's take on Wonder Woman is one of those unique cases of an actor merging with their story , similar to Robert Downey Jr. 's Tony Stark . Gal Gadot is Wonder Woman , and Wonder Woman is Gal Gadot . '' Jost praised Gadot 's interpretation of Wonder Woman as the one in which Gadot `` absolutely nails the character 's unwaveringly positive outlook on life . She 's a force of nature who believes in the greater good ; her conviction that she 's meant to save the world is stronger than her bullet - deflecting shield . She 's genuine , she 's fun , she 's the warm source of energy at the heart of the movie . '' The Federalist suggests that Wonder Woman is `` a story of Jesus '' . `` The movie is wrapped up in faux Greek mythology , true , but there 's no mistaking the Christology here . '' `` Perhaps Christ in the form of a beautiful and kick - ass Amazon is all that our contemporary society can handle right now '' , stated M. Hudson , a Christian feminist . On HuffPost cultural critic , G. Roger Denson , who regards the superhero genre as a source of contemporary `` Mainstream Mythopoetics '' ( `` the making of new yet vitally meaningful , if not symbolic , stories filled with imagery reflecting , yet also shaping and advancing , the political , legal , moral and social practices of today '' ) , wrote that the `` No Man 's Land '' scene `` that people are crying over in theaters and raving about afterward happens to be among the most powerfully mythopoetic scenes ever filmed at the same time it is one of the oldest myths to have been utilized by artists and writers after it had been invented by early military strategists and leaders . '' Specifically `` used by director Patty Jenkins '' , the scene raises `` the esteem for powerful yet compassionate women as heroes and leaders to a level equal with that of men for having won over a huge and adoring popular audience around the world '' .
