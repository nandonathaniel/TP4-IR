Until recent decades , the transition to farming was seen as an inherently progressive one : people learnt that planting seeds caused crops to grow , and this new improved food source led to larger populations , sedentary farm and town life , more leisure time and so to specialization , writing , technological advances and civilization . It is now clear that agriculture was adopted despite certain disadvantages of that lifestyle . Archeological studies show that health deteriorated in populations that adopted cereal agriculture , returning to pre-agricultural levels only in modern times . This is in part attributable to the spread of infection in crowded cities , but is largely due to a decline in dietary quality that accompanied intensive cereal farming . People in many parts of the world remained hunter - gatherers until quite recently ; though they were quite aware of the existence and methods of agriculture , they declined to undertake it . Many explanations have been offered , usually centered around a particular factor that forced the adoption of agriculture , such as environmental or population pressure .
