The first All - Star Game was held as part of the 1933 World 's Fair at Comiskey Park and was the brainchild of Arch Ward , then sports editor for the Chicago Tribune . Initially intended to be a one - time event , its great success resulted in making the game an annual event , with some years ( 1959 - 1962 ) having two All - Star Games .
