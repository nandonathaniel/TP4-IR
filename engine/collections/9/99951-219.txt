The Boston Globe described Firefly as a `` wonderful , imaginative mess brimming with possibility '' . The review further notes the difference between the new series and other programs was that those shows `` burst onto the scene with slick pilots and quickly deteriorate into mediocrity ... Firefly is on the opposite creative journey . '' Jason Snell called the show one of the best on television , and one `` with the most potential for future brilliance '' .
