Moneyline bets do not have a spread or handicap , and require the chosen team to win the game outright . The favoured team pays lower odds than does the underdog , thus , it acts mainly as an enticement to take the underdog for a better payout . Sometimes a bettor may couple this type of bet on the favored team to increase the payout of a parlay . Spread betting are wagers that are made against the spread . The spread , or line , is a number assigned by the bookmakers which handicaps one team and favors another when two teams play each other and one is perceived as being more likely to win . The favorite `` takes '' points from the final score and the underdog `` gives '' points . This number can also be in increments of half - a-point (. 5 ) even though very few sports have . 5 point scoring ( i.e. , The Ryder Cup )
