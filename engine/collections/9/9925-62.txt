Hearing and balance are both generated in the inner ear . The movement of liquids within the inner ear is generated by motion ( for balance ) and transmitted vibrations generated by the ossicles ( for sound ) . This creates a nerve signal that passes through the vestibulocochlear nerve . From here , it passes through to the cochlear nuclei , the superior olivary nucleus , the medial geniculate nucleus , and finally the auditory radiation to the auditory cortex .
