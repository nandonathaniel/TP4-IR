`` This training differs from that undertaken by MDs in that it includes therapies not taught at medical schools , such as botanical medicine , clinical nutrition , naturopathic manipulation , and homeopathy . Homeopathy is highly disputed , having been called `` quackery '' by Oliver Wendell Holmes in 1842 or more recently `` pseudoscience '' by the Committee for Sceptical Inquiry , though some studies have shown positive effects from homeopathic treatment . Naturopathic schools also teach vitalism , a concept that has been called irreconcilable with modern science and medicine . NDs are not required to engage in residency training . In 2005 , the Massachusetts Medical Society opposed licensure in the commonwealth based on concerns over the facts that NDs are not required to participated in residency , and may also suggest inappropriate or harmful treatments .
