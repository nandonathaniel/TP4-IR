On 13 April 2015 , former New Zealand Cricket CEO and head of the Tourism Industry Association NZ , Martin Snedden proposed a possible New Zealand and Australia joint bid for either the 2026 or 2030 FIFA World Cup . Australia had also unsuccessfully bid for the 2022 World Cup . Snedden 's vision was for both the Asian Football Confederation and Oceania Football Confederation working together to achieve the event . Snedden recognized there would be plenty of hurdles to leap . On the idea of a potential bid , New Zealand 's then - Prime Minister John Key said the decision on such a bid would be `` a long way away '' . However , Football Federation Australia promptly dismissed the idea of a joint bid , saying Australia was not currently interested in bidding . Nonetheless , conversations with the New Zealand government would continue .
