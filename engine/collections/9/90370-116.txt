The largest and last major freighter wrecked on the lakes was the SS Edmund Fitzgerald , which sank on November 10 , 1975 , just over 17 miles ( 30 km ) offshore from Whitefish Point on Lake Superior . The largest loss of life in a shipwreck out on the lakes may have been that of Lady Elgin , wrecked in 1860 with the loss of around 400 lives on Lake Michigan . In an incident at a Chicago dock in 1915 , the SS Eastland rolled over while loading passengers , killing 841 .
