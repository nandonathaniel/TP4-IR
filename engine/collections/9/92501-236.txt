The board sat in the capital city of each department and exercised jurisdiction throughout the entire territory of the department . It could issue decrees and resolutions that it deemed necessary either on the suggestion of the governor or on its own initiative . It could approve budgets , fix the amount of taxes , request the intervention of the Accounts Tribunal for advice concerning departmental finances or administration , and remove from office -- at the request of the governor -- members of nonelective local departmental boards . The board also supervised local public services ; public health ; and primary , secondary , preparatory , industrial , and artistic education . Although Montevideo was the smallest department in terms of area ( divided into twenty - three geographic zones that generally coincided with the electoral zones ) , its departmental board had sixty - five members in 1990 ; all other departments had thirty - one - member boards and a five - member executive council appointed by the departmental board , with proportional representation from the principal political parties .
