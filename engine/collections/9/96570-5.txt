Meristematic cells are incompletely or not at all differentiated , and are capable of continued cellular division ( youthful ) . Furthermore , the cells are small and protoplasm fills the cell completely . The vacuoles are extremely small . The cytoplasm does not contain differentiated plastids ( chloroplasts or chromoplasts ) , although they are present in rudimentary form ( proplastids ) . Meristematic cells are packed closely together without intercellular cavities . The cell wall is a very thin primary cell wall .
