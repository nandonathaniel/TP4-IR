Spores are usually haploid and unicellular and are produced by meiosis in the sporangium of a diploid sporophyte . Under favourable conditions the spore can develop into a new organism using mitotic division , producing a multicellular gametophyte , which eventually goes on to produce gametes . Two gametes fuse to form a zygote which develops into a new sporophyte . This cycle is known as alternation of generations .
