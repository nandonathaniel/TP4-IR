Some dental researchers have cautioned against the use of dental explorers to find caries , in particular sharp ended explorers . In cases where a small area of tooth has begun demineralizing but has not yet cavitated , the pressure from the dental explorer could cause a cavity . Since the carious process is reversible before a cavity is present , it may be possible to arrest caries with fluoride and remineralize the tooth surface . When a cavity is present , a restoration will be needed to replace the lost tooth structure .
