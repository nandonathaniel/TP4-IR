Lithium fluoride is the only alkali metal halide that is poorly soluble in water , and lithium hydroxide is the only alkali metal hydroxide that is not deliquescent . Conversely , lithium perchlorate and other lithium salts with large anions that can not be polarised are much more stable than the analogous compounds of the other alkali metals , probably because Li has a high solvation energy . This effect also means that most simple lithium salts are commonly encountered in hydrated form , because the anhydrous forms are extremely hygroscopic : this allows salts like lithium chloride and lithium bromide to be used in dehumidifiers and air - conditioners .
