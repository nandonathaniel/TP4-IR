The activity of NMDA receptors is also strikingly sensitive to the changes in pH , and partially inhibited by the ambient concentration of H under physiological conditions . The level of inhibition by H is greatly reduced in receptors containing the NR1a subtype , which contains the positively charged insert Exon 5 . The effect of this insert may be mimicked by positively charged polyamines and aminoglycosides , explaining their mode of action .
