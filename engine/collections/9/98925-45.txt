The suspension of the DMC - 12 is a four - wheel independent suspension , coil springs , and telescopic shock absorbers . The front suspension uses double wishbones , while the rear is a multi-link setup . In its original development stages , the car is said to have handled quite well . Design drawings clearly show that the design met NHTSA minimum bumper and headlight heights of the time . Many owners have subsequently replaced or modified the front springs to return the front height to the original design specification .
