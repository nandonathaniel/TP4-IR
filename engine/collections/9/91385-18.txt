Various enzymes ; there are three major enzymes found in saliva : Î± - amylase ( EC3. 2.1. 1 ) , or ptyalin , secreted by the acinar cells of the parotid and submandibular glands , starts the digestion of starch before the food is even swallowed ; it has a pH optimum of 7.4 Lingual lipase , which is secreted by the acinar cells of the sublingual gland ; has a pH optimum around 4.0 so it is not activated until entering the acidic environment of the stomach Kallikrein , an enzyme that proteolytically cleaves high - molecular - weight kininogen to produce bradykinin , which is a vasodilator ; it is secreted by the acinar cells of all three major salivary glands Antimicrobial enzymes that kill bacteria Lysozyme Salivary lactoperoxidase Lactoferrin Immunoglobulin A Proline - rich proteins ( function in enamel formation , Ca - binding , microbe killing and lubrication ) Minor enzymes include salivary acid phosphatases A + B , N - acetylmuramoyl - L - alanine amidase , NAD ( P ) H dehydrogenase ( quinone ) , superoxide dismutase , glutathione transferase , class 3 aldehyde dehydrogenase , glucose - 6 - phosphate isomerase , and tissue kallikrein ( function unknown )
