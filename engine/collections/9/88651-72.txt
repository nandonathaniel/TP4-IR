Evan Daugherty initially wrote the screenplay in 2003 , when he was studying at NYU . At the time reboots of fairy tales were not a popular film genre and according to Daugherty `` no one really knew what to do with it '' More problems came when the release of Terry Gilliam 's The Brothers Grimm ( 2005 ) flopped at the box office which caused potential buyers to be hesitant about the script . The script was finally greenlit after the success of Tim Burton 's Alice in Wonderland ( 2010 ) .
