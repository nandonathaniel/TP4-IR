Meg is so unpopular at school that one student fires a nail gun into his own stomach twice ( in shop class ) in order to avoid a date with her , and then in a later episode shoots his own brother as an excuse not to go to a dance with her the following night . On another occasion , Meg and Lois are looking for new clothes for Meg , but with no luck ( a saleswoman ended up pouring gasoline on herself , lighting a match , catching fire , and then jumping out of a window after looking at Meg in a pair of jeans ) . However , she is sought by nerd Neil Goldman . In `` 8 Simple Rules for Buying My Teenage Daughter '' , Neil starts dating a girl named Cecilia , Meg becomes instantly jealous and pretends to date Jake Tucker to make him jealous . This leads to her signing a contract to become Neil 's girlfriend and ( not knowing at first ) his slave , but she gets him to tear up the contract after Lois seduces him . Perverted neighbor Glenn Quagmire has shown a repeated interest in her , mostly due to his very low standards , asking if she has reached the age of consent . Quagmire comes close to succeeding when Lois tells Peter to back off after he was ruining Meg and Quagmire 's ' dates ' . Then , they rescue Meg after Glenn takes her to his cabin , Peter and Lois arriving in time before anything happens . In several episodes she is shown dating , including stories with characters Mayor Adam West and nudist Jeff Campbell . She also loses her virginity unknowingly on live television to Saturday Night Live host Jimmy Fallon after having a drastic makeover ; but , before all that happens , she goes out with a rebel at her school named Craig Hoffman . In `` Jerome is the New Black '' , Jerome , an old flame of Lois 's and Peter 's new friend , admits to having sex with Meg , to which Peter replies indifferently .
