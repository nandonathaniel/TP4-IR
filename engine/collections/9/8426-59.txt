Many more of the control codes have been given meanings quite different from their original ones . The `` escape '' character ( ESC , code 27 ) , for example , was intended originally to allow sending other control characters as literals instead of invoking their meaning . This is the same meaning of `` escape '' encountered in URL encodings , C language strings , and other systems where certain characters have a reserved meaning . Over time this meaning has been co-opted and has eventually been changed . In modern use , an ESC sent to the terminal usually indicates the start of a command sequence usually in the form of a so - called `` ANSI escape code '' ( or , more properly , a `` Control Sequence Introducer '' ) from ECMA - 48 ( 1972 ) and its successors , beginning with ESC followed by a `` ( '' ( left - bracket ) character . An ESC sent from the terminal is most often used as an out - of - band character used to terminate an operation , as in the TECO and vi text editors . In graphical user interface ( GUI ) and windowing systems , ESC generally causes an application to abort its current operation or to exit ( terminate ) altogether .
