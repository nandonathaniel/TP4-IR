Advancements in medical technology also allow for more services that formerly required expensive hospital stays to be delivered via ambulatory care . For example , in California , research has predicted the total consumption of hospital days per person will decline from 4 days in 2010 to 3.2 days in 2020 to 2.5 days in 2030 . In contrast , the number of ambulatory visits per person will increase from 3.2 visits per person in 2010 to 3.6 visits per person in 2020 to 4.2 visits in 2030 .
