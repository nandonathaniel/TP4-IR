Another similar experiment was done in 1996 -- 2002 by Hoover et al. on the relationship between the parasitic brown - headed cowbird and a host , the prothonotary warbler , Protonotaria citrea . In their experiment , researchers manipulated the cowbird egg removal and cowbird access to the predator proof nests of the warbler . They found that 56 % of egg ejected nests were depredated upon in comparison to 6 % of non-ejected nests when cowbirds were not prevented from getting to the hosts ' nest . Of the nests that were rebuilt by hosts that had previously been predated upon , 85 % of those were destroyed . The number of young produced by the hosts that ejected eggs dropped 60 % compared to those that accepted the cowbird eggs .
