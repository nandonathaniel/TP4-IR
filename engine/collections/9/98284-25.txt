Through the work of Albert Einstein , Satyendra Nath Bose , Louis de Broglie , and many others , current scientific theory holds that all particles also have a wave nature . This has been verified not only for elementary particles but also for compound particles like atoms and even molecules . In fact , according to traditional formulations of non-relativistic quantum mechanics , wave -- particle duality applies to all objects , even macroscopic ones ; although the wave properties of macroscopic objects can not be detected due to their small wavelengths .
