where x ^ i ( \ displaystyle ( \ hat ( x ) ) _ ( i ) ) represents a unit vector in the x i ( \ displaystyle x_ ( i ) ) direction for 1 ≤ i ≤ 3 ( \ displaystyle 1 \ leq i \ leq 3 ) . This type of generalized derivative can be seen as the derivative of a scalar , f , with respect to a vector , x ( \ displaystyle \ mathbf ( x ) ) , and its result can be easily collected in vector form .
