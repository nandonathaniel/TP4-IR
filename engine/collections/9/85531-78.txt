There are two types of status for conscientious objectors . If a person objects only to combat but not to service in the military , then the person could be given noncombatant service in the military without training of weapons . If the person objects to all military service , then the person could be ordered to `` alternative service '' with a job `` deemed to make a meaningful contribution to the maintenance of the national health , safety , and interest '' .
