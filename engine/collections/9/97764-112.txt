The American scholar Claudia Johnson defended the novel from the criticism that it has an unrealistic fairy - tale quality . One critic , Mary Poovey , wrote the `` romantic conclusion '' of Pride and Prejudice is an attempt to hedge the conflict between the `` individualistic perspective inherent in the bourgeois value system and the authoritarian hierarchy retained from traditional , paternalistic society '' . Johnson wrote that Austen 's view of a power structure capable of reformation was not an `` escape '' from conflict . Johnson wrote the `` outrageous unconventionality '' of Elizabeth Bennet was in Austen 's own time very daring , especially given the strict censorship that was imposed in Britain by the Prime Minister , William Pitt , in the 1790s when Austen wrote Pride and Prejudice .
