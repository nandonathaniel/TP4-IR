In many liturgical Christian denominations , Good Friday , Holy Saturday , and Easter Sunday form the Easter Triduum . Lent is a season of grief that necessarily ends with a great celebration of Easter . Thus , it is known in Eastern Orthodox circles as the season of `` Bright Sadness '' . It is a season of sorrowful reflection which is punctuated by breaks in the fast on Sundays .
