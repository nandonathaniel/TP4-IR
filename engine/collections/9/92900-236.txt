The taxability of alcoholic beverages is slightly complicated . In Pennsylvania , alcohol is sold to businesses and consumers through the Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board ( PLCB ) . The PLCB always charges sales tax directly to the purchasing entity . Therefore , if a consumer purchases alcohol in PLCB stores , the sales tax is assessed at the point of purchase , but if a consumer purchases alcohol at a licensed business ( such as a bar or restaurant ) , the sales tax is not applied because it had already been paid when the business purchased the alcohol from the PLCB . The PLCB charges an additional 18 % levy on liquor and wine , but this tax is always included in the price regardless of the purchasing location . Beer is subject to an excise of $0.08 per gallon .
