In April 1961 , Khrushchev gained an impression that Kennedy is not very smart when he saw Washington supporting the failed invasion of Cuba by anti-communist exiles which were than left to their fate . Khrushchev decided to alarm rather than appease the president . He soon revealed his intention of signing the separate peace treaty with East Germany that would abolish allied rights in West Berlin . One of his intentions was therefore to get whole of the Berlin . However , this action had risks behind it . The risks that we are taking is justified . If we look at it in the terms of a percentage , there is more than a 95 % chance that there will be no war . It meant that 5 % was an actual chance of having a war . Khrushchev 's assumptions about Kennedy were false . He made clear that the chance of having a war was bigger that 5 % . He showed the unpredictability of US 's policy . All though Soviet forces were not on high alert , the plans were nonetheless changed to deal with the consequences of the Kennedy 's actions . It was then decided to block the access of the West Berlin from the East . That is when the construction of the wall started .
