Paris grew in population from about 400,000 in 1640 to 650,000 in 1780 . A new boulevard , the Champs - Élysées , extended the city west to Étoile , while the working - class neighbourhood of the Faubourg Saint - Antoine on the eastern site of the city grew more and more crowded with poor migrant workers from other regions of France .
