Modern North American football has its origins in various games , all known as `` football '' , played at public schools in England in the mid-19th century . By the 1840s , students at Rugby School were playing a game in which players were able to pick up the ball and run with it , a sport later known as Rugby football . The game was taken to Canada by British soldiers stationed there and was soon being played at Canadian colleges .
