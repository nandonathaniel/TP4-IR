These early episodes held to no specific generic type , so that any episode from one week to the next might be either comedic or dramatic . Tewksbury 's episodes are also unusual for their use of cross-talk ( a way of having the voices of off - screen characters heard in the background of the soundtrack , just under the voices of the main characters ) . Using this clever directorial twist , Tewksbury realistically portrayed the chaotic , fast - paced , and ever - changing sequence of events ; coordinate and conflicting , that was the daily routine of living in the Douglas household .
