To that end , in September 1786 , after resolving a series of disputes regarding their common border along the Potomac River , delegates of Maryland and Virginia called for a larger assembly to discuss various situations and governing problems to meet at the Maryland state capital on the Chesapeake Bay . The later Annapolis Convention with some additional state representatives joining in the sessions first attempted to look into improving the earlier original Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union . There were enough problems to bear further discussion and deliberation that the Convention called for a wider meeting to recommend changes and meet the next year in the late Spring of 1787 in Philadelphia . The Confederation Congress itself endorsed the Call and issued one on its own further inviting the states to send delegates . After meeting in secret all summer in the Old Pennsylvania State House now having acquired the nickname and new title of Independence Hall , from the famous action here eleven years earlier . The Philadelphia Convention , under the presidency of former General George Washington instead of a series of amendments , or altering the old charter , issued a proposed new Constitution for the United States to replace the 1776 -- 1778 Articles . The Confederation Congress received and submitted the new Constitution document to the states , and the Constitution was later ratified by enough states ( nine were required ) to become operative in June 1788 . On September 12 , 1788 , the Confederation Congress set the date for choosing the new Electors in the Electoral College that was set up for choosing a President as January 7 , 1789 , the date for the Electors to vote for the President as on February 4 , 1789 , and the date for the Constitution to become operative as March 4 , 1789 , when the new Congress of the United States should convene , and that they at a later date set the time and place for the Inauguration of the new first President of the United States .
