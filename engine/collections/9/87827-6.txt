Crawford died in 1857 before the full - size plaster model left his studio . The model , packed into six crates , was shipped from Italy in a small sailing vessel in the spring of 1858 . During the voyage , the ship began to leak and stopped in Gibraltar for repairs . After leaving Gibraltar , the ship began leaking again to the point that it could go no farther than Bermuda , where the model was stored until other transportation could be arranged . Half of the crates finally arrived in New York City in December , but all sections were not in Washington , D.C. until late March 1859 .
