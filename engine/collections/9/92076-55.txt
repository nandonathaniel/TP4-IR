The spring still exists and is now the site of a small modern pumping station . Its water is pure but high in dissolved calcium carbonate leached out of the surrounding limestone . This presented the Romans with significant problems in maintaining the aqueduct , as the carbonates precipitated out of the water during its journey through the conduit . This caused the flow of the aqueduct to become progressively reduced by deposits of calcareous sinter . Another threat was posed by vegetation penetrating the stone lid of the channel . As well as obstructing the flow of the water , dangling roots introduced algae and bacteria that decomposed in a process called biolithogenesis , producing concretions within the conduit . It required constant maintenance by circitores , workers responsible for the aqueduct 's upkeep , who crawled along the conduit scrubbing the walls clean and removing any vegetation .
