For a given object ( e.g. , particle , fluid , field , material ) , if A or Z correspond to properties specific to the object like its charge density , mass density , spin , etc. , its properties can be fixed in the rest frame of that object . Then the Lorentz transformations give the corresponding properties in a frame moving relative to the object with constant velocity . This breaks some notions taken for granted in non-relativistic physics . For example , the energy E of an object is a scalar in non-relativistic mechanics , but not in relativistic mechanics because energy changes under Lorentz transformations ; its value is different for various inertial frames . In the rest frame of an object , it has a rest energy and zero momentum . In a boosted frame its energy is different and it appears to have a momentum . Similarly , in non-relativistic quantum mechanics the spin of a particle is a constant vector , but in relativistic quantum mechanics spin s depends on relative motion . In the rest frame of the particle , the spin pseudovector can be fixed to be its ordinary non-relativistic spin with a zero timelike quantity s , however a boosted observer will perceive a nonzero timelike component and an altered spin .
