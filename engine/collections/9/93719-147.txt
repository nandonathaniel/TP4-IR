A 1945 study by sociologist Bernard Berelson found that during the 1945 New York newspaper strike , New Yorkers exhibited a virtual addiction to news , describing themselves as `` lost '' , `` nervous '' , `` isolated '' , and `` suffering '' due to the withdrawal . Television news has become still further embedded in everyday life , with specific programming anticipated at different times of day . Children tend to find the news boring , too serious , or emotionally disturbing . They come to perceive news as characteristic of adulthood , and begin watching television news in their teenage years because of the adult status it confers .
