State finances also relied heavily on borrowing , both private ( from the great banking families in Europe ) and public . The most important public source for borrowing was through the system of rentes sur l'HÃ´tel de Ville of Paris , a kind of government bond system offering investors annual interest . This system first came to use in 1522 under Francis I .
