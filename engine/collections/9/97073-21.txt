Different equipment is used when preparing an angel food cake at home or in a small bakery as opposed to a large scale production . Many recipes found in cookbooks advise bakers to whip the egg whites in a copper bowl . The theory behind this is that the whisk incorporates copper particles or ovotransferrin , which is attached to copper particles , into the egg whites , improving the flexibility and stability of the foam . Some research has found that the copper significantly increases the dilatational elasticity , which is the elasticity of the protein cell wall at the interface of air / water .
