Idealism is the form of monism that sees the world as consisting of minds , mental contents and or consciousness . Idealists are not faced with explaining how minds arise from bodies : rather , the world , bodies and objects are regarded as mere appearances held by minds . However , accounting for the mind -- body problem is not usually the main motivation for idealism ; rather , idealists tend to be motivated by skepticism , intentionality , and the unique nature of ideas . Idealism is prominent in Eastern religious and philosophical thought . It has gone through several cycles of popularity and neglect in the history of Western philosophy .
