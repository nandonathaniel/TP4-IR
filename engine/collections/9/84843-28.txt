`` I had just gone through an experience that made me write this song about like knowing the second you see someone like , ' Oh , this is going to be interesting . It 's going to be dangerous , but look at me going in there anyway ... I think that for me , it was the first time I ever kind of noticed that in myself , like when you are curious about something you know might be bad for you , but you know that you are going to go for it anyway because if you do n't , you 'll have greater regrets about not seeing where that would go , but I think that for me it all went along with this record that was pushing boundaries , like the sound of this record pushes boundaries , it was writing about something I had n't written before .
