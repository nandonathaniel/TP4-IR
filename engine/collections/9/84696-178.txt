Partly as a result of the developing split in the women 's movement , in 1868 the New England Woman Suffrage Association ( NEWSA ) , the first major political organization in the U.S. with women 's suffrage as its goal , was formed . The planners for the NEWSA 's founding convention worked to attract Republican support and seated leading Republican politicians , including a U.S. senator , on the speaker 's platform . Amid increasing confidence that the Fifteenth Amendment , which would in effect enfranchise black men , was assured of passage , Lucy Stone , a future president of the NEWSA , showed her preference for enfranchising both women and African Americans by unexpectedly introducing a resolution calling for the Republican Party to `` drop its watchword of ' Manhood Suffrage ' '' and to support universal suffrage instead . Despite opposition by Frederick Douglass and others , Stone convinced the meeting to approve the resolution . Two months later , however , when the Fifteenth Amendment was in danger of becoming stalled in Congress , Stone backed away from that position and declared that `` Woman must wait for the Negro . ''
