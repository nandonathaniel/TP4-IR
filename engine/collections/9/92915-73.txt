The city marina is on one of three islands at a narrow point on the 13 - mile - long ( 21 km ) bay and increases in elevation slightly as it spreads north , south , and especially to the east . The city gently encroaches at least two miles ( 3.2 km ) eastward into primarily Redwood and Douglas - fir second growth forests . The city has a traditional grid that generally radiates toward the points of the compass . Most post-1970 houses were built in formerly clear cut forested areas .
