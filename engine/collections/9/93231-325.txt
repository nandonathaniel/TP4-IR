Phnom Penh , the capital of Cambodia , fell to the communist Khmer Rouge on 17 April 1975 . Under the leadership of Pol Pot , the Khmer Rouge would eventually kill 1 -- 3 million Cambodians out of a population of around 8 million , in one of the bloodiest genocides in history . An estimated 1,386,734 victims of execution have been counted in mass graves , while demographic analysis suggests that the policies of the regime caused between 1.7 and 2.5 million excess deaths altogether ( including disease and starvation ) . After repeated border clashes in 1978 , Vietnam invaded Democratic Kampuchea ( Cambodia ) and ousted the Khmer Rouge , who were being supported by China , in the Cambodian -- Vietnamese War . In response , China invaded Vietnam in 1979 . The two countries fought a brief border war , known as the Sino - Vietnamese War . From 1978 to 1979 , some 450,000 ethnic Chinese left Vietnam by boat as refugees or were expelled . The devastating impact of Khmer Rouge rule contributed to a 1979 famine in Cambodia , during which an additional 300,000 Cambodians perished .
