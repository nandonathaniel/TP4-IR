In Ware v. Hylton , 3 U.S. ( 3 Dall . ) 199 ( 1796 ) , the United States Supreme Court for the first time applied the Supremacy Clause to strike down a state statute . Virginia had passed a statute during the Revolutionary War allowing the state to confiscate debt payments by Virginia citizens to British creditors . The Supreme Court found that this Virginia statute was inconsistent with the Treaty of Paris with Britain , which protected the rights of British creditors . Relying on the Supremacy Clause , the Supreme Court held that the treaty superseded Virginia 's statute , and that it was the duty of the courts to declare Virginia 's statute `` null and void '' .
