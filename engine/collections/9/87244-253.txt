Notes : During the halftime , rival network Fox aired a special live episode of In Living Color , one of the first deliberate attempts at counter-programming . The show drew over 22 million viewers away from the Super Bowl telecast . In mid-1992 , citing this , Select Productions pitched the concept of exclusively featuring live concert - type performances from top contemporary musical artists . The concept and pitch is attributed to Select Productions ' employee Rick Lewis and prompted the change of the 1993 halftime show to showcase Michael Jackson .
