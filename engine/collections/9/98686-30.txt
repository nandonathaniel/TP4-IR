Almost six months later at The Forum in Inglewood , California , on September 10 , 1973 , Ali avenged the Norton loss but only after he got the return by a split decision . Norton weighed in at 205 lbs ( 5 pounds lighter than his first match with Ali ) and boxing scribes discussed that his preparation was too intense and that perhaps he had overtrained . There were some furious exchanges in this hard - fought battle . From Ali 's point of view , a loss here would have seriously dented his claim of ever being `` The Greatest . '' During the ABC broadcast of the fight , broadcaster ( and Ali confidant and friend ) Howard Cosell repeatedly told viewers a dancing and jabbing Ali was dominating the action despite Norton 's constant offense and Ali 's inability to penetrate Norton 's awkward defensive style . The close and controversial scoring was in stark contrast to Cosell 's fight - long insistence that Ali had matters well in hand .
