According to the World Health Organization ( WHO ) , the United States spent more on health care per capita ( $7,146 ) , and more on health care as percentage of its GDP ( 15.2 % ) , than any other nation in 2008 . In 2010 , 49.9 million residents or 16.3 % of the population reported not carrying health insurance to the U.S. Census . Of that number 18.3 million had annual household incomes at or greater than $50,000 , 9.5 million had household incomes of $75,000 or higher , 16.2 million had household incomes of less than $25,000 , 27.2 million were under age 35 , and 9.7 million were non-citizens . The Census has stated that its surveys likely underreport insurance coverage . For example , a quality control analysis revealed that 16.9 % of those enrolled in Medicaid incorrectly reported being uninsured . Analyses have also shown that millions of uninsured are eligible for coverage through programs like Medicaid but have not signed up or have let their enrollments expire . According to Physicians for a National Health Program , this lack of insurance causes roughly 48,000 unnecessary deaths per year . The group 's methodology has been criticized by John C. Goodman for not looking at cause of death or tracking insurance status changes over time , including the time of death . A 2009 study by former Clinton policy adviser Richard Kronick found no increased mortality from being uninsured after certain risk factors were controlled for .
