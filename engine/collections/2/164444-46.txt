At the time of the Siege of Boston , the Continental Army at Cambridge , Massachusetts , in June 1775 , is estimated to have numbered from 14 -- 16,000 men from New England ( though the actual number may have been as low as 11,000 because of desertions ) . Until Washington 's arrival , it remained under the command of Artemas Ward , while John Thomas acted as executive officer and Richard Gridley commanded the artillery corps and was chief engineer .
