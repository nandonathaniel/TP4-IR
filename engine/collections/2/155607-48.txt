It was originally thought that both apocrine and eccrine sweat glands used merocrine secretion , where vesicles in the gland released sweat via exocytosis , leaving the entire cell intact . More recent studies have revealed that apocrine glands release sweat in the hair follicle via apocrine secretion , where portions of the cell are actually pinched off , and disintegrate later to excrete sweat .
