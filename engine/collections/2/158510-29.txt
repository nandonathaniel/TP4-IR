Although `` Atomic Dog '' is now regarded a classic in black popular music , it was at first held back from radio stations . George Clinton 's bad reputation in the industry , his political consciousness ( as seen in his previous albums and recordings ) , and a general move towards more youthful - looking acts , kept his songs from being circulated on radio stations . Only after very strong sales was the song finally put on the air . The single `` Atomic Dog '' was released in December 1982 and reached # 1 on the R&B charts , but missed the Hot 100 by just one position .
