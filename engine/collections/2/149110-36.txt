The Egyptians referred to the people west of the Nile , ancestral to the Berbers , as Libyans . The Libyans were agriculturalists like the Mauri of Morocco and the Numidians of central and eastern Algeria and Tunis . They were also nomadic , having the horse , and occupied the arid pastures and desert , like the Gaetuli . Berber desert nomads were typically in conflict with Berber coastal agriculturalists .
