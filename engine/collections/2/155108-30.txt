In June 1969 , 21 - year - old Norma L. McCorvey discovered she was pregnant with her third child . She returned to Dallas , Texas , where friends advised her to assert falsely that she had been raped in order to obtain a legal abortion ( with the understanding that Texas law allowed abortion in cases of rape and incest ) . However , this scheme failed because there was no police report documenting the alleged rape . She attempted to obtain an illegal abortion , but found that the unauthorized facility had been closed down by the police . Eventually , she was referred to attorneys Linda Coffee and Sarah Weddington . ( McCorvey would end up giving birth before the case was decided . )
