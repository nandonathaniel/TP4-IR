In order to eliminate any trademark concerns with PK in the future , the band decided to change its name . The band decided on Night Riots in order to better encapsulate their sound ; yearning for a `` latchkey feel '' , they cited the energy of shows that take place at night as determining their new name . They also explained that , while PK was a `` great name '' , its meaning was difficult to interpret and failed to project any imagery . Night Riots sought to raise money through crowd funding website Indiegogo to release their upcoming extended play ( EP ) , where they accumulated $ 12,000 . The money was used to independently release Young Lore on July 30 , 2013 .
