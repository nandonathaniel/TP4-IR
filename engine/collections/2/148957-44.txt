The Commons may indicate its lack of support for the Government by rejecting a motion of confidence or by passing a motion of no confidence . Confidence and no confidence motions are phrased explicitly , for instance : `` That this House has no confidence in Her Majesty 's Government . '' Many other motions were considered confidence issues , even though not explicitly phrased as such . In particular , important bills that form a part of the Government 's agenda were formerly considered matters of confidence , as is the annual Budget . When a Government has lost the confidence of the House of Commons , the prime minister is obliged either to resign , making way for another MP who can command confidence , or to request the monarch to dissolve Parliament , thereby precipitating a general election .
