By the late 1870s , Austrian territorial ambitions in both the Italian peninsula and Central Europe had been thwarted by the rise of Italy and Germany as new national powers . With the decline and failed reforms of the Ottoman Empire , Slavic discontent in the occupied Balkans grew , and both Russia and Austria - Hungary saw an opportunity to expand in this region . In 1876 , Russia offered to partition the Balkans , but Hungarian statesman Gyula Andrássy declined because Austria - Hungary was already a `` saturated '' state and it could not cope with additional territories . The whole Empire was thus drawn into a new style of diplomatic brinkmanship , first conceived of by Andrássy , centring on the province of Bosnia and Herzegovina , a predominantly Slav area still under the control of the Ottoman Empire .
