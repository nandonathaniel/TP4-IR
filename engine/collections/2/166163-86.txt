Tim Rice said Jesus was seen through Judas ' eyes as a mere human being . Some Christians found this remark , as well as the fact that the musical did not show the resurrection , to be blasphemous . While the actual resurrection was not shown , the closing scene of the movie subtly alludes to the resurrection ( though , according to Jewison 's commentary on the DVD release , the scene was not planned this way ) . Some found Judas too sympathetic ; in the film , it states that he wants to give the thirty pieces of silver to the poor , which , although Biblical , leaves out his ulterior motives ( see also `` Everything 's Alright '' ) . Biblical purists pointed out a small number of deviations from biblical text as additional concerns ; for example , Pilate himself having the dream instead of his wife , and Catholics argue the line `` for all you care , this bread could be my body '' is too Protestant in theology , although Jesus does say in the next lines , `` This is my blood you drink / This is my body you eat '' .
