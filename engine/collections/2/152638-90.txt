Kathar√©vousa is a purified form of the Greek Language midway between modern and ancient forms set in train during the early nineteenth century by Greek intellectual and revolutionary leader Adamantios Korais , intended to return the Greek language closer to its ancient form . Its influence , in recent years , evolved toward a more formal role , and it came to be used primarily for official purposes such as diplomacy , politics , and other forms of official documentation . It has nevertheless had significant effects on the Greek language as it is still written and spoken today , and both vocabulary and grammatical and syntactical forms have re-entered Modern Greek via Katharevousa .
