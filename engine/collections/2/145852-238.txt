Initially , the Whig interpretation of Magna Carta and its role in constitutional history remained dominant during the 19th century . The historian William Stubbs 's Constitutional History of England , published in the 1870s , formed the high - water mark of this view . Stubbs argued that Magna Carta had been a major step in the shaping of the English nation , and he believed that the barons at Runnymede in 1215 were not just representing the nobility , but the people of England as a whole , standing up to a tyrannical ruler in the form of King John .
