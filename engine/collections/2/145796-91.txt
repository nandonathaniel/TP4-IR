Another is the recent court case United States v. Antoine Jones . A nightclub owner was linked to a drug trafficking stash house via a law enforcement GPS tracking device attached to his car . It was placed there without a warrant , which caused a serious conviction obstacle for federal prosecutors in court . Through the years the case rose all the way to the United States Supreme Court where the conviction was overturned in favor of the defendant . The court found that increased monitoring of suspects caused by such legislation like the Patriot Act directly put the suspects ' Constitutional rights in jeopardy .
