The two bailiwicks have been administered separately since the late 13th century ; each has its own independent laws , elections , and representative bodies ( although in modern times , politicians from the islands ' legislatures are in regular contact ) . Any institution common to both is the exception rather than the rule . The Bailiwick of Guernsey is divided into three jurisdictions -- Guernsey , Alderney and Sark -- each with its own legislature .
