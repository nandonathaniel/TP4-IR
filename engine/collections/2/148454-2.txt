Squad numbers are used in association football to identify and distinguish players that are on the field . Numbers were originally used to also indicate position , with starting players being assigned numbers 1 -- 11 , although these numbers often bear little or no significance in the modern game other than the players ' favourite numbers and the numbers available . However , numbers 1 -- 11 are often still worn by players of the previously associated position .
