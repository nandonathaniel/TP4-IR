During the European Age of Enlightenment , the belief that a `` tooth worm '' caused caries was also no longer accepted in the European medical community . Pierre Fauchard , known as the father of modern dentistry , was one of the first to reject the idea that worms caused tooth decay and noted that sugar was detrimental to the teeth and gingiva . In 1850 , another sharp increase in the prevalence of caries occurred and is believed to be a result of widespread diet changes . Prior to this time , cervical caries was the most frequent type of caries , but increased availability of sugar cane , refined flour , bread , and sweetened tea corresponded with a greater number of pit and fissure caries .
