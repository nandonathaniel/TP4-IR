The South West Africa People 's Organization ( SWAPO ) outlined its battle plan for liberating South West Africa ( now Namibia ) from the domination of South Africa .

At a press conference in New York , Bob Hermann and William D. Cox announced the founding of the North American Professional Soccer League , with plans to play professional soccer during the autumn of 1967 in 11 cities . The league , renamed the National Professional Soccer League , would play in ten cities in 1967 , and then merge half of its teams with a rival organization , the United Soccer Association to create the North American Soccer League . Thirty African members of the United Nations demanded that the UN Security Council meet immediately to invoke harsher penalties against the white minority government of Rhodesia . The protest came as three envoys of Rhodesian Prime Minister Ian Smith were in London to negotiate with the United Kingdom .
