The next day , the Prince arrives with the news he will marry whomsoever the slipper fits . The two sisters fight and quarrel over who the shoe will fit . It is traditional to have one sister concealing a false leg beneath her skirt in an attempt to fool the prince . Another tradition is that one sister has yards and yards of multicoloured stockings beneath her skirt , which must be comically removed before trying the shoe on . When the shoe does not fit , the Prince allows Cinderella ( who has either been tricked into leaving the house or locked in the cellar ) to try it on . When the shoe fits , the stepsisters are horrified . Their fates are dependent upon which version is being told . Sometimes they are forgiven for their cruelty , other times they are demoted to servants in the prince 's castle , or sometimes the Baron Hardup at last puts his foot down and stands up to them .
