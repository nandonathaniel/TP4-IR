An I / O psychologist , whether an academic , a consultant , or an employee , must maintain high ethical standards . The APA 's ethical principles apply to I / O psychologists . For example , ethically , the I / O psychologist should only accept projects for which he or she is qualified . With more organizations becoming global , it is important that when an I / O psychologist works outside her or his home country , the psychologist is aware of rules , regulations , and cultures of the organizations and countries in which the psychologist works , while adhering to the ethical standards set at home .
