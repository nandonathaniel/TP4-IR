The original design of Darth Vader 's costume did not originally include a helmet . The idea that Vader should wear a breathing apparatus was first proposed by concept artist Ralph McQuarrie during preproduction discussions for Star Wars with George Lucas in 1975 . In an interview with Star Wars Insider Magazine , McQuarrie stated that Lucas 's artistic direction was to portray a malevolent figure in a cape with Samurai armour . `` For Darth Vader , George ( Lucas ) just said he would like to have a very tall , dark fluttering figure that had a spooky feeling like it came in on the wind . '' McQuarrie noted that the script indicated that Vader would travel between spaceships and needed to survive in the vacuum of space , and he proposed that Vader should wear some sort of space suit . Lucas agreed , and McQuarrie combined a full - face breathing mask with a Samurai helmet , thus creating one of the most iconic designs of space fantasy cinema . McQuarrie 's 1975 production painting of Darth Vader engaged in a lightsaber duel with Deak Starkiller ( a character prototype for Luke Skywalker ) depicts Vader wearing black armour , a flowing cape and an elongated , skull - like mask and helmet . Its similarity to the final design of Vader 's costume demonstrates that McQuarrie 's earliest conception of Vader was so successful that very little needed to be changed for production .
