Sometime afterward , the sons of Jacob by Leah , Bilhah and Zilpah , were feeding his flocks in Shechem . Jacob wanted to know how things were doing , so he asked Joseph to go down there and return with a report . This was the last time he would ever see his son in Hebron . Later that day , the report that Jacob ended up receiving came from Joseph 's brothers who brought before him a coat laden with blood . Jacob identified the coat as the one he made for Joseph . At that moment he cried `` It is my son 's tunic . A wild beast has devoured him . Without doubt Joseph is torn to pieces . '' He rent his clothes and put sackcloth around his waist mourning for days . No one from the house of Jacob could comfort him during this time of bereavement . ( Genesis 37 : 31 -- 35 )
