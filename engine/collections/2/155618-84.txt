Quantum mechanics is essential to understanding the behavior of systems at atomic length scales and smaller . If the physical nature of an atom were solely described by classical mechanics , electrons would not orbit the nucleus , since orbiting electrons emit radiation ( due to circular motion ) and would eventually collide with the nucleus due to this loss of energy . This framework was unable to explain the stability of atoms . Instead , electrons remain in an uncertain , non-deterministic , smeared , probabilistic wave -- particle orbital about the nucleus , defying the traditional assumptions of classical mechanics and electromagnetism .
