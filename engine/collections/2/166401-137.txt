The moment of inertia of a thin rod with constant cross-section s and density ρ and with length l about a perpendicular axis through its centre of mass is determined by integration . Align the x-axis with the rod and locate the origin its centre of mass at the centre of the rod , then I C , rod = ∫∫∫ Q ρ x 2 d V = ∫ − l 2 l 2 ρ x 2 s d x = ρ s x 3 3 − l 2 l 2 = ρ s 3 ( l 3 8 + l 3 8 ) = m l 2 12 , ( \ displaystyle I_ ( C , ( \ text ( rod ) ) ) = \ iiint \ limits _ ( Q ) \ rho \ , x ^ ( 2 ) \ , \ mathrm ( d ) V = \ int _ ( - ( \ frac ( \ ell ) ( 2 ) ) ) ^ ( \ frac ( \ ell ) ( 2 ) ) \ rho \ , x ^ ( 2 ) s \ , \ mathrm ( d ) x = \ left. \ rho s ( \ frac ( x ^ ( 3 ) ) ( 3 ) ) \ right _ ( - ( \ frac ( \ ell ) ( 2 ) ) ) ^ ( \ frac ( \ ell ) ( 2 ) ) = ( \ frac ( \ rho s ) ( 3 ) ) \ left ( ( \ frac ( \ ell ^ ( 3 ) ) ( 8 ) ) + ( \ frac ( \ ell ^ ( 3 ) ) ( 8 ) ) \ right ) = ( \ frac ( m \ ell ^ ( 2 ) ) ( 12 ) ) , ) where m = ρsl is the mass of the rod . The moment of inertia of a thin disc of constant thickness s , radius R , and density ρ about an axis through its centre and perpendicular to its face ( parallel to its axis of rotational symmetry ) is determined by integration . Align the z - axis with the axis of the disc and define a volume element as dV = sr drdθ , then I C , disc = ∫∫∫ Q ρ r 2 d V = ∫ 0 2 π ∫ 0 R ρ r 2 s r d r d θ = 2 π ρ s R 4 4 = 1 2 m R 2 , ( \ displaystyle I_ ( C , ( \ text ( disc ) ) ) = \ iiint \ limits _ ( Q ) \ rho \ , r ^ ( 2 ) \ , \ mathrm ( d ) V = \ int _ ( 0 ) ^ ( 2 \ pi ) \ int _ ( 0 ) ^ ( R ) \ rho r ^ ( 2 ) sr \ , \ mathrm ( d ) r \ , \ mathrm ( d ) \ theta = 2 \ pi \ rho s ( \ frac ( R ^ ( 4 ) ) ( 4 ) ) = ( \ frac ( 1 ) ( 2 ) ) mR ^ ( 2 ) , ) where m = πR ρs is its mass . The moment of inertia of the compound pendulum is now obtained by adding the moment of inertia of the rod and the disc around the pivot point P as , I P = I C , rod + M rod ( L 2 ) 2 + I C , disc + M disc ( L + R ) 2 , ( \ displaystyle I_ ( P ) = I_ ( C , ( \ text ( rod ) ) ) + M_ ( \ text ( rod ) ) \ left ( ( \ frac ( L ) ( 2 ) ) \ right ) ^ ( 2 ) + I_ ( C , ( \ text ( disc ) ) ) + M_ ( \ text ( disc ) ) ( L + R ) ^ ( 2 ) , ) where L is the length of the pendulum . Notice that the parallel axis theorem is used to shift the moment of inertia from the centre of mass to the pivot point of the pendulum .
