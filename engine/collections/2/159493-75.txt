Cognitive behavioral therapy ( CBT ) is a good first therapy approach . Studies have gathered substantial evidence for treatments that are not CBT based as being effective forms of treatment , expanding treatment options for those who do not respond to CBT . Like adults , children may undergo psychotherapy , cognitive - behavioral therapy , or counseling . Family therapy is a form of treatment in which the child meets with a therapist together with the primary guardians and siblings . Each family member may attend individual therapy , but family therapy is typically a form of group therapy . Art and play therapy are also used . Art therapy is most commonly used when the child will not or can not verbally communicate , due to trauma or a disability in which they are nonverbal . Participating in art activities allows the child to express what they otherwise may not be able to communicate to others . In play therapy , the child is allowed to play however they please as a therapist observes them . The therapist may intercede from time to time with a question , comment , or suggestion . This is often most effective when the family of the child plays a role in the treatment .
