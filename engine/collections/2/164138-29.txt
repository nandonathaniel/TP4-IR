Since the September 11 attacks in 2001 , the island is guarded by patrols of the United States Park Police Marine Patrol Unit . Public access is by ferry from either Communipaw Terminal in Liberty State Park or from the Battery at the southern tip of Manhattan . The ferry operator , Hornblower Cruises and Events , also provides service to the nearby Statue of Liberty . A bridge built for transporting materials and personnel during restoration projects connects Ellis Island with Liberty State Park but is not open to the public . The city of New York and the private ferry operator at the time opposed proposals to use it or replace it with a pedestrian bridge .
