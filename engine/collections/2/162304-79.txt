On the morning of March 19 , Serra sang Mass and preached a sermon at the forlorn mission on Presidio Hill . No ship appeared in the bay that morning . But around 3 o'clock in the afternoon , the sails of a ship -- the San Antonio -- came into view on the horizon . It sailed past San Diego Bay , destined for Monterey . When it got to the Santa Barbara Channel , its sailors made landfall to fetch fresh water . There they learned from Indians that the Portol√° expedition had returned south . So the San Antonio also turned south , anchoring in San Diego Bay on March 23 .
