Tyler attempts to deceive the destroyer into stopping its attack , by ejecting debris and a dead crew member out of a torpedo tube , faking their own destruction . However , the destroyer continues to drop depth charges . The crew realizes that Wassner , despite being shackled , is using Morse Code to tap out a signal that the submarine had been captured . So they knock him out . U-571 drops below 600 feet ( 180 m ) , and is damaged by high water pressure . They start to sink , and can only reverse this by ascending uncontrollably. Tyler orders crewman Trigger to submerse himself in the bilge underwater to repressurize the single remaining torpedo tube .
