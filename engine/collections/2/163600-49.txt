However , the universe could be finite , even if its curvature is flat . An easy way to understand this is to consider two - dimensional examples , such as video games where items that leave one edge of the screen reappear on the other . The topology of such games is toroidal and the geometry is flat . Many possible bounded , flat possibilities also exist for three - dimensional space .
