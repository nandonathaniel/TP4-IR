Due to corporate interest in the film surrounding its theme of promoting understanding between different groups , and its inclusion of violence and threats of greater conflict , Schwartz became heavily involved in the storytelling . Bannerman estimated that he spent a week with one of the screenwriters and helped work out the overall themes of tolerance and cooperation . In June 1992 , Schwartz researched Jamestown , Virginia where he absorbed the atmosphere and bought tapes of Native American music and English sea shanties , as well as other music from the early seventeenth century that helped inspire numbers in the film . Schwartz modeled his lyrical writing for people of other ethnicities on that of Oscar Hammerstein II and Sheldon Harnick . `` Colors of the Wind '' was the first song to be written for the film . Gabriel , Goldberg , and Pentecost insisted that the song help define the film 's `` heart and soul '' . Schwartz began `` Colors '' with a few draft ideas for lyrics taking inspiration from Chief Seattle 's letter to the United States Congress . Then , Menken wrote the melody with Schwartz listening at the piano and making suggestions . Schwartz would add lyrics before a session together where they were refined . `` Just Around the Riverbend '' , also composed by Menken and Schwartz , was devised by Schwartz 's wife Carole , with the idea that Pocahontas would have a recurring dream that suggested something coming her way , paving the way for her `` I Want '' song . The song almost did not make it into the completed film when Disney executives doubted whether her song would have the kind of impact they wanted at that point . Schwartz however stated he and Menken `` believed in it very strongly . Indeed , at one point we wrote a different song for that spot , but Alan and I were never as happy with the second song and ultimately everybody at Disney came to feel that way , too . ''
