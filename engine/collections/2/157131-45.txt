The Dillon Drawing Room , which was originally known as the Lee Drawing Room , was renamed in honor of former U.S. Secretary of the Treasury C. Douglas Dillon , who donated its unique wallpaper , a Chinese print from 1770 . Dillon 's wife Phyllis purchased the wallpaper on the recommendation of interior designer Eleanor Brown in 1964 . The wallpaper was removed and refurbished between 1982 and 1988 . The room is furnished with 18th century English pieces , along with Chinese vases from the Ming and Qing ( Kangxi reign ) dynasties . The Dillon Drawing Room is used by resident heads of state and chiefs of government to formally receive visitors .
