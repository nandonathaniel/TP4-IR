As a consequence of Einstein 's theory of special relativity , electricity and magnetism are fundamentally interlinked . Both magnetism lacking electricity , and electricity without magnetism , are inconsistent with special relativity , due to such effects as length contraction , time dilation , and the fact that the magnetic force is velocity - dependent . However , when both electricity and magnetism are taken into account , the resulting theory ( electromagnetism ) is fully consistent with special relativity . In particular , a phenomenon that appears purely electric or purely magnetic to one observer may be a mix of both to another , or more generally the relative contributions of electricity and magnetism are dependent on the frame of reference . Thus , special relativity `` mixes '' electricity and magnetism into a single , inseparable phenomenon called electromagnetism , analogous to how relativity `` mixes '' space and time into spacetime .
