Although dopamine is normally broken down by an oxidoreductase enzyme , it is also susceptible to oxidation by direct reaction with oxygen , yielding quinones plus various free radicals as products . The rate of oxidation can be increased by the presence of ferric iron or other factors . Quinones and free radicals produced by autoxidation of dopamine can poison cells , and there is evidence that this mechanism may contribute to the cell loss that occurs in Parkinson 's disease and other conditions .
