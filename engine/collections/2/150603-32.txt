The term epidemic derives from a word form attributed to Homer 's Odyssey , which later took its medical meaning from the Epidemics , a treatise by Hippocrates . Before Hippocrates , epidemios , epidemeo , epidamos , and other variants had meanings similar to the current definitions of `` indigenous '' or `` endemic . '' Thucydides ' description of the Plague of Athens is considered one of the earliest accounts of a disease epidemic . By the early 17th century , the terms endemic and epidemic referred to contrasting conditions of population - level disease , with the endemic condition at low rates of occurrence and the epidemic condition widespread .
