An interest rate is the amount of interest due per period , as a proportion of the amount lent , deposited or borrowed ( called the principal sum ) . The total interest on an amount lent or borrowed depends on the principal sum , the interest rate , the compounding frequency , and the length of time over which it is lent , deposited or borrowed .
