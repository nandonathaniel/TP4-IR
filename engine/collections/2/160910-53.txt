Elizabeth `` Bess '' Erne is Milly Erne 's daughter and Lassiter 's niece , whom Oldring had sheltered for nearly two decades under the terms of a business deal with the Mormon Elders . She possesses more of a Western personality than her companion Bern Venters , having been born in Texas and raised by cattle rustlers . She also became the most skillful equestrian in the region after Jerry Card 's death . While riding was enjoyable for her , she loved stability the most . When Venters asks her of her history , she says , `` As long as I can remember I 've been locked up there at times , and those times were the only happy ones I ever had . It 's a big cabin high up on a cliff , and I could look out . Then I had dogs and pets I had tamed , and books . There was a spring inside , and food stored , and the men brought me fresh meat . Once I was there one whole winter '' .
