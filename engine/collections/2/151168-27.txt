Following the 2006 convention , IDGA -- now ESA -- found that many exhibitors were worried about the high costs of presenting at the event , spending between $5 and $10 million for their booths . They had also found that a larger proportion of attendees were bloggers and attendees who were not perceived to be industry professionals by vendors , managing to secure access to the conference . These additional attendees diluted the vendors ' ability to reach out to their target audience , retailers and journalists . Both of these reasons had previously caused the COMDEX trade show to shut down . Several large vendors told the ESA that they were going to pull out of the next E3 , which would have had a domino effect on other vendors .
