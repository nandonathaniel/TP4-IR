After suppressing the Bar Kochba revolt , the Romans exiled the Jews of Judea , but not of Galilee and permitted a hereditary Rabbinical Patriarch ( from the House of Hillel , based in Galilee ) to represent the Jews in dealings with the Romans . The most famous of these was Judah haNasi who is credited with compiling the final version of the Mishnah ( a massive body of Jewish religious texts interpreting the Bible ) and with strengthening the educational demands of Judaism by requiring that illiterate Jews be treated as outcasts . As a result , many illiterate Jews may have converted to Christianity . Jewish seminaries , such as those at Shefaram and Bet Shearim continued to produce scholars and the best of these became members of the Sanhedrin , which was located first at Tzippori and later at Tiberias . Before the Bar - Kochba uprising , an estimated 2 / 3 of the population of Gallilee and 1 / 3 of the coastal region were Jewish . In the Galillee , many Synagogues have been found dating from this period . However , persecution and the economic crisis that affected the Roman empire in the 3rd century led to further Jewish migration from Syria Palaestina to the more tolerant Persian Sassanid Empire , where a prosperous Jewish community with extensive seminaries existed in the area of Babylon .
