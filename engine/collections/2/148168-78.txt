Of course , Nicholas II remained wary of having to share power with reform - minded bureaucrats . When the pendulum in 1906 elections swung to the left , Nicholas immediately ordered the Duma 's dissolution just after 73 days . Hoping to further squeeze the life out of the assembly , he appointed a tougher prime minister in Petr Stolypin as the liberal Witte 's replacement . Much to Nicholas 's chagrin , Stolypin attempted to bring about acts of reform ( land reform ) , while retaining measures favorable to the regime ( stepping up the number of executions of revolutionaries ) . After the revolution subsided , he was able to bring economic growth back to Russia 's industries , a period which lasted until 1914 . But Stolypin 's efforts did nothing to prevent the collapse of the monarchy , nor seemed to satisfy the conservatives . Stolypin died from a bullet wound by a revolutionary , Dmitry Bogrov , on September 5 , 1911 .
