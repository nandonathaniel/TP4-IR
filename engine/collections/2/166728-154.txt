The Minoans were primarily a mercantile people who engaged in overseas trade . After 1700 BC , their culture indicates a high degree of organization . Minoan - manufactured goods suggest a network of trade with mainland Greece ( notably Mycenae ) , Cyprus , Syria , Anatolia , Egypt , Mesopotamia and westward as far as the coast of Spain . Minoan religion apparently focused on female deities , with women officiants . While historians and archaeologists have long been skeptical of an outright matriarchy , the predominance of female figures in authoritative roles over male ones seems to indicate that Minoan society was matriarchal , and among the most well - supported examples known .
