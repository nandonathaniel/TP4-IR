A curious reaction occurs upon addition of concentrated sulfuric acid to potassium permanganate . Although no reaction may be apparent , the vapor over the mixture will ignite paper impregnated with alcohol . Potassium permanganate and sulfuric acid react to produce some ozone , which has a high oxidising power and rapidly oxidises the alcohol , causing it to combust . As the reaction also produces explosive Mn O , this should only be attempted with great care .
