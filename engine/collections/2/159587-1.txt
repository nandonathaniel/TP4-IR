Each orbital in an atom is characterized by a unique set of values of the three quantum numbers n , l , and m , which respectively correspond to the electron 's energy , angular momentum , and an angular momentum vector component ( the magnetic quantum number ) . Each such orbital can be occupied by a maximum of two electrons , each with its own spin quantum number s . The simple names s orbital , p orbital , d orbital and f orbital refer to orbitals with angular momentum quantum number l = 0 , 1 , 2 and 3 respectively . These names , together with the value of n , are used to describe the electron configurations of atoms . They are derived from the description by early spectroscopists of certain series of alkali metal spectroscopic lines as sharp , principal , diffuse , and fundamental . Orbitals for l > 3 continue alphabetically , omitting j ( g , h , i , k , ... ) because some languages do not distinguish between the letters `` i '' and `` j '' .
