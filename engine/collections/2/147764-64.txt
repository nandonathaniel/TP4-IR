Virtually indexed , physically tagged ( VIPT ) caches use the virtual address for the index and the physical address in the tag . The advantage over PIPT is lower latency , as the cache line can be looked up in parallel with the TLB translation , however the tag can not be compared until the physical address is available . The advantage over VIVT is that since the tag has the physical address , the cache can detect homonyms . VIPT requires more tag bits , as the index bits no longer represent the same address .
