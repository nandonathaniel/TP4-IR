South Beach is traversed by numerical streets which run east - west , starting with Biscayne Street , now popularly known as South Pointe Drive , one block south of First Street and the largely pedestrianized Lincoln Road ( running parallel between 16th and 17th streets ) . It also has 13 principal Roads and Avenues running north - south , which , from the Biscayne Bay side , are Bay Road , West Avenue , Alton Road , Lenox Avenue , Michigan Avenue , Jefferson Avenue , Meridian Avenue , Euclid Avenue , Pennsylvania Avenue , Drexel Avenue , Washington Avenue , Collins Avenue ( State Road A1A ) , and Ocean Drive . There are three smaller avenues ( that do not run the entire length of South Beach ) in the Collins Park area , named Park , Liberty , and James . Most locals agree that South Beach 's northern boundary runs along Dade Boulevard from Lincoln Road on the bay side of the island , and heads east - north - east until it connects with 23rd Street , which forms the northern boundary on the ocean side .
