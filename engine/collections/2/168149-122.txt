Upon gaining a Heaven 's Blade , Glendan 's DITE Technicians format the Heaven 's Blade DITE to the receiver 's specifications . The Heaven 's Blade Receivers are apthetic toward anything else other than fighting or strength ; they usually fight alone or with other Heaven 's Blade only . They showed little interest in the fact that Layfon has betrayed the trust of ophans , Savaris claimed that he should have finish the job by killing Gahard .
