Tyler 's political fortunes were growing ; he was considered as a possible candidate in the legislative deliberation for the 1824 U.S. Senate election . He was nominated in December 1825 for governor of Virginia , a position which was then appointed by the legislature . Tyler was elected 131 -- 81 over John Floyd . The office of governor was powerless under the original Virginia Constitution ( 1776 -- 1830 ) , lacking even veto authority . Tyler enjoyed a prominent oratorical platform but could do little to influence the legislature . His most visible act as governor was delivering the funeral address for former president Jefferson , a Virginian , who had died on July 4 , 1826 . Tyler was deeply devoted to Jefferson , and his eloquent eulogy was well received .
