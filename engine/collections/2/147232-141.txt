Patrick Phelps was the son of the distinguished shipbuilding magnate known as the Blue Star Line and a board member of its trading division . Although timid and easily frightened , he was described as a capable businessman . For the banquet Ciel was hosting in the honor of Georg von Siemens , Phelps was invited as guest . After discovering Siemens 's `` corpse '' on the first night at the Phantomhive manor , he was moved into Ciel 's bedroom ( he was afraid to sleep in his room , which was located next to Siemens 's ) and was unintentionally murdered by Snake 's one of serpents , due the fact Ciel 's scent was masked over his . Although Sebastian was able to get to him shortly after being bitten , he ignored Phelps 's cries for help and left him to die . He is voiced by Takumi Watanabe in Japanese and by Brandon McInnis in English .
