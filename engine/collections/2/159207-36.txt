Current association of dementia and PPIs have been documented in Germany and in research articles denoting how benzimidazole derivatives , astemizole ( AST ) and lansoprazole ( LNS ) interact with anomalous aggregates of tau protein ( neurofibrillary tangles ) . Current theories include the non-selective blockade of sodium - potassium pumps in the brain causing osmotic imbalances or swelling in the cells . ( auth opinion ) Interaction of PPIs with other drug affecting the sodium - potassium pump , e.g. , digoxin , warfarin etc. , has been well documented . Memory has been associated with astrocytes and the alpha3 subunit of adenosine receptor found in hydrogen / Sodium - potassium pumps may be a focal point in dementia . Chronic use of PPIs may cause down regulation of alpha3 subunit increasing damage to astrocytes . Osteopetrosis via TCIRG1 gene has a strong association with pre-senile dementia .
