A JDBC - ODBC bridge consists of a JDBC driver which employs an ODBC driver to connect to a target database . This driver translates JDBC method calls into ODBC function calls . Programmers usually use such a bridge when a given database lacks a JDBC driver , but is accessible through an ODBC driver . Sun Microsystems included one such bridge in the JVM , but viewed it as a stop - gap measure while few JDBC drivers existed . ( The built - in JDBC - ODBC bridge was dropped from the JVM in Java 8 . ) Sun never intended its bridge for production environments , and generally recommended against its use . As of 2008 independent data - access vendors deliver JDBC - ODBC bridges which support current standards for both mechanisms , and which far outperform the JVM built - in . Examples : OpenLink JDBC - ODBC Bridge , SequeLink JDBC - ODBC Bridge .
