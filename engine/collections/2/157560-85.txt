After the first two seasons the show changed its two part episode format and was renamed Justice League Unlimited . As such , the series ran three more seasons from July 2004 to May 2006 . For an unknown reason , the series is available for digital download and in DVD / Blu - ray as only two seasons ( Season 1 containing both Season 1 and 2 episodes and Season 2 containing Season 3 episodes ) . These episodes featured an evolved Justice League that include a wide array of superheroes and supervillains from the DC Comics universe .
