Costumes for Broadchurch were designed by freelance costume designer Ray Holman . Holman worked with the actors portraying major characters to ensure that the costumes fit the character . He spent hours discussing the characters with the actors , and sometimes took the actors shopping or to costume suppliers to find the right look . Holman crafted the `` old and saggy '' look of Alec Hardy 's character to reflect the fact that Hardy `` did n't really care what he wore . '' Often arriving on the set at 6 a.m. , Holman ensured that Tennant 's suit was appropriately crumpled every day . Holman also designed Ellie Miller 's `` unflattering grey work suit '' . Holman and actress Olivia Colman agreed that Ellie was a person who 'd lived in a small town her entire life . Having been a uniformed police officer , she 'd worked her way up in the ranks but still retained an unconscious desire to appear in uniform . The grey trouser suit was critical to that look . `` I did apologise to her about that , but it looked fantastic and characterised her , '' Holman said . Beth Lattimer 's red dress , seen in episode one , was also Holman 's idea . There was disagreement about it , but Holman said he insisted on the red dress . `` I wanted the red dress because I knew it would move quite beautifully and she has to run on the beach and I wanted the red against the cliffs , '' he said .
