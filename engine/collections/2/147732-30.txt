The various Protestant sects can not constitute one Church because they have no intercommunion ... each Protestant Church , whether Methodist or Baptist or whatever , is in perfect communion with itself everywhere as the Roman Catholic ; and in this respect , consequently , the Roman Catholic has no advantage or superiority , except in the point of numbers . As a further necessary consequence , it is plain that the Roman Church is no more Catholic in any sense than a Methodist or a Baptist .
