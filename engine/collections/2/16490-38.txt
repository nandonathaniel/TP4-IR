The matches were the second and third Grand Finals contested by the two clubs . The only previous encounter was the 1966 Grand Final in which St Kilda won its only premiership , winning by a single point 10.14 ( 74 ) to 10.13 ( 73 ) . They had met in a total of nine finals , of which St Kilda has won six , including the last five in a row , dating back to the 1966 Grand Final . Between them , Collingwood and St Kilda fielded only three players who had previously won a premiership : Darren Jolly ( Collingwood ) , Adam Schneider and Sean Dempster ( both St Kilda ) -- all three played in Sydney 's 2005 premiership team five years earlier .
