In Raqqa , the Syrian Army took control of the town of Al - Ejeil . ISIL reportedly sent reinforcements from Iraq to the governorate of Raqqa . The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said at least 400 ISIL fighters had also been wounded in the previous five days in clashes with the Syrian Army and National Defense Force in Raqqa alone . At the same time , several senior UK and US figures urged Turkey to stop allowing ISIL to cross the border to Syria and Iraq . It was around this time that the Americans realized that the Turks had no intention of sealing their side of the border , and so Washington decided to work with the Syrian Kurds to close off the border on the Syrian side . A year later , with the Kurds in control of most of the Turkey -- Syria border , and the Syrian army advancing under Russian air support to seal the remainder , the situation was causing great ructions in Ankara .
