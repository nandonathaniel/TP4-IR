First - season reviewers said the series had high production values , a fully realized world and compelling characters . According to Variety , `` There may be no show more profitable to its network than ' Game of Thrones ' is to HBO . Fully produced by the pay cabler and already a global phenomenon after only one season , the fantasy skein was a gamble that has paid off handsomely '' . The second season was also well received . Entertainment Weekly praised its `` vivid , vital , and just plain fun '' storytelling and , according to the Hollywood Reporter , the show made a `` strong case for being one of TV 's best series '' ; its seriousness made it the only drama comparable to Mad Men or Breaking Bad . The New York Times gave the series a mixed review , criticizing its number of characters , their lack of complexity and a meandering plot .
