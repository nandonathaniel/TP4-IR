Gum - digging was the major source of income for settlers in Northland , and farmers often worked the gumfields in the winter months to subsidise the poor income from their unbroken land . By the 1890s , 20,000 people were engaged in gum - digging , of which 7000 worked full - time . Gum - digging was not restricted to settlers or workers in the rural areas ; Auckland families would cross the WaitematƒÅ Harbour by ferry at weekends to dig in the fields around Birkenhead , causing damage to public roads and private farms , and leading to local council management of the problem .
