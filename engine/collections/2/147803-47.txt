Wundt considered that reference to the subject ( Subjektbezug ) , value assessment ( Wertbestimmung ) , the existence of purpose ( Zwecksetzung ) , and volitional acts ( Willenst√§tigkeit ) to be specific and fundamental categories for psychology . He frequently used the formulation `` the human as a motivated and thinking subject '' in order to characterise features held in common with the humanities and the categorical difference to the natural sciences .
