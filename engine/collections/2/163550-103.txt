Goddard was able to flight - test many of his rockets , but many resulted in what the uninitiated would call failures , usually resulting from engine malfunction or loss of control . Goddard did not consider them failures , however , because he felt that he always learned something from a test . Most of his work involved static tests , which are a standard procedure today , before a flight test .
