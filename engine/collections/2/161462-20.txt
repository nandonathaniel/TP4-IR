Conditions deteriorated rapidly in the Confederacy , as there was no new equipment and raids on both sides systematically destroyed key bridges , as well as locomotives and freight cars . Spare parts were cannibalized ; feeder lines were torn up to get replacement rails for trunk lines , and the heavy use of rolling stock wore them out . In 1864 - 65 the Confederate railroad network collapsed ; little traffic moved in 1865 .
