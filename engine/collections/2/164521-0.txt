The Law of Three Stages is an idea developed by Auguste Comte in his work The Course in Positive Philosophy . It states that society as a whole , and each particular science , develops through three mentally conceived stages : ( 1 ) the theological stage , ( 2 ) the metaphysical stage , and ( 3 ) the positive stage .
