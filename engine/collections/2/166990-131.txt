Cross-cultural communication is a field of study that looks at how people from different cultural backgrounds endeavor to communicate . All cultures make use of nonverbal communication but its meaning varies across cultures . In one particular country , a non-verbal sign may stand for one thing , and mean something else in another culture or country . The relation of cross-cultural communication with deviance is that a sign may be offensive to one in one culture and mean something completely appropriate in another . This is an important field of study because as educators , business employees , or any other form of career that consists of communicating with ones from other cultures , you need to understand non-verbal signs and their meanings , so you avoid offensive conversation or misleading conversation . Below is a list of non-verbal gestures that are appropriate in one country , and that would be considered deviant in another .
