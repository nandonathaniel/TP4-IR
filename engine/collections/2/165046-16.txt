Solar power also provides a significant share of electricity in the country . As of 2016 , more than 260,000 people worked in the solar industry and 43 states deployed net metering , where energy utilities bought back excess power generated by solar arrays . Large photovoltaic power plants in the United States include Solar Star ( 579 MW ) , near Rosamond , California , the Desert Sunlight Solar Farm , a 550 MW solar power plant in Riverside County , California and the Topaz Solar Farm , a 550 MW photovoltaic power plant , in San Luis Obispo County , California . Since the United States pioneered solar thermal power technology in the 1980s with Solar One , several more such power stations have been built . The largest of these solar thermal power stations are the Ivanpah Solar Power Facility ( 392 MW ) , southwest of Las Vegas , and the SEGS group of plants in the Mojave Desert , with a total generating capacity of 354 MW .
