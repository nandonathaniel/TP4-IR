Fructose , or fruit sugar , is a simple ketonic monosaccharide found in many plants , where it is often bonded to glucose to form the disaccharide sucrose . It is one of the three dietary monosaccharides , along with glucose and galactose , that are absorbed directly into blood during digestion . Fructose was discovered by French chemist Augustin - Pierre Dubrunfaut in 1847 . The name `` fructose '' was coined in 1857 by the English chemist William Allen Miller . Pure , dry fructose is a sweet , white , odorless , crystalline solid , and is the most water - soluble of all the sugars . Fructose is found in honey , tree and vine fruits , flowers , berries , and most root vegetables .
