There were two temples in Rome dedicated to Iuppiter Stator ; the first one was built and dedicated in 294 BC by Marcus Atilius Regulus after the third Samnite War . It was located on the Via Nova , below the Porta Mugonia , ancient entrance to the Palatine . Legend has attributed its founding to Romulus . There may have been an earlier shrine ( fanum ) , since the Jupiter 's cult is attested epigraphically . Ovid places the temple 's dedication on June 27 , but it is unclear whether this was the original date , or the rededication after the restoration by Augustus .
