Most historians assume that the two armies met where the rivers Clain and Vienne join between Tours and Poitiers . The number of troops in each army is not known . The Mozarabic Chronicle of 754 , a Latin contemporary source which describes the battle in greater detail than any other Latin or Arabic source , states that `` the people of Austrasia ( the Frankish forces ) , greater in number of soldiers and formidably armed , killed the king , Abd ar - Rahman '' , which agrees with many Arab and Muslim historians . However , virtually all Western sources disagree , and estimate the Franks at 30,000 , less than half the Muslim force .
