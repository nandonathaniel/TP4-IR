At the 2016 Victoria 's Secret Fashion Show , the brand was accused of `` cultural appropriation '' during the segment `` The Road Ahead '' that drew inspiration from Chinese culture . Kendall Jenner 's flame tail , Elsa Hosk 's dragon costume , and Adriana Lima 's embroidered thigh - high boots is what caused an uproar because many fans thought that it was inappropriate for women of other cultures to wear those items that meant so much to the Chinese culture . The reason behind Victoria 's Secret including this segment to the 2016 fashion show is because of their recent expansion into the Chinese market . They thought it would be a good way to appeal to the new Chinese customer . No apology or statement was released from the brand .
