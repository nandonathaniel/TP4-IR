Big Brother is a television reality game show based on an originally Dutch TV series of the same name created by producer John de Mol in 1997 . The series follows a diverse group of contestants , known as HouseGuests , who are living together in a custom - built home under constant surveillance . The HouseGuests are completely isolated from the outside world and can have no communication with those not in the house . The contestants are competing for a $500,000 grand prize , with weekly competitions and evictions determining who will win the show . The series takes its name from the character in George Orwell 's novel Nineteen Eighty - Four . The series launched on July 5 , 2000 to a successful start , though ratings and critical reaction continued to grow increasingly negative . This led to the second season being a revamp of the show , featuring a more competition - based challenge . The series has since continued to be a hit for CBS , and is the second longest - running adaptation of the series to date , after the Spanish adaptation .
