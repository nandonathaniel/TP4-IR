Sociocultural anthropology , which we understand to include linguistic anthropology , is concerned with the problem of difference and similarity within and between human populations . The discipline arose concomitantly with the expansion of European colonial empires , and its practices and theories have been questioned and reformulated along with processes of decolonization . Such issues have re-emerged as transnational processes have challenged the centrality of the nation - state to theorizations about culture and power . New challenges have emerged as public debates about multiculturalism , and the increasing use of the culture concept outside of the academy and among peoples studied by anthropology . These are not `` business - as - usual '' times in the academy , in anthropology , or in the world , if ever there were such times .
