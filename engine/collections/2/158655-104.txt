In the context of the Dutch - Portuguese War the company established its headquarters in Batavia , Java ( now Jakarta , Indonesia ) . Other colonial outposts were also established in the East Indies , such as on the Maluku Islands , which include the Banda Islands , where the VOC forcibly maintained a monopoly over nutmeg and mace . Methods used to maintain the monopoly involved extortion and the violent suppression of the native population , including mass murder . In addition , VOC representatives sometimes used the tactic of burning spice trees to force indigenous populations to grow other crops , thus artificially cutting the supply of spices like nutmeg and cloves .
