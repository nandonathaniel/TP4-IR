Kevin Stephen Johnson was born on 3 July 1942 , and grew up in Tungamull , which is between the Capricorn Coast and Rockhampton , Queensland . He is the only son of Richard Johnson ( timber contractor ) and Elinor Johnson ( post office , telephone exchange operator ) . Elinor was also a violinist and gave Johnson lessons but he showed little interest . He bought a guitar in his late teens and began his music career by singing in local beer gardens , then joining the Candymen on lead vocals and rhythm guitar . From the early 1960s he worked for the Queensland Department of Roads as a clerk ; playing and singing at night and writing songs in his spare time . Some of his songs came to the notice of rock and roll artist , Col Joye , who signed Johnson to his publishing company . In September 1966 Col Joye and the Joy Boys had a hit with `` Mary Anne '' , which had been written by Johnson .
