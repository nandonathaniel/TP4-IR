Following the ending of rifting in the Late Cretaceous to the early Cenozoic , the Big Bend area was subjected to the Laramide orogeny . This period of ( now east - west ) compression caused the northeast - facing Mesa de Anguila ( an uplifted monocline on the park 's southwest margin ) , the southwest - facing Sierra del Carmen -- Santiago Mountains ( an uplifted and thrust - faulted monocline that forms the park 's boundary on the east ) and the Tornillo Basin . During the middle Cenozoic , most of the volcanic rocks , including the Chisos group , the Pine Canyon caldera complex , and the Burro Mesa Formation , formed .
