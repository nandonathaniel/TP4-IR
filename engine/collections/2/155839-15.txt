Classes began at the School of International Affairs in September 1966 . The first director of the school was Norman Robertson , a distinguished public servant and diplomat . Prior to his appointment at the school , Robertson had served variously as Clerk of the Privy Council and Secretary to Cabinet , Canadian High Commissioner to the United Kingdom , and twice as the Under - secretary of External Affairs . Robertson did not enjoy teaching and was reportedly not an effective teacher . Enrolment at the School in the early years numbered over 30 .
