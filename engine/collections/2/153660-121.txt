Clarkson , Hammond and May launch their new programme with a film showing Clarkson leaving London to fly to Los Angeles where he meets Hammond and May . As the Hothouse Flowers play `` I Can See Clearly Now '' the trio drive Ford Mustangs through the California desert to Rabbit Dry Lake , accompanied by a range of cars and a fly - over by the Breitling Jet Team . Following a sequence where they greet the audience and viewers , and introduce the tent , the first feature shows the three presenters testing three hybrid hypercars ; with Clarkson in the McLaren P1 , Hammond in the Porsche 918 and May in the Ferrari LaFerrari at the Algarve International Circuit in Portugal . After a series of tests including a drag race ( which had no determined winner ) , a road drive and an electric race ( both of which the LaFerrari did not take part in ) , Jérôme d'Ambrosio performs timed laps in the hypercars . Hammond 's Porsche 918 sets the fastest time and both he May declare that they will demolish Clarkson 's house as forfeit for losing a bet : that the McLaren P1 would be fastest in a timed lap and beat the Porsche 918 and LaFerrari . Clarkson introduces the show 's new test track , the `` Eboladrome '' with laps by a Ferrari 488 and then tests a BMW M2 which is then sent round the track by the new test driver `` The American '' . May is revealed to have been caught speeding in a segment called `` Conversation Street '' . Jeremy Renner , Armie Hammer and Carol Vorderman are all humorously `` killed '' before being able to take part in the show in a segment called `` Celebrity Brain Crash '' .
