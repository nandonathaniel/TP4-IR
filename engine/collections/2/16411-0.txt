The 1744 cricket season was the 147th in England since the earliest known definite reference to cricket in January 1597 ( i.e. , Old Style -- 1598 New Style ) . Details have survived of 22 important eleven - a-side and three single wicket matches . It was a pivotal season in English cricket history because the earliest known codification of the Laws of Cricket was written by a group calling themselves the `` Noblemen and Gentlemen '' of the London Cricket Club .
