Anthony Winterbourne connects Huginn and Muninn to the Norse concepts of the fylgja -- a concept with three characteristics ; shape - shifting abilities , good fortune , and the guardian spirit -- and the hamingja -- the ghostly double of a person that may appear in the form of an animal . Winterbourne states that `` The shaman 's journey through the different parts of the cosmos is symbolized by the hamingja concept of the shape - shifting soul , and gains another symbolic dimension for the Norse soul in the account of OÃ°in 's ravens , Huginn and Muninn . '' In response to Simek 's criticism of attempts to interpret the ravens `` philosophically '' , Winterbourne says that `` such speculations ( ... ) simply strengthen the conceptual significance made plausible by other features of the mythology '' and that the names Huginn and Muninn `` demand more explanation than is usually provided .
