The geomagnetic field changes on time scales from milliseconds to millions of years . Shorter time scales mostly arise from currents in the ionosphere ( ionospheric dynamo region ) and magnetosphere , and some changes can be traced to geomagnetic storms or daily variations in currents . Changes over time scales of a year or more mostly reflect changes in the Earth 's interior , particularly the iron - rich core .
