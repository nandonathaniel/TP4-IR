In medieval cities , craftsmen tended to form associations based on their trades , confraternities of textile workers , masons , carpenters , carvers , glass workers , each of whom controlled secrets of traditionally imparted technology , the `` arts '' or `` mysteries '' of their crafts . Usually the founders were free independent master craftsmen who hired apprentices .
