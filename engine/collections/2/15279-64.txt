There are five basic religious acts in Islam , collectively known as ' The Pillars of Islam ' ( arkan al - Islam ; also arkan ad - din , `` pillars of religion '' ) , which are considered obligatory for all believers . The Quran presents them as a framework for worship and a sign of commitment to the faith . They are ( 1 ) the creed ( shahadah ) , ( 2 ) daily prayers ( salat ) , ( 3 ) almsgiving ( zakah ) , ( 4 ) fasting during Ramadan , and ( 5 ) the pilgrimage to Mecca ( hajj ) at least once in a lifetime . Both Shia and Sunni sects agree on the essential details for the performance of these acts . Apart from these , Muslims also perform other religious acts . Notable among them are charity ( Sadaqah ) and recitation of the Quran .
