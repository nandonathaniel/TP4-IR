A 2008 study by John Fregeau of 13 globular clusters in the Milky Way shows that three of them have an unusually large number of X-ray sources , or X-ray binaries , suggesting the clusters are middle - aged . Previously , these globular clusters had been classified as being in old age because they had very tight concentrations of stars in their centers , another test of age used by astronomers . The implication is that most globular clusters , including the other ten studied by Fregeau , are not in middle age as previously thought , but are actually in ' adolescence ' .
