In 1943 development efforts were directed to a plutonium gun - type fission weapon called `` Thin Man '' . Initial research on the properties of plutonium was done using cyclotron - generated plutonium - 239 , which was extremely pure but could only be created in tiny amounts . When Los Alamos received the first sample of plutonium from the X-10 Graphite Reactor in April 1944 a problem was discovered : reactor - bred plutonium had a higher concentration of plutonium - 240 , making it unsuitable for use in a gun - type weapon . In July 1944 , Oppenheimer abandoned the gun design in favor of an implosion - type weapon . Using chemical explosive lenses , a sub-critical sphere of fissile material could be squeezed into a smaller and denser form . The metal needed to travel only very short distances , so the critical mass would be assembled in much less time . In August 1944 Oppenheimer implemented a sweeping reorganization of the Los Alamos laboratory to focus on implosion . He concentrated the development efforts on the gun - type device , a simpler design that only had to work with uranium - 235 , in a single group , and this device became Little Boy in February 1945 . After a mammoth research effort , the more complex design of the implosion device , known as the `` Christy gadget '' after Robert Christy , another student of Oppenheimer 's , was finalized in a meeting in Oppenheimer 's office on February 28 , 1945 .
