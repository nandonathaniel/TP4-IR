Like other common colors , green has several completely opposite associations . While it is the color most associated by Europeans and Americans with good health , it is also the color most often associated with toxicity and poison . There was a solid foundation for this association ; in the nineteenth century several popular paints and pigments , notably verdigris , vert de Schweinfurt and vert de Paris , were highly toxic , containing copper or arsenic . The intoxicating drink absinthe was known as `` the green fairy '' .
