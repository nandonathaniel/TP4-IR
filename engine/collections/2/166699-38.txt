`` The End of the Film '' epilogue features the host of `` The Middle of the Film '' being handed an envelope containing the meaning of life . She reads it out : `` Try and be nice to people , avoid eating fat , read a good book every now and then , get some walking in , and try and live together in peace and harmony with people of all creeds and nations '' . She states that people want filth , explains that `` gratuitous pictures of penises and other meaningless controversies would do better at leading audiences to the cinema , and bitterly announces the closing credits .
