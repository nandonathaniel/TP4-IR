Peruggia may have been motivated by an associate whose copies of the original would significantly rise in value after the painting 's theft . A later account suggested Eduardo de Valfierno had been the mastermind of the theft and had commissioned forger Yves Chaudron to create six copies of the painting to sell in the U.S. while the location of the original was unclear . However , the original painting remained in Europe . After having kept the Mona Lisa in his apartment for two years , Peruggia grew impatient and was caught when he attempted to sell it to directors of the Uffizi Gallery in Florence . It was exhibited in the Uffizi Gallery for over two weeks and returned to the Louvre on 4 January 1914 . Peruggia served six months in prison for the crime and was hailed for his patriotism in Italy . Before its theft , the Mona Lisa was not widely known outside the art world . It was not until the 1860s that some critics , a thin slice of the French intelligentsia , began to hail it as a masterwork of Renaissance painting .
