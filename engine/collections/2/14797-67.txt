Most styles capitalise all words except for short closed - class words ( certain parts of speech , namely , articles , prepositions , and conjunctions ) ; but the first word ( always ) and last word ( in many styles ) are also capitalised , regardless of their part of speech . Many styles capitalise longer prepositions such as `` between '' and `` throughout '' , but not shorter ones such as `` for '' and `` with '' . Typically , a preposition is considered short if it has up to three or four letters . A few styles capitalise all words in title case ( the so - called start case ) , which has the advantage of being easy to implement and hard to get `` wrong '' ( that is , `` not edited to style '' ) . Because of this rule 's simplicity , software case - folding routines can handle 95 % or more of the editing , especially if they are programmed for desired exceptions ( such as `` FBI '' rather than `` Fbi '' ) . As for whether hyphenated words are capitalised not only at the beginning but also after the hyphen , there is no universal standard ; variation occurs in the wild and among house styles ( e.g. , `` The Letter - Case Rule in My Book '' ; `` Short - term Follow - up Care for Burns '' ) . Traditional copyediting makes a distinction between temporary compounds ( such as many nonce ( novel instance ) compound modifiers ) , in which every part of the hyphenated word is capitalised ( e.g. `` How This Particular Author Chose to Style His Autumn - Apple - Picking Heading '' ) , and permanent compounds , which are terms that , although compound and hyphenated , are so well established that dictionaries enter them as headwords ( e.g. , `` Short - term Follow - up Care for Burns '' ) .
