The Open Championship ( sometimes referred to as the British Open ) is organized by The R&A , an offshoot of The Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews , and is typically played on a links - style course in the United Kingdom ( primarily England or Scotland ) . It carries the prestige of being the oldest professional golf tournament currently in existence and the original `` Open '' championship ( although the very first event was held only for British professionals ) . It is respected for maintaining the tradition of links play that dates back to the very invention of the game in Scotland . Links courses are generally typified as coastal , flat and often very windswept , with the fairways cut through dune grass and gorse bushes that make up the `` rough '' , and have deep bunkers . The course is generally not `` doctored '' to make it more difficult , effectively making the variable weather the main external influence on the field 's score . As well as exempting from qualifying recent professional major and amateur champions , all former Open Championship winners under age 60 , and leading players from the world rankings , the R&A ensures that leading golfers from around the globe are given the chance to enter by holding qualifying events on all continents , as well as holding final qualifying events around the UK in the weeks prior to the main tournament . The champion receives ( and has his name inscribed on the base of ) the famous Claret Jug , a trophy that dates back to 1872 ( champions from 1860 until 1871 received instead a championship belt , much like a champion professional boxer 's belt nowadays ) and the engraving of the champions ' name on the trophy prior to them receiving it is , in itself , one of the traditions of the closing ceremony of the championship , as is the award of the silver medal to the leading amateur player to have made the cut to play the last 36 holes .
