( O ) nly 20 percent of the sample of 429 Southern soldiers explicitly voiced proslavery convictions in their letters or diaries . As one might expect , a much higher percentage of soldiers from slaveholding families than from nonslaveholding families expressed such a purpose : 33 percent , compared with 12 percent . Ironically , the proportion of Union soldiers who wrote about the slavery question was greater , as the next chapter will show . There is a ready explanation for this apparent paradox . Emancipation was a salient issue for Union soldiers because it was controversial . Slavery was less salient for most Confederate soldiers because it was not controversial . They took slavery for granted as one of the Southern ' rights ' and institutions for which they fought , and did not feel compelled to discuss it .
