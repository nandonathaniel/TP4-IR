The discovery of nuclear fission at the end of 1938 marked a shift in the centers of nuclear research from Europe to the United States . Large numbers of scientists were migrating to the United States to escape the troubles and antisemitism in Europe and the looming war ( See Jewish scientists and the Manhattan Project ) . The new centers of nuclear research were the universities in the United States , particularly Columbia University in New York and the University of Chicago where Enrico Fermi had relocated , and a secret research facility at Los Alamos , New Mexico , established in 1942 , the new home of the Manhattan project . This wartime project was focussed on the construction of nuclear weapons , exploiting the enormous energy released by the fission of uranium or plutonium through neutron - based chain reactions .
