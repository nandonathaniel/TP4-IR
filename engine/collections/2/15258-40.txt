Grant 's objective following Spotsylvania was the North Anna River , about 25 miles ( 40 km ) south . He sent Hancock 's Corps ahead of his army , hoping that Lee would attack it , luring him into the open . Lee did not take the bait and beat Grant to the North Anna . On May 23 , Warren 's V Corps crossed the river at Jericho Mills , fighting off an attack by A.P. Hill 's corps , while Hancock 's II Corps captured the bridge on the Telegraph Road . Lee then devised a plan , which represented a significant potential threat to Grant : a five - mile ( 8 km ) line that formed an inverted `` V '' shape with its apex on the river at Ox Ford , the only defensible crossing in the area . By moving south of the river , Lee hoped that Grant would assume that he was retreating , leaving only a token force to prevent a crossing at Ox Ford . If Grant pursued , the pointed wedge of the inverted V would split his army and Lee could concentrate on interior lines to defeat one wing ; the other Union wing would have to cross the North Anna twice to support the attacked wing .
