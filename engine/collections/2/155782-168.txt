In 1578 , the Portuguese published a Tamil book in old Tamil script named ' Thambiraan Vanakkam ' , thus making Tamil the first Indian language to be printed and published . Tamil Lexicon , published by the University of Madras , is the first among the dictionaries published in any Indian language . During the Indian freedom struggle , many Tamil poets and writers sought to provoke national spirit , social equity and secularist thoughts among the common man , notably Subramanya Bharathy and Bharathidasan .
