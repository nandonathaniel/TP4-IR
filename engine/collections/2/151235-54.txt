Gary Arnold , in The Washington Times , praised the cast : `` The film 's ace in the hole is the personal appeal generated by Mr. Freeman as the mature , cerebral cop and Mr. Pitt as the young , headstrong cop . Not that the contrast is inspired or believable in itself . What gets to you is the prowess of the co-stars as they fill out sketchy character profiles . '' Sheila Johnston , in her review for The Independent , praised Freeman 's performance : `` The film belongs to Freeman and his quiet , carefully detailed portrayal of the jaded older man who learns not to give up the fight . '' James Charisma , in a list of Spacey 's greatest film performances for Paste , wrote : `` Spacey 's portrayal is a perfect balancing act : John Doe is detached from the murders he commits , yet deliberate and meticulous in his execution ... Unemotional yet smug . Analytical , violent , patient , impenetrable . '' In his review for Sight and Sound , John Wrathall wrote , `` Seven has the scariest ending since George Sluizer 's original The Vanishing ... and stands as the most complex and disturbing entry in the serial killer genre since Manhunter . '' In his `` Great Movies '' list review , film critic Roger Ebert commented on Fincher 's direction : `` None of his films is darker than this one . ''
