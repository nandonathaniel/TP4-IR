The Spanish government official GDP growth forecast for 2008 in April was 2.3 % . This figure was successively revised down by the Spanish Ministry of Economy to 1.6 . Retrospective studies by most independent forecasters estimate that the rate had actually dropped to 0.8 % instead , far below the strong 3 % plus GDP annual growth rates during the 1997 -- 2007 decade . Then , during the third quarter of 2008 the national GDP contracted for the first time in 15 years and , in February 2009 , it was confirmed that Spain , along other European economies , had officially entered recession .
