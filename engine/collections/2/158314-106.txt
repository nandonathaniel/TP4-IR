In 1983 the metre was defined as `` the length of the path travelled by light in vacuum during a time interval of ​ ⁄ of a second '' , fixing the value of the speed of light at 7008299792458000000 ♠ 299 792 458 m / s by definition , as described below . Consequently , accurate measurements of the speed of light yield an accurate realization of the metre rather than an accurate value of c .
