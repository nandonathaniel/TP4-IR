Qin Shi Huang and Li Si unified China economically by standardizing the Chinese units of measurements such as weights and measures , the currency , and the length of the axles of carts to facilitate transport on the road system . The emperor also developed an extensive network of roads and canals connecting the provinces to improve trade between them . The currency of the different states were also standardized to the Ban liang coin ( 半 兩 , Bàn Liǎng ) . Perhaps most importantly , the Chinese script was unified . Under Li Si , the seal script of the state of Qin was standardized through removal of variant forms within the Qin script itself . This newly standardized script was then made official throughout all the conquered regions , thus doing away with all the regional scripts to form one language , one communication system for all of China .
