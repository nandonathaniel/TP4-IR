When the series debuted , it was slotted as counter programming opposite CBS ' popular Saturday night situation comedies , but failed to build an audience . The two - hour pilot movie ranked 58 out of 65 programs telecast that week , while the first regular episode of the series fared even lower at 62nd of 65 programs . In January 1973 , ABC shook up its lineup by shuffling a number of its programs around . The Streets of San Francisco moved to Thursday night , and immediately increased its viewership with an 18 rating and 31 % share of the audience . Over the next three years , the series flourished on Thursday , ranking # 22 for its second and third seasons and # 26 for its fourth . For the 1976 - 77 television season , ABC made the strategic error of moving The Streets of San Francisco up one hour , placing it in direct competition with Barnaby Jones , another Quinn Martin Production . The two crime dramas virtually split their audience with Barnaby Jones ranking 49th and The Streets of San Francisco falling to 52nd of 104 shows for the season . The decline in viewership , coupled with steadily rising production costs and a new contract for star Karl Malden , prompted ABC to cancel the series .
