Murch took a decidedly darker take on Baum 's source material than the 1939 adaptation , which he knew starting out would be a gamble . Between the development period and actual shooting , there was a change of leadership at the Walt Disney studios ( with Wilhite being replaced by Richard Berger ) , and the movie 's budget increased . Once shooting began , Murch began to fall behind schedule , and there was further pressure from the studio , leading to Murch being fired as director for a short period . George Lucas and other high - profile filmmakers including Francis Ford Coppola supported Murch in discussions with the studio , and Murch was reinstated and finished the film .
