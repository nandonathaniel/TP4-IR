The Nomocanon of Saint Sava ( Serbian : Законоправило / Zakonopravilo ) was the first Serbian constitution from 1219 . This legal act was well developed . St. Sava 's Nomocanon was the compilation of Civil law , based on Roman Law and Canon law , based on Ecumenical Councils and its basic purpose was to organize functioning of the young Serbian kingdom and the Serbian church . Saint Sava began the work on the Serbian Nomocanon in 1208 while being at Mount Athos , using The Nomocanon in Fourteen Titles , Synopsis of Stefan the Efesian , Nomocanon of John Scholasticus , Ecumenical Councils ' documents , which he modified with the canonical commentaries of Aristinos and Joannes Zonaras , local church meetings , rules of the Holy Fathers , the law of Moses , translation of Prohiron and the Byzantine emperors ' Novellae ( most were taken from Justinian 's Novellae ) . The Nomocanon was completely new compilation of civil and canonical regulations , taken from the Byzantine sources , but completed and reformed by St. Sava to function properly in Serbia . Beside decrees that organized the life of church , there are various norms regarding civil life , most of them were taken from Prohiron . Legal transplants of Roman - Byzantine law became the basis of the Serbian medieval law . The essence of Zakonopravilo was based on Corpus Iuris Civilis .
