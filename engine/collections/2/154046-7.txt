In some jurisdictions the prosecuting authority may directly present a defendant for trial regardless of the result of the committal proceedings by filing an ex officio indictment . Equally , the prosecuting authority usually has the power to stop any prosecution by entering a nolle prosequi . In many jurisdictions the right of a defendant to cross-examine witnesses during the committal is reliant on the defence establishing that it is in the interests of justice or to illuminate some relevant point . The defence very rarely calls witnesses at a committal .
