In 1762 , during the Seven Years ' War , France ceded the Louisiana territory to Spain . This left Britain and Spain competing for dominance along the Mississippi ; by 1773 , the British were trading with the native peoples of Nebraska . In response , Spain dispatched two trading expeditions up the Missouri in 1794 and 1795 ; the second , under James Mackay , established the first European settlement in Nebraska near the mouth of the Platte . Later that year , Mackay 's party built a trading post , dubbed Fort Carlos IV ( Fort Charles ) , near present - day Homer .
