In May 2011 Kelley Blue Book ( KBB ) projected the 2011 Chevrolet Volt resale value at just over US $17,000 after 36 months , the length of a typical lease , which represents 42 % of the car 's US $41,000 suggested retail price ( MSRP ) . KBB explains that even though the residual value seems low , the projection considers that the first 200,000 Volts sold will qualify for a US $7,500 federal tax credit , which effectively reduces the MSRP to US $33,500 , making the US $17,000 represent 51 % of its original value after the tax credit . In comparison , KBB notes , the 2011 Toyota Prius has a projected residual of 46 % after 36 months . KBB 's estimate assumed gasoline price will be around US $4 per gallon in 2014 . For 2012 , Kelley Blue Book expected the Volt to retain 42 % of its original value after 3 years and 27 % after 5 years . Based on these figures , in November 2011 KBB awarded the Volt with the 2012 Best Resale Value Awards in the plug - in electric car category . KBB explains that the residual value for the Volt is lower than the market 35.5 % average due to the US $7,500 federal tax credit , which lowers the transaction price and pushes down the residual value .
