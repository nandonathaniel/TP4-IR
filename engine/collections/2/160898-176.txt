The unified Jewish resistance movement broke up in July 1946 , after Etzel bombed the British Military Headquarters in the King David Hotel killing 91 people . In the days following the bombing , Tel Aviv was placed under curfew and over 120,000 Jews , nearly 20 % of the Jewish population of Palestine , were questioned by the police . In the US , Congress criticized British handling of the situation and delayed loans that were vital to British post-war recovery . By 1947 the Labour Government was ready to refer the Palestine problem to the newly created United Nations .
