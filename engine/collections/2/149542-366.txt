Whilst residents of the Cayman Islands , as British Overseas Territories Citizens , are eligible automatically to register as a full British citizen under Section 4 ( A ) of the British Overseas Territories Act 2002 , thereby able additionally to enter the United States under the Visa Waiver Program , they can alternatively enter visa - free using their Cayman Islands passports . To qualify under the latter method , their Cayman Islands passports must confirm their British Overseas Territories citizenship and be endorsed by the Cayman Islands Passport and Corporate Services Office with a Cayman - U.S. visa waiver , issued at a cost of $15 -- 25 and valid for one entry . They must travel directly between the Cayman Islands and the United States and their Cayman Islands passport must also have a validity of at least six months beyond their intended departure date from the United States . If Cayman Islanders elect to enter the U.S. using the Cayman - U.S. visa waiver , they are not required to apply for an ESTA online , since they are not entering under the VWP .
