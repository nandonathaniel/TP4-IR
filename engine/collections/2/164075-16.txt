In reality , neither the US Army nor US Navy was in shape for war in terms of manpower , size , military hardware or experience . The Navy had fine ships but Wilson had been using them to threaten Mexico , and the fleet 's readiness had suffered . The crews of the Texas and the New York , the two newest and largest battleships , had never fired a gun , and the morale of the sailors was low . The Army and Navy air forces were tiny in size . Despite the flood of new weapons systems unveiled in the war in Europe , the Army was paying scant attention . For example , it was making no studies of trench warfare , poison gas or tanks , and was unfamiliar with the rapid evolution of Aerial warfare . The Democrats in Congress tried to cut the military budget in 1915 . The Preparedness movement effectively exploited the surge of outrage over the `` Lusitania '' in May 1915 , forcing the Democrats to promise some improvements to the military and naval forces . Wilson , less fearful of the Navy , embraced a long - term building program designed to make the fleet the equal of the British Royal Navy by the mid-1920s , although this would not come to pass until after World War II . `` Realism '' was at work here ; the admirals were Mahanians and they therefore wanted a surface fleet of heavy battleships second to none -- that is , equal to Great Britain . The facts of submarine warfare ( which necessitated destroyers , not battleships ) and the possibilities of imminent war with Germany ( or with Britain , for that matter ) , were simply ignored .
