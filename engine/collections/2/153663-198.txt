The most intense storm on record was Typhoon Tip in the northwestern Pacific Ocean in 1979 , which reached a minimum pressure of 870 hectopascals ( 25.69 inHg ) and maximum sustained wind speeds of 165 knots ( 85 m / s ) or 190 miles per hour ( 310 km / h ) . The highest maximum sustained wind speed ever recorded was 185 knots ( 95 m / s ) or 215 miles per hour ( 345 km / h ) in Hurricane Patricia in 2015 , which is the most intense cyclone ever recorded in the Western Hemisphere . Typhoon Nancy in 1961 also had recorded wind speeds of 185 knots ( 95 m / s ) or 215 miles per hour ( 346 km / h ) , but recent research indicates that wind speeds from the 1940s to the 1960s were gauged too high , and this is no longer considered the storm with the highest wind speeds on record . Likewise , a surface - level gust caused by Typhoon Paka on Guam in late 1997 was recorded at 205 knots ( 105 m / s ) or 235 miles per hour ( 378 km / h ) . Had it been confirmed , it would be the strongest non-tornadic wind ever recorded on the Earth 's surface , but the reading had to be discarded since the anemometer was damaged by the storm . The World Meteorological Organization established Barrow Island as the location of the highest non-tornado related wind gust at 408 km / h ( 253 mph ) . The gust occurred on April 10 , 1996 , during Severe Tropical Cyclone Olivia and is documented in the Australian Meteorological and Oceanographic Journal . In addition to being the most intense tropical cyclone on record based on pressure , Tip was the largest cyclone on record , with tropical storm - force winds 2,170 kilometres ( 1,350 mi ) in diameter . The smallest storm on record , Tropical Storm Marco , formed during October 2008 , and made landfall in Veracruz . Marco generated tropical storm - force winds only 37 kilometres ( 23 mi ) in diameter .
