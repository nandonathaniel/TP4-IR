The Balkan Wars were two wars that took place in the Balkans in 1912 and 1913 . Four Balkan states defeated the Ottoman Empire in the first war ; one of the four , Bulgaria , was defeated in the second war . The Ottoman Empire lost nearly all of its holdings in Europe . Austria - Hungary , although not a combatant , was weakened as a much enlarged Serbia pushed for union of the South Slavic peoples . The war set the stage for the Balkan crisis of 1914 and thus was a `` prelude to the First World War . ''
