The film was parodied in the 1993 Simpsons episode `` Cape Feare '' , with Sideshow Bob in the role of Cady . They also pay homage to another Robert Mitchum film The Night of the Hunter in which Sideshow Bob 's knuckles ( scaled down for a cartoon character with one fewer finger on each hand ) say `` Luv '' ( Love ) and `` HƒÅt '' ( Hate , with the diacritical mark providing the long vowel ) .
