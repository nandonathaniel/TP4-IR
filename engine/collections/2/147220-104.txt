The Netherlands has also had a recent debate that has reached the level of the Prime Minister proposing a cousin marriage ban . The proposed policy is explicitly aimed at preventing `` import marriages '' from certain nations like Morocco with a high rate of cousin marriage . Critics argue that such a ban would contradict Section 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights , is not based on science , and would affect more than immigrants . While some proponents argue such marriages were banned until 1970 , according to Frans van Poppel of the Netherlands Interdisciplinary Demographic Institute , they are confusing cousin marriage with uncle - niece marriage .
