The initial technologies of the Industrial Revolution , such as mechanized textiles , iron and coal , did little , if anything , to lower food prices . In Britain and the Netherlands , food supply increased before the Industrial Revolution due to better agricultural practices ; however , population grew too , as noted by Thomas Malthus . This condition is called the Malthusian trap , and it finally started to overcome by transportation improvements , such as canals , improved roads and steamships . Railroads and steamships were introduced near the end of the Industrial Revolution .
