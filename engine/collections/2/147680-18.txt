Scoobert `` Scooby '' Doo is the eponymous character and protagonist of the animated television franchise of the same name created in 1969 by the American animation company Hanna - Barbera . Scooby - Doo is a male Great Dane and lifelong companion of amateur detective Shaggy Rogers , with whom he shares many personality traits . Named after a nonsense vocal line in Frank Sinatra 's hit song `` Strangers in the Night '' , he features a mix of both canine and human behaviors ( reminiscent of other funny animals in the Golden age of American animation ) , treated by his friends more or less as an equal while speaking in a famous ( and much parodied ) speech impediment . His catchphrase is `` Scooby - Dooby - Doo ! ''
