However , with the oil shock of 1973 , and the economic problems of the 1970s , Keynesian economics began to fall out of favour . During this time , many economies experienced high and rising unemployment , coupled with high and rising inflation , contradicting the Phillips curve 's prediction . This stagflation meant that the simultaneous application of expansionary ( anti-recession ) and contractionary ( anti-inflation ) policies appeared to be necessary . This dilemma led to the end of the Keynesian near - consensus of the 1960s , and the rise throughout the 1970s of ideas based upon more classical analysis , including monetarism , supply - side economics , and new classical economics .
