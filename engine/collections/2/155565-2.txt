Google 's machine translation is a useful starting point for translations , but translators must revise errors as necessary and confirm that the translation is accurate , rather than simply copy - pasting machine - translated text into the English Wikipedia . Do not translate text that appears unreliable or low - quality . If possible , verify the text with references provided in the foreign - language article . You must provide copyright attribution in the edit summary by providing an interlanguage link to the source of your translation .
