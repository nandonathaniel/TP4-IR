Research into military use of long range rockets began when the studies of graduate student Wernher von Braun attracted the attention of the German Army . A series of prototypes culminated in the A-4 , which went to war as the V - 2 . Beginning in September 1944 , over 3,000 V - 2s were launched by the German Wehrmacht against Allied targets , first London and later Antwerp and Li√®ge . According to a 2011 BBC documentary , the attacks from V2s resulted in the deaths of an estimated 9,000 civilians and military personnel , and a further 12,000 forced laborers and concentration camp prisoners died as a result of their forced participation in the production of the weapons .
