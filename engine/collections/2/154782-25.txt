With the support of Governor George Washington Steele , on December 18 , 1890 the Oklahoma Territorial legislature established three universities : the state university in Norman , the agricultural and mechanical college in Stillwater ( later renamed Oklahoma State University ) and a normal school in Edmond ( later renamed University of Central Oklahoma ) . Oklahoma 's admission into the union in 1907 led to the renaming of the Norman Territorial University as the University of Oklahoma . Norman residents donated 407 acres ( 1.6 km ) of land for the university 0.5 miles ( 0.8 km ) south of the Norman railroad depot . The university 's first president ordered the planting of trees before the construction of the first campus building because he `` could not visualize a treeless university seat . '' Landscaping remains important to the university .
