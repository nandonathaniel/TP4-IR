Today the archaeological remnants of this once opulent city are about 70 kilometers northeast of the modern Iranian city of Shiraz , in the Pars province , in southwestern Iran . Persepolis is a wide , elevated complex 40 feet high , 100 feet wide , and a third of a mile long , composed of multiple halls , corridors , a wide terrace , and a special , double , symmetrical stairway that would provide access to the top of the terrace . The stairway would delineate relief scenes of various motifs of daily life or nature , including some that were literal as well as metaphorical ; Some scenes would show natural acts such as a lion attacking its prey but bear symbolism of spring and the Nowruz festival . Other scenes would depict , subjects from all states of the empire presenting gifts to the king , as well as scenes depicting royal guards , or scenes of social interactions between the guards or the dignitaries . This stairway is sometimes referred to as `` All countries . ''
