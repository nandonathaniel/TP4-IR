The war has been called the first `` world war '' , because fighting took place on several different continents . In 1759 the British enjoyed victories over the French in Europe , Canada and India , severely weakening the French position around the world . In 1762 the British captured the cities of Manila and Havana from Spain , France 's strongest ally , which led ultimately to a peace settlement the following year that saw a large number of territories come under British control .
