Debra Jo Rupp as Kitty Forman : Red 's wife and mother of Eric and Laurie , and Hyde 's informally adoptive mother , Kitty is a cheerful , doting mother , but can also be assertive when pushed . A nurse by profession , she drinks heavily and is a former smoker . Her major mood swings are usually attributed to menopause , although the lack of affection and attention from her daughter ( Laurie ) and her mother ( Bea ) is also partly to blame . She is also a nurturing mother figure to Eric 's rather dysfunctional friends , especially Fez .
