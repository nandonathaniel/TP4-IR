There is more downward turning of the flow than there would be in a two - dimensional flow with the same airfoil shape and sectional lift , and a higher sectional angle of attack is required to achieve the same lift compared to a two - dimensional flow . The wing is effectively flying in a downdraft of its own making , as if the freestream flow were tilted downward , with the result that the total aerodynamic force vector is tilted backward slightly compared to what it would be in two dimensions . The additional backward component of the force vector is called lift - induced drag .
