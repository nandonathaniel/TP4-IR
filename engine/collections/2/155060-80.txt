William was also stadtholder of the main provinces of the Dutch Republic , then in the preliminary stages of joining the War of the Grand Alliance against France , in a context of international tensions caused by the revocation by Louis XIV of the Edict of Nantes and the disputed succession of Cologne and the Electorate of the Palatinate . William had already acquired the reputation of being the main champion in Europe of the Protestant cause against Catholicism and French absolutism ; in the developing English crisis he saw an opportunity to prevent an Anglo - French alliance and bring England to the anti-French side , by carrying out a military intervention directed against James . This suited the desires of several English politicians who intended to depose James . It is still a matter of debate whether the initiative for the conspiracy was taken by the English or by the stadtholder and his wife . William had been trying to influence English politics for well over a year , letting Grand Pensionary Gaspar Fagel publish an open letter to the English people in November 1687 deploring the religious policy of James , which action had generally been interpreted as a covert bid for kingship .
