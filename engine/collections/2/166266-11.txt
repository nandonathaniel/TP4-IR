As of 2012 , there are 118 known elements , about 80 of which are stable -- that is , they do not change by radioactive decay into other elements . Some elements can occur as more than a single chemical substance ( allotropes ) . For instance , oxygen exists as both diatomic oxygen ( O ) and ozone ( O ) . The majority of elements are classified as metals . These are elements with a characteristic lustre such as iron , copper , and gold . Metals typically conduct electricity and heat well , and they are malleable and ductile . Around a dozen elements , such as carbon , nitrogen , and oxygen , are classified as non-metals . Non-metals lack the metallic properties described above , they also have a high electronegativity and a tendency to form negative ions . Certain elements such as silicon sometimes resemble metals and sometimes resemble non-metals , and are known as metalloids .
