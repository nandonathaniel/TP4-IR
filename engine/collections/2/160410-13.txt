A stupa is a building created specifically for the relics . Many Buddhist temples have stupas and historically , the placement of relics in a stupa often became the initial structure around which the whole temple would be based . Today , many stupas also hold the ashes or ringsel of prominent / respected Buddhists who were cremated . In rare cases the whole body is conserved , for example in the case of Dudjom Rinpoche , after his death his physical body was moved a year later from France and placed in a stupa in one of his main monasteries near Boudhanath , Nepal in 1988 . Pilgrims may view his body through a glass window in the stupa .
