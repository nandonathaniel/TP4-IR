In the 1960s , with Diana Vreeland as editor - in - chief and personality , the magazine began to appeal to the youth of the sexual revolution by focusing more on contemporary fashion and editorial features that openly discussed sexuality . Toward this end , Vogue extended coverage to include East Village boutiques such as Limbo on St. Mark 's Place , as well as including features of `` downtown '' personalities such as Andy Warhol 's `` Superstar '' Jane Holzer 's favorite haunts . Vogue also continued making household names out of models , a practice that continued with Suzy Parker , Twiggy , Jean Shrimpton , Lauren Hutton , Veruschka , Marisa Berenson , Penelope Tree , and others .
