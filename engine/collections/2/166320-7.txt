In October 1849 the southern interests held a convention to discuss railroads in Memphis , in response to a convention in St. Louis earlier that fall which discussed a northern route . The Memphis convention overwhelmingly advocated the construction of a route beginning there , to connect with an El Paso , Texas to San Diego , California line . Disagreement arose only over the issue of financing . The convention president , Matthew Fontaine Maury of Virginia , preferred strict private financing , whereas John Bell and others thought that federal land grants to railroad developers would be necessary .
