Scarface provoked outrage mainly because of its unprecedented violence , but also for its shifts of tone from serious to comedic . Dave Kehr , writing in the Chicago Reader , stated that the film blends `` comedy and horror in a manner that suggests Chico Marx let loose with a live machine gun . '' In one scene , Camonte is inside a cafe while a torrent of machine - gun fire from the car of a rival gang is headed his way ; when the barrage is over , Camonte picks up one of the newly released tommy guns the gangsters dropped and exhibits childlike wonder and unrestrained excitement over the new toy . Civic leaders became furious that gangsters like Capone ( who was also the inspiration for Little Caesar ) were being applauded in movie houses all across America . The screenplay , adapted by Ben Hecht who was a journalist in Chicago , contained biographical details for Muni 's character in Scarface that were so obviously taken from Capone , and the detail so close , that it was impossible not to draw the parallels .
