There are also recurring timbral choices in the scores : In `` Rock and Pool '' , Shore uses the sound of the Cimbalom , on its own , to evoke Gollum 's thematic material without quoting it . Bowed cymbals are often used to create a sense of unease in the quest 's darker passages such as the journey 's in the dark , the Dead Marshes and the shadow World . Aleatoric devices are used similarly , as well . There are also distinct timbral variations on themes : The Shire theme also has a more spy variation for tin whistle , and even when it is played on a clarinet it is usually done to evoke Bilbo . Even lyrics are used narratively : before the seduction of the ring theme can appear , Shore introduces the associated lyric with a rising male choir , without the melody , to portray Isildur 's seduction by the ring . When Frodo and Sam approach Minas Morgul , the choir sings syllables from `` The Revelation of the Ringwraiths '' , associated with the ringwraith theme , without quoting the theme , per se .
