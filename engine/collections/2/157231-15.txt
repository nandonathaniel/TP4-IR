A joint session of the United States Congress is a gathering of members of the two chambers of the bicameral legislature of the federal government of the United States : the Senate and the House of Representatives . Joint sessions can be held on any special occasion , but are required to be held when the President delivers a State of the Union address , when they gather to count and certify the votes of the Electoral College following a presidential election , or when they convene on the occasion of a presidential inauguration . A joint session is a ceremonial or formal occasion and does not perform any legislative function ; and no resolution is proposed or vote taken .
