There is mounting evidence that at least some massive protostars are indeed surrounded by accretion disks . Several other theories of massive star formation remain to be tested observationally . Of these , perhaps the most prominent is the theory of competitive accretion , which suggests that massive protostars are `` seeded '' by low - mass protostars which compete with other protostars to draw in matter from the entire parent molecular cloud , instead of simply from a small local region .
