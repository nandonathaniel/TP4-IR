Mammoth Mountain also lies on the south end of the Mono - Inyo chain of volcanic craters . The magma source for Mammoth Mountain is distinct from those of both the Long Valley Caldera and the Inyo Craters . Mammoth Mountain is composed primarily of dacite and rhyolite , part of which has been altered by hydrothermal activity from fumaroles ( steam vents ) .
