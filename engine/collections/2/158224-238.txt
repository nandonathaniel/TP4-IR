The attacks by the Sixth Panzer Army 's infantry units in the north fared badly because of unexpectedly fierce resistance by the U.S. 2nd and 99th Infantry Divisions . Kampfgruppe Peiper , at the head of the Sepp Dietrich 's Sixth Panzer Army , had been designated to take the Losheim - Losheimergraben road , a key route through the Losheim Gap , but it was closed by two collapsed overpasses that German engineers failed to repair during the first day . Peiper 's forces were rerouted through Lanzerath .
