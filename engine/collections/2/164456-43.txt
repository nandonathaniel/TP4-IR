Shooting occurred over three weeks , beginning at Valencia Studios , where Terminator 2 : Judgment Day had recently finished production . Several violent scenes were filmed at Big Sky Ranch , where Little House on the Prairie and The Waltons were shot . Davis later said it felt `` a little blasphemous '' . Davis performed most of his own stunts . For the scene where Davis chases Aniston in a wheelchair , Aniston had to run in slow motion so that Davis could keep up with her , as he had trouble manipulating the wheels . The film was initially more of a straightforward horror film , but Davis sought to add more comedic elements . Jones agreed with this tonal shift , and they shot it as a horror comedy . Several scenes had to be re-shot after the producers insisted that the film be made gorier to appeal to older audiences .
