The two stores Nord and Süd have distinct logos with Nord displaying the entire ' A ' for ALDI while Süd unveiled a logo in 1982 which displays only half . In 2006 , Aldi Süd modified the logo slightly and then in March 2017 , unveiled a new logo which removed the blue box line around the artistic ' A ' and revealed a more rounded , 3D look for the logo as well as a new font for the word ' ALDI ' , further differentiating it from the Aldi Nord logo which had shared the same font for the brand until then .
