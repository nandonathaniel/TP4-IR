The 1951 season opened up at Yankee Stadium . The Yankees defeated the Red Sox , which was PA announcer Bob Sheppard first game . Sheppard would go on to serve PA duties at Yankee Stadium for another 56 years . On September 28 of that year , Yankees pitcher Allie Reynolds pitched a no - hitter against the Red Sox . A year later , Red Sox outfielder Jimmy Piersall and Yankees second baseman Billy Martin exchanged insults before a game in Boston , and ended up fighting in the tunnel under the stands . The fight was eventually broken up by Yankees coaches Bill Dickey and Oscar Melillo , and Boston starting pitcher Ellis Kinder . Piersall changed out of his bloody shirt and promptly fought with teammate Maury McDermott . The Red Sox won 5 -- 2 with Piersall sitting the game out .
