Armigers bearing moors or moors ' heads may have adopted them for any of several reasons , to include symbolizing military victories in the Crusades , as a pun on the bearer 's name in the canting arms of Morese , Negri , Saraceni , etc. , or in the case of Frederick II , possibly to demonstrate the reach of his empire . The arms of Pope Benedict XVI feature a moor 's head , crowned and collared red , in reference to the arms of Freising , Germany . In the case of Corsica and Sardinia , the blindfolded moors ' heads in the four quarters have long been said to represent the four Moorish emirs who were defeated by Peter I of Aragon in the 11th century , the four moors ' heads around a cross having been adopted to the arms of Aragon around 1281 -- 1387 , and Corsica and Sardinia having come under the dominion of the king of Aragon in 1297 . In Corsica , the blindfolds were lifted to the brow in the 18th century as a way of expressing the island 's newfound independence .
