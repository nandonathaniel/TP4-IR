The mouth of the stingray is located on the ventral side of the vertebrate . Stringrays exhibit euhyostyly jaw suspension , which means that the mandibular arch is only suspended by an articulation with the hyomandibula . This type of suspensions allows for the upper jaw to have high mobility and protrude outward . The teeth are modified placoid scale s that are regularly shedded and replaced . In general , the teeth have a root implanted within the connective tissue and a visible portion of the tooth , is large and flat , allowing them to crush the bodies of hard shelled prey . Male stingrays display sexual dimorphism by developing cusp , or pointed ends , to some of their teeth . During mating season , some stingray species fully change their tooth morphology which then returns to baseline during non-mating seasons .
