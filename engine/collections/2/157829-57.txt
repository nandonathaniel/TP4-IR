The vast majority of IKEA stores are located outside of city centers , primarily because of land cost and traffic access . Several smaller store formats have been unsuccessfully tested in the past ( the `` midi '' concept in the early ' 90s , which was tested in Ottawa and Heerlen with 9,300 m ( 100,000 sq ft ) , or a `` boutique '' shop in Manhattan ) . A new format for a full - size , city centre store was introduced with the opening of the Manchester ( United Kingdom ) store , situated in Ashton - Under - Lyne in 2006 . Another store , in Coventry opened in December 2007 . The store has seven floors and a different flow from other IKEA stores . IKEA 's Southampton store which opened in February 2009 is also in the city centre and built in an urban style similar to the Coventry store . IKEA built these stores in response to UK government restrictions blocking retail establishment outside city centres .
