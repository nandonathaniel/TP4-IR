In the late 16th century , as the Renaissance era closed , an extremely manneristic style developed . In secular music , especially in the madrigal , there was a trend towards complexity and even extreme chromaticism ( as exemplified in madrigals of Luzzaschi , Marenzio , and Gesualdo ) . The term `` mannerism '' derives from art history .
