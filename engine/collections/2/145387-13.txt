Again , unlike the effect that low - gravity environments have on weight , buoyancy does not make a portion of an object 's weight vanish ; the missing weight is instead being borne by the ground , which leaves less force ( weight ) being applied to any scale theoretically placed underneath the object in question ( though one may perhaps have some trouble with the practical aspects of accurately weighing something individually in that condition ) . If one were however to weigh a small wading pool that someone then entered and began floating in , they would find that the full weight of the person was being borne by the pool and , ultimately , the scale underneath the pool . Whereas a buoyant object ( on a properly working scale for weighing buoyant objects ) would weigh less , the object / fluid system becomes heavier by the value of object 's full mass once the object is added . Since air is a fluid , this principle applies to object / air systems as well ; large volumes of air -- and ultimately the ground -- supports the weight a body loses through mid-air buoyancy .
