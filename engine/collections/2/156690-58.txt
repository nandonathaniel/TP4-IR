PAN truncation : in which only some of the digits on a card are displayed or printed on receipts . The PCI DSS standard dictates that only the first six and last four digits of the PAN may be printed on a receipt or displayed in cases other than where a business need requires the full PAN . US federal law ( FACTA ) allows only the display of the last 5 digits . In order to comply with both PCI DSS requirements and US federal law , generally only the last four digits are provided elsewhere to allow an individual to identify the card used .
