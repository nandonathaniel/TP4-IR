Biopolymer -- polymers produced by living organisms ; in other words , they are polymeric biomolecules . Since they are polymers , biopolymers contain monomeric units that are covalently bonded to form larger structures . There are three main classes of biopolymers , classified according to the monomeric units used and the structure of the biopolymer formed : polynucleotides ( RNA and DNA ) , which are long polymers composed of 13 or more nucleotide monomers ; polypeptides , which are short polymers of amino acids ; and polysaccharides , which are often linear bonded polymeric carbohydrate structures .
