The U.S. incarceration rate peaked in 2008 when about 1 in 100 US adults was behind bars . This incarceration rate exceeded the average incarceration levels in the Soviet Union during the existence of the Gulag system , when the Soviet Union 's population reached 168 million , and 1.2 to 1.5 million people were in the Gulag prison camps and colonies ( i.e. about 0.8 imprisoned per 100 USSR residents , according to numbers from Anne Applebaum and Steven Rosefielde ) . The Soviet Union 's incarceration rates from 1934 to 1953 were historically the world 's highest for a modern age country , according to The Gulag Archipelago book ( 1973 ) by Nobel Prize winner Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn . In The New Yorker article The Caging of America ( 2012 ) , Adam Gopnik writes : `` Over all , there are now more people under ' correctional supervision ' in America -- more than six million -- than were in the Gulag Archipelago under Stalin at its height .
