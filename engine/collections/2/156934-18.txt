The use of the common names `` frog '' and `` toad '' has no taxonomic justification . From a classification perspective , all members of the order Anura are frogs , but only members of the family Bufonidae are considered `` true toads '' . The use of the term `` frog '' in common names usually refers to species that are aquatic or semi-aquatic and have smooth , moist skins ; the term `` toad '' generally refers to species that are terrestrial with dry , warty skins . There are numerous exceptions to this rule . The European fire - bellied toad ( Bombina bombina ) has a slightly warty skin and prefers a watery habitat whereas the Panamanian golden frog ( Atelopus zeteki ) is in the toad family Bufonidae and has a smooth skin .
