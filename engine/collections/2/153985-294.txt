Miles wants to direct a student film and has enlisted Sabrina 's help . As producer and playing the part of Cheerleader # 2 , she is involved in casting the other roles in the vampire horror film . Hilda and Zelda want parts in Miles ' film until they get a notice for `` scare duty '' - the Other Realm 's version of jury duty . Every few hundred years they must teach a class on how to be scary . If they can get the students to learn everything in one session , they do n't have to teach scare class ever again . Sabrina and Miles ca n't find the perfect vampire for the film , so Sabrina puts out an ad . Vladimir Kortensky ( played by guest star Sisq√≥ ) shows up and is perfect for the part - too perfect . Sabrina gets suspicious and logs on to the Witch Wide Web , finding out that Vladimir is a real vampire , and despite his acting resume , is after her friends ' blood ! Sabrina corners Vlad and fights him , Matrix - inspired moves and all . She finally manages to stake him ( with a steak ) . Meanwhile the aunts are n't being very scary in the Other Realm . After the students pelt them with spitwads , they get so angry they turn into genuinely scary monsters - frightening the class and gaining freedom from scare duty . They show up to Sabrina 's movie set in time for Hilda to step in as Vlad .
