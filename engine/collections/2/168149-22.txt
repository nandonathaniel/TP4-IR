Harley gave Layfon a separate DITE before he went to go fight the matured Pollutant Beast alone . This heavier , black blade , called Adamandite , was made to handle Layfon 's kei better by combining several DITEs together and is able to create blasts of air with just a swing , humorously causing Felli 's hair to become messy when Layfon first tries it out . It is restored with the phrase , `` Restoration A-D '' and also retains the first two settings of his older DITE . Adamandite has only been used with stronger Pollutant Beasts so far . ( He faced Haia with the simple adamandite ) . Layfon has broken his DITE numerous times : he burned it out after the first inter-platoon match , burned out the Adamandite after defeating the matured Pollutant Beast , and had it broken by Haia during their first encounter . All this was due to his immense kei quantity and velocity which only a Heaven 's Blade can withstand . Harley and Chilieck ( the creator of Adamandite , who does not appear in the anime ) are currently working on it so Layfon can fight with the most advantage he has , his enormous amount of kei .
