The original idea as I understood it -- and Lucas changes his mind off and on , so it may not be what he 's thinking right now -- but it was going to be three generations . You 'd have the original trilogy , then go back to Luke 's father and find out what happened to him , and if there was another seventh , eighth , or ninth film , it would be Luke 's children .
