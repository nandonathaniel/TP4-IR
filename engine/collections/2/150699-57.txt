Stravinsky proved adept at playing the part of a ' man of the world ' , acquiring a keen instinct for business matters and appearing relaxed and comfortable in public . His successful career as a pianist and conductor took him to many of the world 's major cities , including Paris , Venice , Berlin , London , Amsterdam and New York and he was known for his polite , courteous and helpful manner . Stravinsky was reputed to have been a philanderer and was rumoured to have had affairs with high - profile partners , such as Coco Chanel . He never referred to it himself , but Chanel spoke about the alleged affair at length to her biographer Paul Morand in 1946 ; the conversation was published thirty years later . The accuracy of Chanel 's claims has been disputed by both Stravinsky 's widow , Vera , and by Craft . Chanel 's fashion house avers there is no evidence that any affair between Chanel and Stravinsky ever occurred . A fictionalization of the supposed affair formed the basis of the novel Coco and Igor ( 2002 ) and a film , Coco Chanel & Igor Stravinsky ( 2009 ) . Despite these alleged liaisons , Stravinsky was considered a family man and devoted to his children .
