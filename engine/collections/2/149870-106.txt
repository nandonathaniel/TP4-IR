Augustus was granted the right to hang the corona civica above his door , the `` civic crown '' made from oak , and to have laurels drape his doorposts . This crown was usually held above the head of a Roman general during a triumph , with the individual holding the crown charged to continually repeat to the general `` memento mori '' , or `` Remember that you are mortal '' . Additionally , laurel wreaths were important in several state ceremonies , and crowns of laurel were rewarded to champions of athletic , racing , and dramatic contests . Thus , both the laurel and the oak were integral symbols of Roman religion and statecraft ; placing them on Augustus ' doorposts was tantamount to declaring his home the capital .
