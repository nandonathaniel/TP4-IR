The Expendables -- led by Barney Ross and formed by Lee Christmas , Gunner Jensen , and Toll Road -- extract former member Doctor Death , a knives specialist and team medic , from a military prison during his transfer on a train . They recruit Doc to assist them in intercepting a shipment of bombs meant to be delivered to a warlord in Somalia . Arriving there , they reunite with Hale Caesar , who directs them to the drop point , where Ross is surprised to find out that the arms trader providing the bombs is Conrad Stonebanks , a former co-founder of the Expendables who went rogue and was presumed dead . In the ensuing firefight , The Expendables manage to kill all but Stonebanks , who shoots Caesar twice . As the team attempts to aid him , they are forced to retreat due to Stonebanks ' advanced weaponry , and Caesar is severely injured in the process .
