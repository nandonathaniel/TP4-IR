Once purchased by Sightholders ( which is a trademark term referring to the companies that have a three - year supply contract with DTC ) , diamonds are cut and polished in preparation for sale as gemstones ( ' industrial ' stones are regarded as a by - product of the gemstone market ; they are used for abrasives ) . The cutting and polishing of rough diamonds is a specialized skill that is concentrated in a limited number of locations worldwide . Traditional diamond cutting centers are Antwerp , Amsterdam , Johannesburg , New York City , and Tel Aviv . Recently , diamond cutting centers have been established in China , India , Thailand , Namibia and Botswana . Cutting centers with lower cost of labor , notably Surat in Gujarat , India , handle a larger number of smaller carat diamonds , while smaller quantities of larger or more valuable diamonds are more likely to be handled in Europe or North America . The recent expansion of this industry in India , employing low cost labor , has allowed smaller diamonds to be prepared as gems in greater quantities than was previously economically feasible .
