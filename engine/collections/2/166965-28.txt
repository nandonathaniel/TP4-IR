Shoaib 's beautiful girlfriend , Mumtaz ( Prachi Desai ) , works in a local jewellery shop , which Shoaib visits often , to the aggravation of the girl 's boss . Shoaib gives her a beautiful necklace , which , unbeknownst to Mumtaz , Shoaib had stolen from a lady during a home robbery . Later , that lady comes to the shop with her husband to buy more jewellery . The lady soon recognises her own necklace being worn by Mumtaz ; she then admits to the outraged customer that her boyfriend had given the item to her . The lady and her husband demand she take them to her boyfriend 's shop , where they confront him . This enrages Shoaib , who beats up the husband and destroys his own shop .
