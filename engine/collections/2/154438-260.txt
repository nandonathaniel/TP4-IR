This policy of price control was coeval with the Committee of Public Safety 's rise to power and the Reign of Terror . The Committee first attempted to set the price for only a limited number of grain products but , by September 1793 , it expanded the `` maximum '' to cover all foodstuffs and a long list of other goods . Widespread shortages and famine ensued . The Committee reacted by sending dragoons into the countryside to arrest farmers and seize crops . This temporarily solved the problem in Paris , but the rest of the country suffered . By the spring of 1794 , forced collection of food was not sufficient to feed even Paris and the days of the Committee were numbered . When Robespierre went to the guillotine in July of that year the crowd jeered , `` There goes the dirty maximum ! ''
