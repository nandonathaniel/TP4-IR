This is the list of countries that border only one other country , with only land borders being counted . Some of these countries have several neighbours `` across the sea '' . As an example Denmark `` borders '' Sweden and Norway by sea , and Canada has sea boundaries with Denmark ( between Baffin Island and Greenland ) and France ( between the island of Newfoundland and the territory of St. Pierre and Miquelon ) . Other countries , such as Sri Lanka , border only one other country by sea .
