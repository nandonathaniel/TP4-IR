A June 2007 report released by the American Society of Civil Engineers determined that the failures of the levees and floodwalls in New Orleans were found to be primarily the result of system design and construction flaws . The US Army Corps of Engineers is federally mandated in the Flood Control Act of 1965 with responsibility for the conception , design and construction of the region 's flood - control system . According to report published in August 2015 in the official journal of the World Water Council , the corps misinterpreted the results of a 1985 study and wrongly concluded that sheet piles in the flood walls needed to be driven to depths of only 17 feet ( 5 m ) instead of between 31 and 46 feet ( 9 and 14 m ) . That decision saved approximately US $100 million , but significantly reduced overall engineering reliability .
