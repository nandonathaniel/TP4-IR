After a decisive victory of the Holy Roman Empire and Bohemia over invading Magyars in the 955 Battle of Lechfeld , Boleslaus I of Bohemia was granted the March of Moravia by German emperor Otto the Great . Bohemia would remain a largely autonomous state under the Holy Roman Empire for several decades . The jurisdiction of the Holy Roman Empire was definitively reasserted when Jarom√≠r of Bohemia was granted fief of the Kingdom of Bohemia by Emperor King Henry II of the Holy Roman Empire , with the promise that he hold it as a vassal once he re-occupied Prague with a German army in 1004 , ending the rule of Boleslaw I of Poland .
