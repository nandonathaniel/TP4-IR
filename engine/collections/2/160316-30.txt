Due to the intelligibility of certain languages across several nations , it has been possible to make regional versions of Big Brother . All of these follow the normal Big Brother rules , except that contestants must come from each of the countries in the region where it airs : Big Brother Albania of Albania and Kosovo , Big Brother Angola e Moçambique of Angola and Mozambique , Big Brother Africa of Africa ( includes Angola , Botswana , Ethiopia , Ghana , Kenya , Liberia , Malawi , Mozambique , Namibia , Nigeria , Rwanda , Sierra Leone , South Africa , Tanzania , Uganda , Zambia and Zimbabwe ) , Big Brother : الرئيس of the Middle East ( includes Bahrain , Egypt , Iraq , Jordan , Kuwait , Lebanon , Oman , Saudi Arabia , Somalia , Syria and Tunisia ) , Gran Hermano del Pacífico of South America ( includes Chile , Ecuador and Peru ) , Big Brother of Scandinavia ( includes Norway and Sweden ) and Veliki brat of the Balkans ( includes Serbia , Montenegro , Croatia , Bosnia and Herzegovina and Macedonia ) . The British version of the show accepts Irish applicants and was available between 2000 and 2010 as Channel 4 was available ; as of 2015 the show returned to Irish screens as TV3 bought the rights from UK broadcaster Channel 5 to air the show .
