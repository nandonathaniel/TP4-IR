Goa remained neutral during the conflict like Portugal . As a result , at the outbreak of hostilities a number of Axis ships sought refuge in Goa rather than be sunk or captured by the British Royal Navy . Three German merchants ships , the Ehrenfels , the Drachenfels and the Braunfels , as well as an Italian ship , took refuge in the port of Mormugao . The Ehrenfels began transmitting Allied ship movements to the U-boats operating in the Indian Ocean , an action that was extremely damaging to Allied shipping .
