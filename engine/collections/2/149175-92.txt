Around 540 BCE , the Battle of Alalia led to a new distribution of power in the western Mediterranean Sea . Though the battle had no clear winner , Carthage managed to expand its sphere of influence at the expense of the Greeks , and Etruria saw itself relegated to the northern Tyrrhenian Sea with full ownership of Corsica . From the first half of the 5th century , the new international political situation meant the beginning of the Etruscan decline after losing their southern provinces . In 480 BCE , Etruria 's ally Carthage was defeated by a coalition of Magna Graecia cities led by Syracuse .
