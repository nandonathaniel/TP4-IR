Wernicke -- Korsakoff syndrome is a neurological disorder typically characterized by years of chronic alcohol abuse and a nutritional thiamine deficiency . Confabulation is one salient symptom of this syndrome . A study on confabulation in Korsakoff 's patients found that they are subject to provoked confabulation when prompted with questions pertaining to episodic memory , not semantic memory , and when prompted with questions where the appropriate response would be `` I do n't know . '' This suggests that confabulation in these patients is `` domain - specific . '' Korsakoff 's patients who confabulate are more likely than healthy adults to falsely recognize distractor words , suggesting that false recognition is a `` confabulatory behavior . ''
