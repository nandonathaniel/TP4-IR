Extremely disgruntled by the experience , the new Warlock left Thanos to ponder his situation , and he eventually ended up on `` New Krall '' acting as a gladiator in a fighting pit . Thanos receives a message through time / space from his omnipotent former self to seek this new Adam Warlock who is now unnaturally more powerful than before . Agreeing , Thanos first seeks Pip the Troll to teleport to New Krall and then contacts Gamora to also go to Adam , as they both are his closest friends and can keep him from doing any damage to the universe . During this time Annihilus begins a re-invasion of the Positive Zone searching for an immense power source that turns out to be Adam himself and launches a devastating siege on New Krall . The Shi'ar , led by Gladiator ( also looking for the power source ) , appear and Annihilus , now with the power of the Hulk and a new fear projection ability , defeats them . Pip swiftly teleports Adam , Gamora , the Guardians of the Galaxy , and himself back to the Guardians ' ship to safety and are joined by Thanos , where they discover the universe that Adam created was not destroyed , but became a part of him and has given him the power of Eternity and Infinity .
