In recent years taller cyclists with low builds have become among the world 's best climbers , particularly on long gradual climbs . The best examples of this are Ivan Basso 1.82 m ( 6 ft 0 in ) who won on the Monte Zoncolan in 2010 , Mauricio Soler 1.90 m ( 6 ft 3 in ) , Chris Froome 1.86 metres ( 6 ft 1 in ) winner of the 2013 Tour de France , and the brothers Andy Schleck and Fr√§nk Schleck both 1.86 m ( 6 ft 1 in ) who specialise on the Alpine stages of the Tour de France .
