The Web.com Tour is the developmental tour for the U.S. - based PGA Tour , and features professional golfers who have either not yet reached the PGA Tour , or who have done so but then failed to win enough FedEx Cup points to stay at that level . Those who are on the top 25 of the money list at year 's end are given PGA Tour memberships for the next season . Since the 2013 season , the Web.com Tour has been the primary pathway for those seeking to earn their PGA Tour card . Q - School , which had previously been the primary route for qualification to the PGA Tour , has been converted as an entryway to the Web.com tour .
