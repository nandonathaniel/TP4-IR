Passing Passing , or the exchanging of cards between players , is optional and rare in Spades . However , one more common exception relates to Nil bids , which are generally considered difficult to make , especially when the bid was blindly made . To offset this difficulty slightly , a partnership in which one player has bid Nil or Blind Nil can choose to pass two cards between players ; the most common arrangement is one card for regular nil and two cards for blind nil . When passing , the partners agree on a number of cards to pass , then select that number of cards and place them face down in front of their partner . Neither partner should look at the cards passed to them before they have passed their own cards . In passing this way , the idea is for the partner who bid Nil to offload their highest trumps or other face cards in return for low cards from their partner , which both decreases the likelihood that the nil bidder can be forced to take a trick , and increases the likelihood that his partner will be able to `` cover '' , or overplay high cards the nil bidder still holds that would otherwise take a trick . The number of cards passed should be determined before the game begins so that each team can use this as they bid .
