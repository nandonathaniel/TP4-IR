NBC is the current home of the annual Pro Football Hall of Fame Game , which begins the NFL 's preseason each August . However , the 2007 game aired on the NFL Network as the league had planned to stage the China Bowl just a few days later ( before it was postponed indefinitely ) , to be televised by NBC as a tie - in to its coverage of the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing . Normally , there are two other preseason telecasts on NBC ; however , because of the Beijing Olympics , only two were shown in 2008 . Two preseason games ( the Hall of Fame game and one other match - up , depending on other NBC Sports commitments ) , and the Thursday night season opener were retained as part of the new contract beginning in 2014 .
