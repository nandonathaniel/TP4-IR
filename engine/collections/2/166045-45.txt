The Tariff of 1828 , also known as the Tariff of Abominations , and the Tariff of 1832 accelerated sectionalism between the North and the South . For a brief moment in 1832 , South Carolina made vague threats to leave the Union over the tariff issue . In 1833 , to ease North - South relations , Congress lowered the tariffs . In the 1850s , the South gained greater influence over tariff policy and made subsequent reductions .
