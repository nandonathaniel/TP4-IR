Matt Nable portrays Raʾs al Ghul ( Arabic : رأس الغول ‎ ‎ ; `` The Demon 's Head '' ) , the main antagonist of the third season and leader of the League of Assassins who has lived for at least two centuries ( having been born some decades before 1854 ) due to the use of the Lazarus Pit , a pool which can heal wounds and bring the dead back to life . He is the father of Nyssa al Ghul . Raʾs has never acknowledged Sara as a member of the League and disapproves of Nyssa 's relationship with her . Oliver claims to have killed Sara and challenges Raʾs to a trial by combat which Raʾs easily wins , nearly killing Oliver by stabbing him through the chest . Raʾs wants to make Oliver his heir -- the new Raʾs al Ghul -- because Oliver is the only man to survive a death match against him , fulfilling a League prophecy regarding his destined successor . Raʾs become fixated with Oliver , neglecting other candidates , and becomes estranged with his daughter . When Oliver refuses his offer , Raʾs orders the League to kill the people of Starling City ; he stabs Thea and leaves her near death , with a cure via the Lazarus Pit available only if Oliver agrees to become his heir . Oliver accedes , and Raʾs names him `` Al Sah - Him '' . After Oliver captures Nyssa , Raʾs forces an engagement between them . He also orders Oliver to unleash the Alpha / Omega bioweapon on Starling City , oblivious that Oliver was working with Malcolm and Nyssa to take down the League from the inside . In the season finale , Oliver kills Raʾs . Malcolm becomes Raʾs successor of the League 's leadership , and thus its prophecy is fulfilled as Malcolm survived an assault by Raʾs during his captivity .
