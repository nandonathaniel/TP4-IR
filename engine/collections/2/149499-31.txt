The Party 's third Conference in 1922 saw the consolidation of the leadership around the `` Three W 's '' - Adolf Warski , Maksymilian Horwitz and Maria Koszutska . The party was able to assume a stable organisational form and founded Red Factions within the unions . An electoral list was constructed called the `` Union of Town and Country Proletariat '' . Yet the party only managed to win 130,000 votes and two seats in the November 1922 elections . In general the idea of the `` United Front '' - recently made policy by the Communist International ( Comintern ) - provided a guide for the party 's activities .
