Two omnibus editions were created by Douglas Adams to combine the Hitchhiker series novels and to `` set the record straight '' . The stories came in so many different formats that Adams stated that every time he told it he would contradict himself . Therefore , he stated in the introduction of The More Than Complete Hitchhiker 's Guide that `` anything I put down wrong here is , as far as I 'm concerned , wrong for good . '' The two omnibus editions were The More Than Complete Hitchhiker 's Guide , Complete and Unabridged ( published in 1987 ) and The Ultimate Hitchhiker 's Guide , Complete and Unabridged ( published in 1997 ) .
