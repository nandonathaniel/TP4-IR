Unlike most other Vaishnavite schools such as those of Ramanuja , Madhva and Chaitanya , Swaminarayan , guru of the Hindu Swaminarayan sects ( including BAPS ) , did not differentiate between Vishnu , Brahma and Shiva ; Swaminarayan notably differs from practically all Vaishnavite schools in holding that Vishnu and Shiva are different aspects of the same God . ( see also verses 47 and 84 of Shikshapatri , a key scripture to all followers of the Swaminarayan faith . ) Moreover , Swaminarayan followed a Smarta approach ( see more detail on the Smarta view below ) by instructing his followers to venerate all five deities of the Panchayatana puja with equal reverence .
