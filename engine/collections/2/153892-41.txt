Cloud Gate is described as a transformative , iconic work . It is similar to many of Kapoor 's previous works in the themes and issues it addresses . While the sculpture 's mirror effects are reminiscent of fun - house fairground mirrors , they also have a more serious intent ; they help dematerialize this very large object , making it seem light and almost weightless . Cloud Gate is considered Kapoor 's most ambitious use of complex mirrored form dynamics . Kapoor challenges his viewers to internalize his work through intellectual and theoretical exercise . By reflecting the sky , visiting and non-visiting pedestrians and surrounding architecture , Cloud Gate limits its viewers to partial comprehension at any time . The interaction with the viewer who moves to create his own vision gives it a spiritual dimension . The sculpture is described as a disembodied , luminous form , which is also how his earlier 1000 Names ( 1979 -- 80 ) was described when it addressed the metaphysical and mystical .
