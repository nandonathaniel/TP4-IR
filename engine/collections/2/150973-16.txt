November : The term ' virus ' is coined by Frederick Cohen in describing self - replicating computer programs . In 1984 Cohen uses the phrase `` computer virus '' -- as suggested by his teacher Leonard Adleman -- to describe the operation of such programs in terms of `` infection '' . He defines a ' virus ' as `` a program that can ' infect ' other programs by modifying them to include a possibly evolved copy of itself . '' Cohen demonstrates a virus - like program on a VAX11 / 750 system at Lehigh University . The program could install itself in , or infect , other system objects .
