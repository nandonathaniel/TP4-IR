The protection of the indigenous populations from enslavement and exploitation by Spanish settlers were established in the Laws of Burgos , 1512 -- 1513 . The laws were the first codified set of laws governing the behavior of Spanish settlers in the Americas , particularly with regards to treatment of native Indians in the institution of the encomienda . They forbade the maltreatment of natives , and endorsed the Indian Reductions with attempts of conversion to Catholicism . Upon their failure to effectively protect the indigenous and following the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire and the Spanish conquest of the Inca Empire , more stringent laws to control conquerors ' and settlers ' exercise of power , especially their maltreatment of the indigenous populations , were promulgated , known as the New Laws ( 1542 ) . The crown aimed to prevent the formation of an aristocracy in the Indies not under crown control .
