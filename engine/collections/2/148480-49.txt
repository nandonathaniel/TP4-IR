Cicero 's case was divided into three parts . The first part detailed exactly the charge brought by Ericius . Cicero explained how a rustic son of a farmer , who lives off the pleasures of his own land , would not have gained anything from committing patricide because he would have eventually inherited his father 's land anyway . The second part concerned the boldness and greed of two of the accusers , Magnus and Capito . Cicero told the jury that they were the more likely perpetrators of murder because the two were greedy , both for conspiring together against a fellow kinsman and , in particular , Magnus , for his boldness and for being unashamed to appear in court to support the false charges . The third part explained that Chrysogonus had immense political power , and the accusation was successfully made due to that power . Even though Chrysogonus may not have been what Cicero said he was , through rhetoric Cicero successfully made him appear to be a foreign freed man who prospered by devious means in the aftermath of the civil war . Cicero surmised that it showed what kind of a person he was and that something like murder was not beneath him .
