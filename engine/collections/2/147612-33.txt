Along with her colleagues from Hull House , in 1901 Jane Addams founded what would become the Juvenile Protective Association . JPA provided the first probation officers for the first Juvenile Court in the United States until this became a government function . From 1907 until the 1940s , JPA engaged in many studies examining such subjects as racism , child labor and exploitation , drug abuse and prostitution in Chicago and their effects on child development . Through the years , their mission has now become to improve the social and emotional well - being and functioning of vulnerable children so they can reach their fullest potential at home , in school , and in their communities .
