A mid sixth century BC Laconian cup , by the Hunt Painter , adds several new features to the scene which also become common in later works : three heads , a snake tail , Cerberus ' chain and Heracles ' club . Here Cerberus has three canine heads , is covered by a shaggy coat of snakes , and has a tail which ends in a snake head . He is being held on a chain leash by Heracles who holds his club raised over head .
