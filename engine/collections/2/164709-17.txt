In private health insurance , premiums are paid directly from employers , associations , individuals and families to insurance companies , which pool risks across their membership base . Private insurance includes policies sold by commercial for profit firms , non-profit companies , and community health insurers . Generally , private insurance is voluntary in contrast to social insurance programs , which tend to be compulsory .
