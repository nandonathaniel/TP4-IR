Little Shop of Horrors was the first DVD to be recalled for content . In 1998 , Warner Bros. released a special edition DVD that contained approximately 23 minutes of unfinished footage from Oz 's original ending , although it was in black and white and was missing some sound , visual , and special effects . Producer and rights owner David Geffen was not aware of this release until it made it to the stores . Geffen said , `` They put out a black - and - white , un-scored , un-dubbed video copy of the original ending that looked like shit . '' As a result , the studio removed it from shelves in a matter of days and replaced it with a second edition that did not contain the extra material . Geffen wanted to re-release the film to theaters with the original ending intact . Geffen also claimed to have a color copy of the original ending , while the studio had lower quality , black and white duplicates as their own color print was destroyed in a studio fire years earlier . But Geffen had not known , until after the DVD was pulled , that the studio did not know there was a colored copy of the original ending in existence .
