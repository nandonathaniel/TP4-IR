On December 10 , 2012 , in an attempt to strengthen the pitching staff ( which was among the worst in baseball in 2012 ) , the Royals traded for Rays pitchers James Shields and Wade Davis giving Tampa top prospects Wil Myers , Jake Odorizzi , Mike Montgomery , and Patrick Leonard . This trade helped catalyze a return to winning records .
