Meanwhile , on 4 November , two companies from the 2nd Marine Raider Battalion , commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Evans Carlson landed by boat at Aola Bay , 40 miles ( 64 km ) east of Lunga Point . Carlson 's raiders , along with troops from the U.S. Army 's 147th Infantry Regiment , were to provide security for 500 Seabees as they attempted to construct an airfield at that location . Halsey , acting on a recommendation by Turner , had approved the Aola Bay airfield construction effort . The Aola airfield construction effort was later abandoned at the end of November because of unsuitable terrain .
