If the U.S. investigation concludes that a country has violated a trade agreement Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 allows the U.S. government to impose unilateral trade sanctions if the country is not member of the World Trade Organisation ( WTO ) or any other trade agreement establishing dispute settlement provisions , such as free trade agreements , which are relevant to the alleged violation . Unilateral trade sanctions under section 301 were imposed on December 20 , 2001 , on Ukraine , which was not yet a WTO member state , by imposing a prohibitive tariff on metals , footwear , and other imports because the USTR concluded that the country had failed to enact legislation to enforce copyright in relation to music CDs and their export .
