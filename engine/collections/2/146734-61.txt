Although Guillain -- Barré syndrome had been feared as a complication of vaccination , the CDC states that most studies on modern influenza vaccines have seen no link with Guillain -- Barré . Infection with influenza virus itself increases both the risk of death ( up to 1 in 10,000 ) and increases the risk of developing Guillain -- Barré syndrome to a far higher level than the highest level of suspected vaccine involvement ( approximately 10 times higher by 2009 estimates ) .
