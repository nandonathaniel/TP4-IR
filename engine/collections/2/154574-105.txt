In the Spring of 1962 , with funds from the Voter Education Project , SNCC / COFO began voter registration organizing in the Mississippi Delta area around Greenwood , and the areas surrounding Hattiesburg , Laurel , and Holly Springs . As in McComb , their efforts were met with fierce opposition -- arrests , beatings , shootings , arson , and murder . Registrars used the literacy test to keep blacks off the voting roles by creating standards that even highly educated people could not meet . In addition , employers fired blacks who tried to register , and landlords evicted them from their rental homes . Despite these actions , over the following years , the black voter registration campaign spread across the state .
