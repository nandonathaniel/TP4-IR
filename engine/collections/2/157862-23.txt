IIS 7.0 was a complete redesign and rewrite of IIS , and was shipped with Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008 . IIS 7.0 included a new modular design that allowed for a reduced attack surface and increased performance . It also introduced a hierarchical configuration system allowing for simpler site deploys , a new Windows Forms - based management application , new command - line management options and increased support for the . NET Framework . IIS 7.0 on Vista does not limit the number of allowed connections as IIS on XP did , but limits concurrent requests to 10 ( Windows Vista Ultimate , Business , and Enterprise Editions ) or 3 ( Vista Home Premium ) . Additional requests are queued , which hampers performance , but they are not rejected as with XP .
