On a political level it was also felt that the previous lack of consultation between rulers and ruled had been another significant factor in contributing to the uprising . In consequence , Indians were drawn into government at a local level . Though this was on a limited scale a crucial precedent had been set , with the creation of a new ' white collar ' Indian elite , further stimulated by the opening of universities at Calcutta , Bombay and Madras , a result of the Indian Universities Act . So , alongside the values of traditional and ancient India , a new professional middle class was starting to arise , in no way bound by the values of the past . Their ambition can only have been stimulated by Queen Victoria 's Proclamation of November 1858 , in which it is expressly stated , `` We hold ourselves bound to the natives of our Indian territories by the same obligations of duty which bind us to our other subjects ... it is our further will that ... our subjects of whatever race or creed , be freely and impartially admitted to offices in our service , the duties of which they may be qualified by their education , ability and integrity , duly to discharge .
