The decline in military use of shotguns reversed in World War I. American forces under General Pershing employed 12 - gauge pump action shotguns when they were deployed to the Western front in 1917 . These shotguns were fitted with bayonets and a heat shield so the barrel could be gripped while the bayonet was deployed . Shotguns fitted in this fashion became known as trench guns by the United States Army . Those without such modifications were known as riot guns . After World War I , the United States military began referring to all shotguns as riot guns .
