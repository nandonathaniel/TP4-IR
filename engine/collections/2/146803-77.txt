Until recently each had left open at least one loophole by which it was possible to question the validity of the results . However , in 2015 an experiment was performed that simultaneously closed both the detection and locality loopholes , and was heralded as `` loophole - free '' ; this experiment ruled out a large class of local realism theories with certainty . Alain Aspect notes that the setting - independence loophole , which he refers to as `` far - fetched '' yet a `` residual loophole '' that `` can not be ignored '' has yet to be closed , and the free - will , or superdeterminism , loophole is unclosable , saying `` no experiment , as ideal as it is , can be said to be totally loophole - free .
