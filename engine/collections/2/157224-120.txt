The editors of TV Guide placed Designated Survivor first among the top ten picks for the most anticipated new shows of the 2016 -- 17 season . In writer Alexander Zalben 's overall review , he pointed out the keys to one of the strongest pilots he had seen so far : `` Designated Survivor is the rare show that delivers on the hype , and surpasses it , '' and later stating `` It 's shocking that a show can balance all of these elements , but credit a magnetic cast that hits the ground running , a crack script that makes the first hour feel like 10 minutes and , of course , Sutherland as the anchor that keeps it all grounded . '' Zalben 's review concluded with this recommendation : `` There 's a reason Designated Survivor was n't just the top pick across all of our Editors ' lists , but also on the list compiled from TVGuide.com viewers ' Watchlist adds : this is a show that delivers on its premise , feels timely , and most importantly , is a ton of fun .
