Retirement of the Baby Boom generation -- which by 2030 is projected to increase enrollment to more than 80 million as the number of workers per enrollee declines from 3.7 to 2.4 -- and rising overall health care costs pose substantial financial challenges to the program . Medicare spending is projected to increase from $523 billion in 2010 to just over $1 trillion by 2022 . Baby - boomers ' health is also an important factor : 20 % have five or more chronic conditions , which will add to the future cost of health care ( www.cms.gov , 2012 ) . In response to these financial challenges , Congress made substantial cuts to future payouts to providers as part of PPACA in 2010 and the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 ( MACRA ) and policymakers have offered a number of additional competing proposals to reduce Medicare costs further .
