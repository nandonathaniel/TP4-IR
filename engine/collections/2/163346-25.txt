The combat has changed since the last game , now taking the form of a grid system with players being able to move around the grid . Players take turns attacking , and when getting attacked , players can do a quick time event to reduce damage and fill a super meter . One non-player character , PC Principal , can teach the player the ability to recognize microaggressions , which allows the player a free attack in battle against an enemy that says a demeaning term for a demographic .
