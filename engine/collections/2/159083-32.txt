KARR 2.0 ( Peter Cullen ) is mentioned in the new Knight Rider series episode `` Knight of the Living Dead '' , and is said to be a prototype of KITT ( Knight Industries Three Thousand ) . The new KARR acronym was changed to `` Knight Auto - cybernetic Roving Robotic - exoskeleton '' . Instead of an automobile , a schematic display shows a heavily armed humanoid - looking robot with wheeled legs that converts into an ambiguous off - road vehicle .
