I Love Lucy 's pioneering use of three cameras led to it becoming the standard technique for the production of most sitcoms filmed in front of an audience . Single - camera setups remained the technique of choice for sitcoms that did not use audiences . This led to an unexpected benefit for Desilu during the series 's second season when it was discovered that Lucy was pregnant . Not being able to fulfill the show 's 39 - episode commitment , both Desi and Jess Oppenheimer decided to rebroadcast popular episodes of the series 's first season to help give Lucy the necessary rest she needed after she gave birth , effectively allowing fewer episodes to be filmed that season . Unexpectedly the rebroadcasts proved to be ratings winners , effectively giving birth to the rerun , which would later lead to the profitable development of the rerun syndication market .
