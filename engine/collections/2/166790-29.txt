Lasse Louhento had started at Bloodhouse , and Lassi Leppinen was the chief programmer at Sumea and Digital Chocolate . Their team had spent months on a fantasy themed Facebook game when Supercell changed strategies . Leppinen and Louhento wanted to make a strategy game that would use a touch screen so playing would be as simple and pleasant as possible . The development of Clash of Clans took six months , and the game was released on August 2nd 2012 . In three months , it became the most profitable app in the US . According to App Annie , in the years 2013 and 2014 Clash of Clans was the most profitable mobile game in the world . The eponymous battle between the clans was added to the game as late as in 2014 .
