Westminster Hall has served numerous functions . Until the 19th century , it was primarily used for judicial purposes , housing three of the most important courts in the land : the Court of King 's Bench , the Court of Common Pleas and the Court of Chancery . In 1875 , these courts were amalgamated into the High Court of Justice , which continued to meet in Westminster Hall until it moved to the Royal Courts of Justice in 1882 . In addition to regular courts , Westminster Hall also housed important trials , including impeachment trials and the state trials of King Charles I at the end of the English Civil War , William Wallace , Thomas More , Cardinal John Fisher , Guy Fawkes , the Earl of Strafford , the rebel Scottish lords of the 1715 and 1745 uprisings , and Warren Hastings . The St Stephen 's Porch end of the Hall displays under the stained glass window the Parliamentary War Memorial listing on eight panels the names of Members and staff of both Houses of Parliament and their sons killed serving in the First World War ; the window itself , installed in 1952 , commemorates members and staff of both Houses who died in the Second World War . In 2012 , a new stained glass window commemorating Elizabeth II 's diamond jubilee was installed opposite this window , at the other end of the hall .
