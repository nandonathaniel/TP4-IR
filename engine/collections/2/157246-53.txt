The video card -- otherwise called a graphics card , graphics adapter or video adapter -- processes the graphics output from the motherboard and transmits it to the display . It is an essential part of modern multimedia - enriched computing . Graphics circuitry may be integrated with the motherboard , or may be on cards istalled in PCI , AGP , or PCI Express slots . When the IBM PC was introduced , most existing business - oriented personal computers used text - only display adapters and had no graphics capability . Home computers at that time had graphics compatible with television signals , but with low resolution owing to the limited memory available to the eight - bit processors available at the time .
