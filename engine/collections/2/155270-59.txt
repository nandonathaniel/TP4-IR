In 1949 , MGM sold Roach the back catalog of 1927 -- 1938 Our Gang silent and talking shorts , while retaining the rights to the Our Gang name , the 52 Our Gang films it produced , and the feature General Spanky . Under the terms of the sale , Roach was required to remove the MGM Lion studio logo and all instances of the names or logos `` Metro - Goldwyn - Mayer '' , `` Loew 's Incorporated '' , and Our Gang from the reissued film prints . Using a modified version of the series ' original name , Roach repackaged 79 of the 80 sound Our Gang shorts as The Little Rascals . Monogram Pictures and its successor , Allied Artists , reissued the films to theaters beginning in 1951 . Allied Artists ' television department , Interstate Television , syndicated the films to TV in 1955 .
