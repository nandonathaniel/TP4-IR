The original score was composed by Carter Burwell , a veteran of all the Coen Brothers ' films . While the Coens were writing the screenplay they had Kenny Rogers ' `` Just Dropped In ( to See What Condition My Condition Was in ) '' , the Gipsy Kings ' cover of `` Hotel California '' , and several Creedence Clearwater Revival songs in mind . They asked T - Bone Burnett ( who would later work with the Coens on O Brother , Where Art Thou ? and Inside Llewyn Davis ) to pick songs for the soundtrack of the film . They knew that they wanted different genres of music from different times but , as Joel remembers , `` T - Bone even came up with some far - out Henry Mancini and Yma Sumac . '' Burnett was able to secure songs by Kenny Rogers and the Gipsy Kings and also added tracks by Captain Beefheart , Moondog and Bob Dylan 's `` The Man in Me '' ( from New Morning ) . However , he had a tough time securing the rights to Townes Van Zandt 's cover of the Rolling Stones ' `` Dead Flowers '' , which plays over the film 's closing credits . Former Stones manager Allen Klein owned the rights to the song and wanted $150,000 for it . Burnett convinced Klein to watch an early cut of the film and remembers , `` It got to the part where the Dude says , ' I hate the fuckin ' Eagles , man ! ' Klein stands up and says , ' That 's it , you can have the song ! ' That was beautiful . '' Burnett was going to be credited on the film as `` Music Supervisor '' , but asked his credit to be `` Music Archivist '' because he `` hated the notion of being a supervisor ; I would n't want anyone to think of me as management '' .
