Certain religious rites are performed during and after the death of a Muslim . Those near a dying man encourage him to pronounce the Shahada as Muslims want their last word to be their profession of faith . After the death , the body is bathed properly by the members of the same gender and then enshrouded in a threefold white garment called kafan . Placing the body on a bier , it is first taken to a mosque where funeral prayer is offered for the dead person , and then to the graveyard for burial .
