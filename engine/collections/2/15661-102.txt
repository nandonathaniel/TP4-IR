The stern section seems to have descended almost vertically , probably rotating as it fell . Empty tanks and cofferdams imploded as it descended , tearing open the structure and folding back the steel ribbing of the poop deck . The section landed with such force that it buried itself about 15 metres ( 49 ft ) deep at the rudder . The decks pancaked down on top of each other and the hull plating splayed out to the sides . Debris continued to rain down across the seabed for several hours after the sinking .
