The electrical units of measure did not easily fit into the coherent system of mechanical units defined by the BAAS . Using dimensional analysis , the dimensions of voltage M 1 2 L 1 2 T âˆ’ 1 ( \ displaystyle ( \ mathsf ( M ) ) ^ ( \ frac ( 1 ) ( 2 ) ) ( \ mathsf ( L ) ) ^ ( \ frac ( 1 ) ( 2 ) ) ( \ mathsf ( T ) ) ^ ( - 1 ) ) in the ESU system were identical to the dimensions of current in the EMU system , while resistance had dimensions of velocity in the EMU system , but the inverse of velocity in the ESU system .
