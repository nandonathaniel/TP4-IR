Captain America 's uniform was altered from the ones seen in previous films , with a Kevlar - based ballistic component that would protect Captain America but at the same time function like a military uniform . Joe Russo said , `` We wanted to use his Super Soldier outfit from the ( Steve Rogers : Super Soldier series ) as a way to represent , thematically , his place in the world of S.H.I.E.L.D. and the difference between working for S.H.I.E.L.D. and being Captain America . '' For the Falcon costume , the filmmakers were interested in adding more of a tactical design than was represented in the comic books , by including real - world webbing , straps and gear and stripping away the more comic book elements .
