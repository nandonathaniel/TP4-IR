This spoken Latin differed from the literary language of Classical Latin in its grammar and vocabulary . It is likely to have evolved over time , with some features not appearing until the late Empire . Other features are likely to have been in place much earlier . Because there are few phonetic transcriptions of the daily speech of these Latin speakers ( to match , for example , the post-classical Appendix Probi ) Vulgar Latin must be studied mainly by indirect methods .
