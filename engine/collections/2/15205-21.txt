In his recollection of the creation of the Pledge Francis Bellamy said , `` At the beginning of the nineties patriotism and national feeling was ( sic ) at a low ebb . The patriotic ardor of the Civil War was an old story ... The time was ripe for a reawakening of simple Americanism and the leaders in the new movement rightly felt that patriotic education should begin in the public schools . '' James Upham `` felt that a flag should be on every schoolhouse , '' so his publication `` fostered a plan of selling flags to schools through the children themselves at cost , which was so successful that 25,000 schools acquired flags in the first year ( 1892 - 93 ) .
