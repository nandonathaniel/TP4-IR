René Ramón Sánchez , a legal Dominican Republic immigrant to the US , was arrested on July 15 , 1995 , on a charge of driving while intoxicated . His fingerprints were mistakenly placed on a card containing the name , Social Security number and other data for one Leo Rosario , who was being processed at the same time . Leo Rosario had been arrested for selling cocaine to an undercover police officer . On October 11 , 2000 , while returning from a visit to relatives in the Dominican Republic , René was misidentified as Leo Rosario at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York and arrested . Even though he did not match the physical description of Rosario , the erroneously cataloged fingerprints were considered to be more reliable .
