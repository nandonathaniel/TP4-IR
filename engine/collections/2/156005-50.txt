The resolution supposes that dangerous powers , not delegated , may not only be usurped and executed by the other departments , but that the judicial department , also , may exercise or sanction dangerous powers beyond the grant of the Constitution ; and , consequently , that the ultimate right of the parties to the Constitution , to judge whether the compact has been dangerously violated , must extend to violations by one delegated authority as well as by another -- by the judiciary as well as by the executive , or the legislature .
