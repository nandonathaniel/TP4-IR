A French press works best with coffee of a coarser grind than does a drip brew coffee filter , about the consistency of kosher salt . Finer grounds , when immersed in water , have lower permeability , requiring an excessive amount of force to be applied by hand to lower the plunger and are more likely to seep through or around the perimeter of the press filter and into the coffee . Additionally , finer grounds will tend to over-extract and cause the coffee to taste bitter .
