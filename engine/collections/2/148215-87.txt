The park 's anti-poaching unit consists of 650 SANParks game rangers , assisted by the SAPS and the SANDF ( including the SAAF ) . As of 2013 , the park is equipped with two drones borrowed from Denel and two AÃ©rospatiale Gazelle helicopters , donated by the RAF to augment its air space presence . Automated movement sensors relay intrusions along the Mozambique border to a control center , and a specialist dog unit has been introduced . Buffer zones have been established along the border with Mozambique , from where many poachers have infiltrated the park , as an alternative to costly new fences . The original 150 km long fences were dropped in 2002 to establish the Great Limpopo Transfrontier Park . The national anti-poaching committee oversees all activities and coordinates interested parties .
