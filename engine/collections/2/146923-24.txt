The manufacture sequence of Still Bay points has been divided into four main production phases . While hard hammer and direct percussion was used in the initial reduction phase ( phase 1 ) , followed by soft hammer and marginal percussion ( phase 2 ) , pressure flaking was only used during the final retouch phase ( 3 ) , and a few points were also reworked by hard hammer percussion ( phase 4 ) ( ) . For the moment , the Still Bay points from Blombos Cave represent some of the earliest evidence for pressure flaking , a technique more common in considerably more recent lithic techno - complexes . Experimental replication by Mourre et al. 2010 and microscopic study of Still Bay points from Blombos Cave indicates that some silcrete blanks were deliberately heat - treated , before pressure flaking was employed in the final reduction sequence ; and thus improving the silcrete 's flaking quality .
