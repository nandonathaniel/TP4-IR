The expedition documented natural resources and plants that had been previously unknown to Euro - Americans , though not to the indigenous peoples . Lewis and Clark were the first Americans to cross the Continental Divide , and the first Americans to see Yellowstone , enter into Montana , and produce an official description of these different regions . Their visit to the Pacific Northwest , maps , and proclamations of sovereignty with medals and flags were legal steps needed to claim title to each indigenous nation 's lands under the Doctrine of Discovery .
