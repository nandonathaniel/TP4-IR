The original concept of Prison Break -- a man deliberately getting himself sent to prison in order to help someone escape -- was suggested to Paul Scheuring by producer Dawn Parouse , who wanted to produce an action - oriented series . Although Scheuring thought it was a good idea , he was initially stumped as to why someone would embark on such a mission or how he could develop it into a viable television show . He came up with the story of the wrongfully accused brother , and began working on the plot outline and devising the characters . In 2003 , he pitched the idea to the Fox Broadcasting Company but was turned down as Fox felt nervous about the long - term possibilities of such a series . He subsequently showed the concept to other channels but was also turned down as it was thought to be more suited for a film project than a television series . Prison Break was later considered as a possible 14 - part miniseries , which drew the interest of Steven Spielberg before his departure due to his involvement with War of the Worlds . Thus , the miniseries never materialized . Following the huge popularity of serialized prime time television series such as Lost and 24 , Fox decided to back the production in 2004 . The pilot episode was filmed a year after Scheuring wrote the script .
