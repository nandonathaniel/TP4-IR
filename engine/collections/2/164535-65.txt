Nuclear warfare strategy is a set of policies that deal with preventing or fighting a nuclear war . The policy of trying to prevent an attack by a nuclear weapon from another country by threatening nuclear retaliation is known as the strategy of nuclear deterrence . The goal in deterrence is to always maintain a second strike capability ( the ability of a country to respond to a nuclear attack with one of its own ) and potentially to strive for first strike status ( the ability to destroy an enemy 's nuclear forces before they could retaliate ) . During the Cold War , policy and military theorists considered the sorts of policies that might prevent a nuclear attack , and they developed game theory models that could lead to stable deterrence conditions .
