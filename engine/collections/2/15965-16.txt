There are three main manufacturers of cricket ball used in international matches : Kookaburra , Dukes and SG . The manufacturer of the red ( or pink ) balls used for Tests varies depending on location : India uses SG , England and the West Indies use Dukes , and all other countries use Kookaburra . The different manufacturers ' balls behave differently -- e.g. Dukes balls have a prouder seam and will tend to swing more than a Kookaburra ball -- providing a home advantage when playing against a team unfamiliar with the ball . All limited overs international matches , regardless of location , are played with white Kookaburra balls . White Dukes balls were used at the 1999 Cricket World Cup , but the ball behaved more erratically than the Kookaburra and has not since been used . Domestic competitions may use a domestic manufacturer : for example , Pakistan uses Grays balls in its first - class competitions .
