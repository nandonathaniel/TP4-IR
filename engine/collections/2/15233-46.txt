MC firms sell products that have real or perceived non-price differences . However , the differences are not so great as to eliminate other goods as substitutes . Technically , the cross price elasticity of demand between goods in such a market is positive . In fact , the XED would be high . MC goods are best described as close but imperfect substitutes . The goods perform the same basic functions but have differences in qualities such as type , style , quality , reputation , appearance , and location that tend to distinguish them from each other . For example , the basic function of motor vehicles is the same -- to move people and objects from point to point in reasonable comfort and safety . Yet there are many different types of motor vehicles such as motor scooters , motor cycles , trucks and cars , and many variations even within these categories .
