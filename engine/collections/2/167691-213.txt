A declaration of nullity made by the Catholic Church is distinct from a civil divorce . A civil divorce may serve as proof for the ecclesiastical tribunal that the marriage can not be rebuilt . In some countries , such as Italy , in which Catholic Church marriages are automatically transcribed to the civil records , a Church declaration of nullity may be granted the exequatur and treated as the equivalent of a civil divorce .
