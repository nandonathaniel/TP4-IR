The New Deal policies drew from many different ideas proposed earlier in the 20th century . Assistant Attorney General Thurman Arnold led efforts that hearkened back to an anti-monopoly tradition rooted in American politics by figures such as Andrew Jackson and Thomas Jefferson . Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis , an influential adviser to many New Dealers , argued that `` bigness '' ( referring , presumably , to corporations ) was a negative economic force , producing waste and inefficiency . However , the anti-monopoly group never had a major impact on New Deal policy . Other leaders such as Hugh S. Johnson of the NRA took ideas from the Woodrow Wilson Administration , advocating techniques used to mobilize the economy for World War I. They brought ideas and experience from the government controls and spending of 1917 -- 18 . Other New Deal planners revived experiments suggested in the 1920s , such as the TVA . The `` First New Deal '' ( 1933 -- 34 ) encompassed the proposals offered by a wide spectrum of groups . ( Not included was the Socialist Party , whose influence was all but destroyed . ) This first phase of the New Deal was also characterized by fiscal conservatism ( see Economy Act , below ) and experimentation with several different , sometimes contradictory , cures for economic ills .
