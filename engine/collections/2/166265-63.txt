The Atlanta Falcons franchise began on June 30 , 1965 , when NFL Commissioner Pete Rozelle granted ownership to 41 - year - old Rankin Smith Sr. Smith , an Executive Vice President of Life Insurance Company of Georgia at the time , paid $8.5 million the highest price in NFL history at the time for a franchise . Former commissioner Pete Rozelle and Smith made the deal in about five minutes and the Atlanta Falcons brought the largest and most popular sport to the city of Atlanta . The Atlanta expansion franchise became the 15th NFL franchise , and they were awarded the first pick in the 1966 NFL draft as well as the final pick in each of the first five rounds . The Falcons drafted All - American linebacker Tommy Nobis from the University of Texas with the first pick of the draft , making him the first - ever Falcon . The league also held the 1966 NFL Expansion Draft six weeks later in which the Falcons selected unprotected players from existing franchises . Although the Falcons selected many good players in those drafts , they still were not able to win right away .
