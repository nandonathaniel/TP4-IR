Following the deaths of Juan Bolsa and the Cousins , and Gus 's subsequent establishment of the superlab , Don Eladio orders retribution through his henchman Gaff , hijacking meth deliveries and killing some of Gus 's operatives . Gus agrees to Eladio 's demands -- the formula for the blue meth , the services of a chemist , and a 50 % share in the business -- and travels to the cartel 's superlab with Mike and Jesse . After Jesse cooks a successful batch , Eladio invites the three to a party at his villa attended by multiple capos of the cartel , toasting their new business venture with a bottle of premium tequila supplied by Gus , and chiding the latter for needing to be kept in line every twenty years . However , shortly afterwards the capos begin to collapse , victims of a poison Gus had put in the tequila . Eladio realizes that Gus ( who has vomited up some of the poisoned tequila then soon after is given an antidote after escaping to his prepared field hospital ) has betrayed him , but he collapses dead into the swimming pool before he can take any action .
