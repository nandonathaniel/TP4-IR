A new idea that is still at the early stages of development is that semantic memory , like perception , can be subdivided into types of visual information -- color , size , form , and motion . Thompson - Schill ( 2003 ) found that the left or bilateral ventral temporal cortex appears to be involved in retrieval of knowledge of color and form , the left lateral temporal cortex in knowledge of motion , and the parietal cortex in knowledge of size .
