The integration of former princely states with other provinces to form new states has also given rise to some issues . The Telangana region , comprising the Telugu - speaking districts of the former Hyderabad State , were in many ways different from the Telugu - speaking areas of British India with which they were merged . In recognition of these differences , the States Reorganisation Commission originally recommended that Telangana be created as a separate state , rather than as part of a broader Telugu - speaking entity . This recommendation was rejected by the Government of India , and Telangana was merged into Andhra Pradesh . The result was the emergence in the 1960s of a movement demanding a separate Telangana state . The demand has been accepted by the Union Government , leading to formation of Telangana as the 29th state of India in June 2014 . A similar movement , although less strong , exists in the Vidarbha region of Maharashtra , which consists of the former Nagpur state and the Berar region of the former Hyderabad state .
