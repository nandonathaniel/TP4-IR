The name `` applied behavior analysis '' has replaced behavior modification because the latter approach suggested attempting to change behavior without clarifying the relevant behavior - environment interactions . In contrast , ABA tries to change behavior by first assessing the functional relationship between a targeted behavior and the environment . Further , the approach often seeks to develop socially acceptable alternatives to aberrant behaviors .
