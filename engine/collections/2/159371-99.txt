Tsar Nicholas II and his subjects entered World War I with enthusiasm and patriotism , with the defense of Russia 's fellow Orthodox Slavs , the Serbs , as the main battle cry . In August 1914 , the Russian army invaded Germany 's province of East Prussia and occupied a significant portion of Austrian - controlled Galicia in support of the Serbs and their allies -- the French and British . In September 1914 , in order to relieve pressure on France , the Russians were forced to halt a successful offensive against Austro - Hungary in Galicia in order to attack German - held Silesia . Military reversals and shortages among the civilian population soon soured much of the population . German control of the Baltic Sea and German - Ottoman control of the Black Sea severed Russia from most of its foreign supplies and potential markets .
