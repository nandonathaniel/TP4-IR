The lawsuit was filed on April 22 , 2008 at the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington . It sought , among other things , an injunction to prevent the Sonics from being relocated from Seattle to Oklahoma City . The suit further requested that the franchise be placed in a constructive trust and no longer in the ownership of PBC . On May 20 , 2008 , Schultz 's attorney added alleged a breach of contract as a third cause of action against Bennett . Chicago - based attorney and ESPN senior writer Lester Munson said that while the remedies Schultz sought were `` without precedent in the sports industry '' , he did believe that both the Schultz case and Seattle 's lease case presented `` serious problems '' for Bennett .
