Doctor Bender ( voiced by Gilbert Gottfried in `` The Same Game '' , `` Scary GodParents '' , and `` Shiny Teeth '' ; Butch Hartman onwards ) is an evil dentist . He has an obsession with perfect teeth and is intolerant toward anyone who does not have quality teeth . He hates Timmy for his overbite . His son , Wendell ( also voiced by Gilbert Gottfried and later Butch Hartman ) , is almost identical to his father in appearance and is also tooth - hygienic , but hates it when his father scares off other kids . Doctor Bender enjoys performing pointless procedures on children 's teeth and encourages children to eat refined sugar to boost his business .
