Some variability also exists at the previous step -- the conversion of 2 - oxoglutarate to succinyl - CoA . While most organisms utilize the ubiquitous NAD - dependent 2 - oxoglutarate dehydrogenase , some bacteria utilize a ferredoxin - dependent 2 - oxoglutarate synthase ( EC 1.2. 7.3 ) . Other organisms , including obligately autotrophic and methanotrophic bacteria and archaea , bypass succinyl - CoA entirely , and convert 2 - oxoglutarate to succinate via succinate semialdehyde , using EC 4.1. 1.71 , 2 - oxoglutarate decarboxylase , and EC 1.2. 1.79 , succinate - semialdehyde dehydrogenase .
