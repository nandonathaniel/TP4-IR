Truman was brought up in the Presbyterian and Baptist churches , but avoided revivals and sometimes ridiculed revivalist preachers . He rarely spoke about religion , which to him , primarily meant ethical behavior along traditional Protestant lines . Most of the soldiers he commanded in the war were Catholics , and one of his close friends was the 129th Field Artillery 's chaplain , Monsignor L. Curtis Tiernan . Tiernan remained friendly with Truman until his death in 1960 , and served as chief chaplain in the European Theater during World War II . Developing leadership and interpersonal skills that later made him a successful politician helped Truman get along with his Catholic soldiers , as he did with soldiers of other Christian denominations and the unit 's Jewish members .
