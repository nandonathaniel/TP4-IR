The album 's main songwriters include band members Tom Fletcher and Danny Jones , as well as contributions from James Bourne from the band Busted , as well as some of Busted 's main producers . The album is directly influenced by three things : modern pop punk , 1960s surfer pop , and tales of unrequited love . The track `` Get Over You '' is hidden , and does not appear on the track listing . It can be accessed by rewinding into the pre-gap , prior to the first track , `` Five Colours in Her Hair '' . The track can not be accessed if the album is played in a computer . Four singles were released from the album : `` Five Colours in Her Hair '' and `` Obviously '' , which both went to number one , `` That Girl '' , which reached number three , and the title track , `` Room on the Third Floor '' , which peaked at five . A demo version of the track `` Saturday Night '' was previously released as `` Saturday Nite '' on the B - side of the `` Five Colours in Her Hair '' single . The international version of the album removes the songs `` Broccoli '' and `` Surfer Babe '' for contractual reasons . This version also features alternate artwork - the colour of the band logo is altered from yellow to red .
