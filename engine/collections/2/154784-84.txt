Janet Maslin of The New York Times criticized the film for shortchanging viewers on more details about Jake and Elwood 's affinity for African - American culture . She also took director Landis to task for `` distracting editing '' , mentioning the Soul Food diner scene in which saxophonist Lou Marini 's head is out of shot as he dances on the counter . In the documentary , Stories Behind the Making of The Blues Brothers , Landis acknowledges the criticism , and Marini recalls the dismay he felt at seeing the completed film .
