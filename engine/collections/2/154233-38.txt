Noise : Noise is any external interference during this communication process . Any external factors that creates unplanned distortion . This distortion can make it difficult for the receiver to interpret or assign meaning to a message as it was intended by the source . Examples of noise in the encoding of the message could be lack of radio or television signal . Noise can also occur when the sender and receivers fields of experience do not overlap , if there is no common ground between them , which may result in a misunderstanding in the meaning of the message . Throughout the communication process , the message is subject to irrelevant factors that can distort or interfere with its reception . Noise is the physical or Psychological fundamentals either from inside or outside of the process of communication . Noise acts as a barrier as it makes the message less accurate , less productive and unclear . It may even prevent the message from ever reaching the receiver . Physical noise is often triggered by badly made images or messages ( e.g. poor print quality ) or elements of distraction ( e.g. consumer scrolling through TV advertisements ) . Psychological noise could be mixed meanings , poor credibility of source or the insignificance of the message to the consumer requirements . Not having a connection with the receiver and lacking in common ground usually cause this . This may result in unsuitable encoding of the message such as ; using a sign , symbol , or word that is unfamiliar or has different meaning to the receiver ( e.g. sending a message in foreign language that is not understood by the receiver ) . The more common ground there is between the sender and the receiver , the less likely it is for noise and barriers to interrupt a message .
