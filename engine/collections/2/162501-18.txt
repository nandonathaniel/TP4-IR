Jason X ( 2001 ) marked Kane Hodder 's last performance as Jason . The film starts off in 2010 ; Jason has returned after another unexplained resurrection . Captured by the U.S. government in 2008 , Jason is being experimented upon in a research facility , where it has been determined that he has regenerative capabilities and that cryonic suspension is the only possible solution to stop him , since numerous attempts to execute him have proved unsuccessful . Jason escapes , killing all but one of his captors , and slices through the cryo - chamber , spilling cryonics fluid into the room , freezing himself and the only other survivor , Rowan ( Lexa Doig ) . A team of students 445 years later discover Jason 's body . On the team 's spacecraft , Jason thaws from his cryonic suspension and begins killing the crew . Along the way , he is enhanced by a regenerative nanotechnology process , which gives him an impenetrable metal body . Finally , he is ejected into space and falls to the planet Earth Two , burning in the atmosphere .
