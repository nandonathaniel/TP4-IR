The S5 includes a 16 megapixel rear - facing camera , which offers 4K video recording , phase detection autofocus ( which can focus in around 0.3 seconds ) , real - time HDR photos and video , and an image sensor with Samsung 's `` Isocell '' technology , which isolates the individual pixels inside the sensor to improve its ability to capture light and reduce crosstalk . Compared to conventional BSI sensors , this reduces electrical crosstalk by about 30 percent . Next to the camera 's flash on the rear of the device is a heart rate sensor , which can be used as part of the S Health software . The top of the device has an IR blaster and headphone jack . The IR blaster is a transmitter only and it has a built - in database of devices that can be controlled by Samsung 's Smart Remote application .
