The number 42 was officially retired by Major League Baseball in 1997 , but Mo Vaughn was one of a handful of players to continue wearing # 42 through a grandfather clause . He last wore it for the team in 1998 . In commemoration of Jackie Robinson Day , MLB invited players to wear the number 42 for games played on April 15 , Coco Crisp ( CF ) , David Ortiz ( DH ) , and DeMarlo Hale ( Coach ) did that in 2007 and again in 2008 . Starting in 2009 , MLB had all uniformed players for all teams wear # 42 for Jackie Robinson Day .
