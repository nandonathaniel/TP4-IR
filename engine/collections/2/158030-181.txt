Merchants complained that some railroad rates were too high . In the 1906 Hepburn Act , Roosevelt sought to give the Interstate Commerce Commission the power to regulate rates , but the Senate , led by conservative Nelson Aldrich fought back . Roosevelt worked with the Democratic Senator Benjamin Tillman to pass the bill . Roosevelt and Aldrich ultimately reached a compromise that gave the ICC the power to replace existing rates with `` just - and - reasonable '' maximum rates , but allowed railroads to appeal to the federal courts on what was `` reasonable . '' In addition to rate - setting , the Hepburn Act also granted the ICC regulatory power over pipeline fees , storage contracts , and several other aspects of railroad operations .
