The legal foundation for municipal governments in the country was laid with the promulgation of the Maura Law on May 19 , 1893 . Named after its author , Don Antonio Maura , the Spanish Minister of Colonies at the time , the law reorganized town governments in the Philippines with the aim of making them more effective and autonomous . This law created the municipal organization that was later adopted , revised , and further strengthened by the American and Filippino governments that succeeded Spanish .
