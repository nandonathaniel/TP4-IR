Note : While the U.S. Navy is older than the Marine Corps , the Marine Corps takes precedence due to previous inconsistencies in the Navy 's birth date . The Marine Corps has recognized its observed birth date on a more consistent basis . The Second Continental Congress is considered to have established the Navy on 13 October 1775 by authorizing the purchase of ships , but did not actually pass the `` Rules for the Regulation of the Navy of the United Colonies '' until 27 November 1775 . The Marine Corps was established by act of said Congress on 10 November 1775 . The Navy did not officially recognize 13 October 1775 as its birth date until 1972 , when then -- Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Elmo Zumwalt authorized it to be observed as such .
