The city was connected with Istanbul in 1944 by a railway line . This was the major transportation route until the 1950s when highways gradually became more important . Until the 1950s , Batman was a village of some 3,000 people ; it was called Iluh and belonged to the Siirt Province . It was first located in the Elmedin district of Siirt . The entire district disappeared in the early 1926 due to the flood of the Batman River . After that , Iluh became part of Be≈üiri sub-province . On 2 September 1957 , the village became a district center and renamed Batman after the river flowing nearby , which was known under its modern name since at least the 19th century . On 16 May 1990 it was designated the capital of the Batman Province .
