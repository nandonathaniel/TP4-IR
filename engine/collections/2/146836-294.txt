A controlled deorbit into a remote ocean was found to be technically feasible only with Russia 's assistance . The Russian Space Agency has experience from de-orbiting the Salyut 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 and Mir space stations ; NASA 's first intentional controlled de-orbit of a satellite ( the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory ) occurred in 2000 . As of late 2010 , the preferred plan is to use a slightly modified Progress spacecraft to de-orbit the ISS . This plan was seen as the simplest , cheapest and with the highest margin . Skylab , the only space station built and launched entirely by the US , decayed from orbit slowly over 5 years , and no attempt was made to de-orbit it using a deorbital burn . Remains of Skylab hit populated areas of Esperance , Western Australia without injuries or loss of life .
