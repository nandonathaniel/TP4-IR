The pound - force has a metric counterpart , less commonly used than the newton : the kilogram - force ( kgf ) ( sometimes kilopond ) , is the force exerted by standard gravity on one kilogram of mass . The kilogram - force leads to an alternate , but rarely used unit of mass : the metric slug ( sometimes mug or hyl ) is that mass that accelerates at 1 m s when subjected to a force of 1 kgf . The kilogram - force is not a part of the modern SI system , and is generally deprecated ; however it still sees use for some purposes as expressing aircraft weight , jet thrust , bicycle spoke tension , torque wrench settings and engine output torque . Other arcane units of force include the sth√®ne , which is equivalent to 1000 N , and the kip , which is equivalent to 1000 lbf .
