Since the mid-19th century , eclecticism , in which there is no a priori bias to a single manuscript , has been the dominant method of editing the Greek text of the New Testament . This is reflected in the Novum Testamentum Graece , which since 2014 corresponds to both the United Bible Society , 5th edition and Nestle - Aland , 28th edition . In textual criticism , eclecticism is the practice of examining a wide number of text witnesses and selecting the variant that seems best . The result of the process is a text with readings drawn from many witnesses . In a purely eclectic approach , no single witness is theoretically favored . Instead , the critic forms opinions about individual witnesses , relying on both external and internal evidence . Even so , the oldest manuscripts , being of the Alexandrian text - type , are the most favored , and the critical text has an Alexandrian disposition . Modern translations of the New Testament are based on these copies .
