In 1842 , the Qing authorities sued for peace , which concluded with the Treaty of Nanjing signed on a gunboat in the river , negotiated in August of that year and ratified in 1843 . In the treaty , China was forced to pay an indemnity to Britain , open five ports to Britain , and cede Hong Kong to Queen Victoria . In the supplementary Treaty of the Bogue , the Qing empire also recognized Britain as an equal to China and gave British subjects extraterritorial privileges in treaty ports .
