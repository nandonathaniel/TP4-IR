In the outer Solar System , comets remain frozen and inactive and are extremely difficult or impossible to detect from Earth due to their small size . Statistical detections of inactive comet nuclei in the Kuiper belt have been reported from observations by the Hubble Space Telescope but these detections have been questioned . As a comet approaches the inner Solar System , solar radiation causes the volatile materials within the comet to vaporize and stream out of the nucleus , carrying dust away with them .
