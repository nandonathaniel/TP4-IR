The IIF was able to invest in development projects due to Disston 's purchase , and an opportunity to improve transportation arose when oil tycoon Henry Flagler began purchasing land and building rail lines along the east coast of Florida , as far south as Palm Beach in 1893 . Along the way he built resort hotels , transforming territorial outposts into tourist destinations . The land bordering the rail lines was developed as citrus farms . By 1896 the rail line had been extended to Biscayne Bay . Three months after the first train had arrived , the residents of Miami voted to incorporate the town . Miami became a prime destination for extremely wealthy people after the Royal Palm Hotel was opened .
