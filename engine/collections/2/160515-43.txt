For the next century , through the reigns of James I , who ordered the creation of what became known as the King James Bible , and Charles I , culminating in the English Civil War and the Protectorate of Oliver Cromwell , there were significant swings back and forth between two factions : the Puritans ( and other radicals ) who sought more far - reaching Protestant reforms , and the more conservative churchmen who aimed to keep closer to traditional beliefs and Catholic practices . The failure of political and ecclesiastical authorities to submit to Puritan demands for more extensive reform was one of the causes of open warfare . By Continental standards , the level of violence over religion was not high , but the casualties included King Charles I and the Archbishop of Canterbury , William Laud . Under the Commonwealth and the Protectorate of England from 1649 to 1660 , the bishops were dethroned and former practices were outlawed , and Presbyterian ecclesiology was introduced in place of the episcopate . The 39 Articles were replaced by the Westminster Confession , the Book of Common Prayer by the Directory of Public Worship . Despite this , about one quarter of English clergy refused to conform to this form of State Presbyterianism .
