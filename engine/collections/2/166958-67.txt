Following the December 1 , 2011 , vote by the United States Senate to reject an NDAA amendment proscribing the indefinite detention of U.S. citizens , the ACLU has argued that the legitimacy of Habeas Corpus is threatened : `` The Senate voted 38 - 60 to reject an important amendment ( that ) would have removed harmful provisions authorizing the U.S. military to pick up and imprison without charge or trial civilians , including American citizens , anywhere in the world ... We 're disappointed that , despite robust opposition to the harmful detention legislation from virtually the entire national security leadership of the government , the Senate said ' no ' to the Udall amendment and ' yes ' to indefinite detention without charge or trial . '' The New York Times has stated that the vote leaves the constitutional rights of U.S. citizens `` ambiguous , '' with some senators including Carl Levin and Lindsey Graham arguing that the Supreme Court had already approved holding Americans as enemy combatants , and other senators , including Dianne Feinstein and Richard Durbin , asserting the opposite .
