Under Canadian law , a person has the constitutional right to a jury trial for all crimes punishable by five years of imprisonment or more . The Criminal Code also provides for the right to a jury trial for most indictable offences , including those punishable by less than five years imprisonment , though the right is only constitutionally enshrined for those offences punishable by five years imprisonment or more . Generally , it is the accused person who is entitled to elect whether their trial will proceed by judge alone or by judge and jury ; however , for the most severe criminal offences -- murder , treason , alarming Her Majesty , intimidating Parliament , inciting to mutiny , sedition , and piracy -- trial by jury is mandatory unless the prosecution consents to trial by judge alone .
