Some secondary schools still use the ' form ' system , with Year 7 being 1st Form ( or `` 1st year '' ) , Year 8 being Second Form , et cetera , up until Year 12 and Year 13 , which together make up the 6th Form ( namely lower and upper sixth form ) . Some independent schools use other naming systems .
