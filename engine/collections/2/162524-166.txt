The Orthodox Church , in understanding itself to be the Body of Christ , and similarly in understanding the Christian life to lead to the unification in Christ of all members of his body , views the church as embracing all Christ 's members , those now living on earth , and also all those through the ages who have passed on to the heavenly life . The church includes the Christian saints from all times , and also judges , prophets and righteous Jews of the first covenant , Adam and Eve , even the angels and heavenly hosts . In Orthodox services , the earthly members together with the heavenly members worship God as one community in Christ , in a union that transcends time and space and joins heaven to earth . This unity of the Church is sometimes called the communion of the saints .
