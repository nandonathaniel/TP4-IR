Oakland 's 2002 campaign began on a tumultuous note . During the 2001 -- 02 offseason , the team lost three key free agents to larger market teams : 2000 AL MVP Jason Giambi to the New York Yankees , outfielder Johnny Damon to the Boston Red Sox , and closer Jason Isringhausen to the St. Louis Cardinals . Faced with a number of significant roster holes , general manager Billy Beane sought to replace Damon and Giambi with free agent hitters Scott Hatteberg , David Justice , and Ray Durham ( among others ) . Beane also made a number of key pitching acquisitions ; most notably , he traded for Toronto Blue Jays reliever Billy Koch . Koch ultimately succeeded Isringhausen as the team 's closer . Beane also traded for then - unheralded starter Ted Lilly . Additionally , the season saw the MLB debuts of second baseman Mark Ellis and eventual starter Aaron Harang .
