In reviewing L'Enfant's plan , Thomas Jefferson insisted the legislative building be called the `` Capitol '' rather than `` Congress House '' . The word `` Capitol '' comes from Latin and is associated with the Temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus on Capitoline Hill , one of the seven hills of Rome . The connection between the two is not , however , crystal clear . In addition to coming up with a city plan , L'Enfant had been tasked with designing the Capitol and President 's House ; however , he was dismissed in February 1792 over disagreements with President George Washington and the commissioners , and there were no plans at that point for the Capitol .
