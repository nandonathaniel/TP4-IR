The Charter 's unifying purpose was particularly important to the mobility and language rights . According to author Rand Dyck , some scholars believe section 23 , with its minority language education rights , `` was the only part of the Charter with which Pierre Trudeau was truly concerned '' . Through the mobility and language rights , French Canadians , who have been at the centre of unity debates , are able to travel throughout all Canada and receive government and educational services in their own language . Hence , they are not confined to Quebec ( the only province where they form the majority and where most of their population is based ) , which would polarize the country along regional lines . The Charter was also supposed to standardize previously diverse laws throughout the country and gear them towards a single principle of liberty .
