At the end of `` The Star - Spangled Banner '' before home games , many Chiefs fans intentionally yell out `` CHIEFS ! '' rather than singing `` brave '' as the final word . In 1996 , general manager Carl Peterson said `` We all look forward , not only at Arrowhead , but on the road , too , to when we get to that stanza of the National Anthem ... Our players love it . '' After the September 11 , 2001 attacks , Chiefs fans refrained from doing so in honor of those who lost their lives in the tragedy and continued to do so for the remainder of the 2001 season . At the Chiefs ' September 23 , 2001 , home game against the New York Giants , fans gave the opposing Giants a standing ovation .
