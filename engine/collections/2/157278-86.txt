Thomistic scholasticism in the English speaking world went into decline in the 1970s when the Thomistic revival that had been spearheaded by Jacques Maritain , Ã‰tienne Gilson , and others , diminished in influence . Partly , this was because this branch of Thomism had become a quest to understand the historical Aquinas after the Second Vatican Council . Still , those who had learned Scholastic philosophy continued to have unresolved questions about how the insights of the medieval synthesis could be applied to contemporary problems . This conversation departed from the academic environment and entered internet discussion groups such as Aquinas , Christian Philosophy , and Thomism , and websites such as Open Philosophy , where it continues today .
