In 1641 , Fr Sebasti√°n de Oquendo , OP , the Prior of Santo Domingo monastery in Intramuros , decided to send to San Juan the image of the Santo Cristo that was then venerated in Binondo Church ( another Dominican possession ) . The venerable image was brought to the reconstructed church in San Juan and placed on the main altar , displacing the image of John the Baptist , since the image , which was `` nine palmos in height '' ( approx . 1.80 metres ) would not fit . From then on , devotion to the Santo Cristo spread to nearby communities . The shrine itself gained popularity when the image began to perform miracles , thus earning the shrine the name Santuario del Santo Cristo . News of the image 's miracles spread to Manila and the surrounding areas , particularly the neighbouring Franciscan parish and town of Santa Ana , to which the present - day San Juan Mandaluyong once belonged to .
