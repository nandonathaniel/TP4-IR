When the war began , the US Post Office still delivered mail from the secessionist states for a brief period of time . Mail that was postmarked after the date of a state 's admission into the Confederacy through May 31 , 1861 , and bearing US postage was still delivered . After this time , private express companies still managed to carry some of the mail across enemy lines . Later , mail that crossed lines had to be sent by ' Flag of Truce ' and was allowed to pass at only two specific points . Mail sent from the South to the North states was received , opened and inspected at Fortress Monroe on the Virginia coast before being passed on into the U.S. mail stream . Mail sent from the North to the South passed at City Point , also in Virginia , where it was also inspected before being sent on .
