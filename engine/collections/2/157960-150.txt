In the European Middle Ages goldsmiths used engraving to decorate and inscribe metalwork . It is thought that they began to print impressions of their designs to record them . From this grew the engraving of copper printing plates to produce artistic images on paper , known as old master prints in Germany in the 1430s . Italy soon followed . Many early engravers came from a goldsmithing background . The first and greatest period of the engraving was from about 1470 to 1530 , with such masters as Martin Schongauer , Albrecht DÃ¼rer , and Lucas van Leiden .
