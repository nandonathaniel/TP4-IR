During the brief period when the U.S. Supreme Court was deliberating on Bush v. Gore , the Florida Supreme Court provided clarifications that the U.S. Supreme Court had requested on December 4 in the case of Bush v. Palm Beach County Canvassing Board . Because of the extraordinary nature and argued urgency of the case , the U.S. Supreme Court issued its opinion in Bush v. Gore on December 12 , 2000 , less than a day after hearing oral argument .
