In May 1998 , in a protest by 2000 ex-PoWs , a Burma Railway veteran torched the Rising Sun banner before both Emperor Akihito and Queen Elizabeth . Police were moved by the crowd not to arrest him . A year later , two `` committed socialists '' threw a burning Union flag in the direction of the Queen 's motor vehicle . They were arrested for breach of the peace , subsequently pleaded guilty and were fined a total Â£ 450 . In 2001 at RAF Feltwell , home of United States Air Force 's 5th Space Surveillance Squadron , a protester defaced the US Flag with the words `` Stop Star Wars '' before stepping in front of a vehicle and stamping on the flag . Her conviction under S5 Public Order Act 1986 , was overturned as incompatible with Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights .
