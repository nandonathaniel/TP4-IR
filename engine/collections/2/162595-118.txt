SONET / SDH development was originally driven by the need to transport multiple PDH signals -- like DS1 , E1 , DS3 , and E3 -- along with other groups of multiplexed 64 kbit / s pulse - code modulated voice traffic . The ability to transport ATM traffic was another early application . In order to support large ATM bandwidths , concatenation was developed , whereby smaller multiplexing containers ( e.g. , STS - 1 ) are inversely multiplexed to build up a larger container ( e.g. , STS - 3c ) to support large data - oriented pipes .
