Two free states were proposed by Zachary Taylor , who served as President from March 1849 to July 1850 . As President , he proposed that the entire area become two free states , called California and New Mexico but much larger than the ones today . None of the area would be left as an unorganized or organized territory , which would avoid the question of slavery in the territories .
