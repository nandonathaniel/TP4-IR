Throughout the 1980s and 1990s the institutions of Catalan autonomy continued to develop , among them an autonomous police force ( called Mossos d'Esquadra , officially refunded as the police of Catalonia in 1983 ) , the restoration of the comarcal administrations ( roughly equivalent to United States `` counties '' or United Kingdom `` shires '' or `` counties '' , but distinct from the historical Catalan counties ) and a High Court in the form of the High Court of Justice of Catalonia ( Catalan : Tribunal Superior de Just√≠cia de Catalunya ) .
