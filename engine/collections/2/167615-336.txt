Mao Zedong 's decision to take on the United States in the Korean War was a direct attempt to confront what the Communist bloc viewed as the strongest anti-Communist power in the world , undertaken at a time when the Chinese Communist regime was still consolidating its own power after winning the Chinese Civil War . Mao supported intervention not to save North Korea , but because he believed that a military conflict with the United States was inevitable after the United States entered the Korean War , and to appease the Soviet Union to secure military dispensation and achieve Mao 's goal of making China a major world military power . Mao was equally ambitious in improving his own prestige inside the communist international community by demonstrating that his Marxist concerns were international . In his later years Mao believed that Stalin only gained a positive opinion of him after China 's entrance into the Korean War . Inside mainland China , the war improved the long - term prestige of Mao , Zhou , and Peng , allowing the Chinese Communist Party to increase its legitimacy while weakening anti-Communist dissent .
