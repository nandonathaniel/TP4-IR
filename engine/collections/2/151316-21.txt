The rackets have changed in a similar way to those used in tennis . Squash rackets used to be made out of laminated timber . In the 1980s , construction shifted to lighter materials ( such as aluminium and graphite ) with small additions of components like Kevlar , boron and titanium . Natural `` gut '' strings were also replaced with synthetic strings .
