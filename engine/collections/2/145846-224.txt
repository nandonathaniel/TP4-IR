Vocational high schools come in two varieties : the dual and in school - based programme . For the former , the apprenticeship is provided by employers , while the practical training for the latter is offered in school . Both of them complete with a final examination . Students may continue their education in the two - year vocational - technical programme ( colloquially known as 3 + 2 programme ) , which prepares them for vocational leaving exam if they want to pursue higher education .
