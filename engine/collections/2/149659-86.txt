The most reliable method for assessing pain in most humans is by asking a question : a person may report pain that can not be detected by any known physiological measure . However , like infants , animals can not answer questions about whether they feel pain ; thus the defining criterion for pain in humans can not be applied to them . Philosophers and scientists have responded to this difficulty in a variety of ways . Ren√© Descartes for example argued that animals lack consciousness and therefore do not experience pain and suffering in the way that humans do . Bernard Rollin of Colorado State University , the principal author of two U.S. federal laws regulating pain relief for animals , writes that researchers remained unsure into the 1980s as to whether animals experience pain , and that veterinarians trained in the U.S. before 1989 were simply taught to ignore animal pain . In his interactions with scientists and other veterinarians , he was regularly asked to `` prove '' that animals are conscious , and to provide `` scientifically acceptable '' grounds for claiming that they feel pain . Carbone writes that the view that animals feel pain differently is now a minority view . Academic reviews of the topic are more equivocal , noting that although the argument that animals have at least simple conscious thoughts and feelings has strong support , some critics continue to question how reliably animal mental states can be determined . The ability of invertebrate species of animals , such as insects , to feel pain and suffering is also unclear .
