The period after the Second World War saw a flowering of scholarship on Austen as well as a diversity of critical approaches . One school that emerged in the United States was the New Criticism , which saw literary texts in only aesthetic terms , an object of beauty to be appreciated in and of itself without any study of the individual that had produced it or the society that she lived in . The New Critics tended to praise Austen for her literacy skills at combining irony and paradox , but other critics argued that the New Criticism by only focusing on the aesthetic qualities of the books ignored the message of the books and Austen herself , who was reduced down to merely being the scribe who produced these books that they admired so much . More typical of the post-1945 scholarship is Marvin Mudrick 's 1952 book Jane Austen : Irony as Defense and Discovery , where he argued that Austen used irony as a way of deflating conventions and to gently challenge the reader 's beliefs .
