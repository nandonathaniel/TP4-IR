Karen Allen , who previously appeared in Raiders of the Lost Ark , reprises the role of Marion Ravenwood ( under the married name of Marion Williams ) . Frank Darabont 's script introduced the idea of Marion returning as Indiana 's love interest . Allen was not aware her character was in the script until Spielberg called her in January 2007 , saying , `` It 's been announced ! We 're gon na make Indiana Jones 4 ! And guess what ? You 're in it ! '' Ford found Allen `` one of the easiest people to work with ( he 's ) ever known . She 's a completely self - sufficient woman , and that 's part of the character she plays . A lot of her charm and the charm of the character is there . And again , it 's not an age - dependent thing . It has to do with her spirit and her nature . '' Allen found Ford easier to work with on this film , than in Raiders .
