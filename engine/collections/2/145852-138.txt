Magna Carta became increasingly embedded into English political life during Henry III 's minority . As the King grew older , his government slowly began to recover from the civil war , regaining control of the counties and beginning to raise revenue once again , taking care not to overstep the terms of the charters . Henry remained a minor and his government 's legal ability to make permanently binding decisions on his behalf was limited . In 1223 , the tensions over the status of the charters became clear in the royal court , when Henry 's government attempted to reassert its rights over its properties and revenues in the counties , facing resistance from many communities that argued -- if sometimes incorrectly -- that the charters protected the new arrangements . This resistance resulted in an argument between Archbishop Langton and William Brewer over whether the King had any duty to fulfil the terms of the charters , given that he had been forced to agree to them . On this occasion , Henry gave oral assurances that he considered himself bound by the charters , enabling a royal inquiry into the situation in the counties to progress .
