Of the critical issues facing the nation , few are more compelling than improving the academic performance of public schools and ensuring a stable , safe and affordable food supply . Today agricultural education is positioned to contribute substantially in these arenas through a major national initiative . Under the direction of The National Council for Agricultural Education , the `` 10x15 Long Range Goal for Agricultural Education '' employs a comprehensive strategy engaging eight high - priority initiatives . The focus of the unprecedented effort is twofold : create new programs in communities not yet served by agricultural education and FFA , and ensure the quality and high performance of current programs providing personal , academic and career education in agriculture . While the goal of `` 10x15 '' is to grow the number of agricultural education programs from 7,200 to 10,000 by the year 2015 , the clear emphasis is on quality .
