Catholic fortunes fluctuated in Maryland during the rest of the 17th century , as they became an increasingly smaller minority of the population . After the Glorious Revolution of 1689 in England , the Church of England was legally established in the colony and English penal laws , which deprived Catholics of the right to vote , hold office , or worship publicly , were enforced . Maryland 's first state constitution in 1776 restored the freedom of religion .
