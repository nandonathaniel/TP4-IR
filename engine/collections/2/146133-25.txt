Although the Dutch colonizers initially were motivated by the prospect of trade in the Caribbean , their possessions became significant producers of crops . The growing importance of agriculture was indicated by the export of 15,000 kilograms of tobacco from Essequibo in 1623 . But as the agricultural productivity of the Dutch colonies increased , a labor shortage emerged . The indigenous populations were poorly adapted for work on plantations , and many people died from diseases introduced by the Europeans . The Dutch West India Company turned to the importation of enslaved African s , who rapidly became a key element in the colonial economy . By the 1660s , the enslaved population numbered about 2,500 ; the number of indigenous people was estimated at 50,000 , most of whom had retreated into the vast hinterland . Although enslaved Africans were considered an essential element of the colonial economy , their working conditions were brutal . The mortality rate was high , and the dismal conditions led to more than half a dozen rebellions led by the enslaved Africans .
