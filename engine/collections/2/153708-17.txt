In the pilot episode ( `` Mexican Slayride : Part 1 '' ) , Hannibal is described by a reporter colleague of Amy Allen as follows : `` The leader ( of the A-Team ) is a Colonel named John Smith . But everybody calls him Hannibal . The guy has a very unorthodox style . '' Smith takes his name from the famous military commander and strategist , as alluded to by B.A. Baracus in the same episode ; various items of tie - in literature for the series commented that just as the original Hannibal had led the elephants over the alps , this Hannibal had led his men over the wall of Fort Bragg after they were wrongly arrested . He is distinguished by his unflappable demeanor , even when in peril , his constant cigar - smoking , his black leather gloves , and his many disguises . He is a master tactician ( although his plans rarely turn out as they are supposed to ; when asked if she thought this was going to work , Amy Allen summed it up by saying , `` Hannibal 's plans never work right . They just work . '' ) and seems to have a plan for getting the team out of any situation they get into . His favorite catchphrase is , `` I love it when a plan comes together '' ; he is often heard to remark `` Nice '' after part of his plan has succeeded - sometimes with destructive or explosive results .
