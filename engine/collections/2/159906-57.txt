French buccaneers established a settlement on the island of Tortuga in 1625 before going to Grande Terre ( mainland ) . At first they survived by pirating Spanish ships , eating wild cattle and hogs , and selling hides to traders of all nations . Although the Spanish destroyed the buccaneers ' settlements several times , on each occasion they returned due to an abundance of natural resources : hardwood trees , wild hogs and cattle , and fresh water . The settlement on Tortuga was officially established in 1659 under the commission of King Louis XIV .
