Grograman is the first creature Bastian meets upon his arrival in Fantastica ( if the Childlike Empress is to be excluded ) ; Bastian is protected from the effect of Grograman 's death aura by AURYN , and is thus the first living being ever to make friends with him . Grograman is the first one who teaches Bastian something of the nature of Fantastica , and he gives Bastian his magic ( and seemingly intelligent ) sword , Sikanda . One night , Bastian is called away ; he promises to return , but is ultimately unable to keep his promise ( the story states , however , that one day someone would fulfill the promise in Bastian 's name ) .
