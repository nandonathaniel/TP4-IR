Science - fiction novels make liberal use of a futuristic Thames . The utopian News from Nowhere by William Morris is mainly the account of a journey through the Thames valley in a socialist future . The Thames also features prominently in Philip Pullman 's His Dark Materials trilogy , as a communications artery for the waterborne Gyptian people of Oxford and the Fens , and as a prominent setting for his novel La Belle Sauvage .
