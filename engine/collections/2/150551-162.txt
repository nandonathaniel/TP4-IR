In a federation , the division of power between federal and regional governments is usually outlined in the constitution . Almost every country allows some degree of regional self - government , in federations the right to self - government of the component states is constitutionally entrenched . Component states often also possess their own constitutions which they may amend as they see fit , although in the event of conflict the federal constitution usually takes precedence .
