The development of large artillery pieces and larger guns began with Burgundy . Originally a minor power , it grew to become one of the most powerful states in 14th - century Europe , and a great innovator in siege warfare . The Duke of Burgundy , Philip the Bold ( 1363 - 1404 ) , based his power on the effective use of big guns and promoted research and development in all aspects of gunpowder weaponry technology . Philip established manufacturers and employed more cannon casters than any European power before him , however he was n't the first to build large guns . The first appeared in 1375 when a dozen or so smiths in Caen developed a 900 kilogram cannon which took six weeks to create . Whereas most European guns before 1370 weighed about 20 to 40 lbs ( 9 -- 14 kg ) , the French siege of Ch√¢teau de Saint - Sauveur - le - Vicomte in 1375 during the Hundred Years War saw the use of guns weighing over a ton ( 900 kg ) , firing stone balls weighing over 100 lbs ( 45 kg ) . Philip used large guns to help the French capture the fortress of Odruik in 1377 , which was held by the English at the time . These guns fired projectiles far larger than any that had been used before , and among the 140 cannons Philip brought to Odruik , 109 were large , with seven guns that could shoot projectiles as heavy as 90 kilograms . The cannons smashed the city walls , some going right through them , and Odruik surrendered , inaugurating a new era of artillery warfare . Burgundy 's territories rapidly expanded using their new gun designs .
