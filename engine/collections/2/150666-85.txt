Subsequent to the railhead 's meeting at Promontory Summit , U.T. , the San Joaquin River Bridge at Mossdale Crossing ( near present - day Lathrop , California ) was completed on September 8 , 1869 . As a result , the western part of the route was extended from Sacramento to the Alameda Terminal in Alameda , California , and shortly thereafter , to the Oakland Long Wharf at Oakland Point in Oakland , California , and on to San Jose , California . Train ferries transferred some railroad cars to and from the Oakland wharves and tracks to wharves and tracks in San Francisco . Before the CPRR was completed , developers were building other feeder railroads like the Virginia and Truckee Railroad to the Comstock Lode diggings in Virginia City , Nevada , and several different extensions in California and Nevada to reach other cities there . Some of their main cargo was the thousands of cords of firewood needed for the many steam engines and pumps , cooking stoves , heating stoves etc. in Comstock Lode towns and the tons of ice needed by the miners as they worked ever deeper into the `` hot '' Comstock Lode ore body . In the mines , temperatures could get above 120 ° F ( 49 ° C ) at the work face and a miner often used over 100 pounds ( 45 kg ) of ice per shift . This new railroad connected to the Central Pacific near Reno , and went through Carson City , the new capital of Nevada .
