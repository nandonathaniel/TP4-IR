According to writers including Gautam Kumar Bera , there was already a distinct geo - political , cultural entity called Jharkhand even before the Magadha Empire . Bera 's book ( page 33 ) also refers to the Hindu epic Bhavishya Purana . The tribal rulers , some of whom continue to thrive till today were known as the Munda Rajas , who basically had ownership rights to large farmlands . During the age of Mahajanpadas around 500 BC , India saw the emergence of 16 large states that controlled the entire Indian subcontinent . In those days the Jharkhand state was a part of Magadha , Anga , Banga , Kalinga , Kashi and Vajji .
