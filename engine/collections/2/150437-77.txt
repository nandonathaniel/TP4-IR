On October 7 , 2003 , the film was re-released on VHS and released on DVD for the first time , titled The Lion King : Platinum Edition , as part of Disney 's Platinum Edition line of animated classic DVDs . The DVD release featured two versions of the film on the first disc , a remastered version created for the 2002 IMAX release and an edited version of the IMAX release purporting to be the original 1994 theatrical version . A second disc , with bonus features , was also included in the DVD release . The film 's soundtrack was provided both in its original Dolby 5.1 track and in a new Disney Enhanced Home Theater Mix , making this one of the first Disney DVDs so equipped . By means of seamless branching , the film could be viewed either with or without a newly created scene -- a short conversation in the film replaced with a complete song ( `` The Morning Report '' ) . A Special Collector 's Gift Set was also released , containing the DVD set , five exclusive lithographed character portraits ( new sketches created and signed by the original character animators ) , and an introductory book entitled The Journey . The Platinum Edition of The Lion King featured changes made to the film during its IMAX re-release , including re-drawn crocodiles in the `` I Just Ca n't Wait to Be King '' sequence as well as other alterations . More than two million copies of the Platinum Edition DVD and VHS units were sold on the first day of release . A DVD boxed set of the three The Lion King films ( in two - disc Special Edition formats ) was released on December 6 , 2004 . In January 2005 , the film , along with the sequels , went back into moratorium .
