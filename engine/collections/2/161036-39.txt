A recent breakthrough for in vitro fertilization is the use of blastocysts . A blastocyst is implanted five to six days after the eggs have been fertilized . After five or six days it is much easier to determine which embryos will result in healthy live births . Knowing which embryos will succeed allows just one blastocyst to be implanted , cutting down dramatically on the health risk and expense of multiple births . Now that the nutrient requirements for embryonic and blastocyst development have been determined , it is much easier to give embryos the correct nutrients to sustain them into the blastocyst phase .
