Sima Qian relates that the dynasty itself was founded 13 generations later , when Xie 's descendant Tang overthrew the impious and cruel final Xia ruler in the Battle of Mingtiao . The Records recount events from the reigns of Tang , Tai Jia , Tai Wu , Pan Geng , Wu Ding , Wu Yi and the depraved final king Di Xin , but the rest of the Shang rulers are merely mentioned by name . According to the Records , the Shang moved their capital five times , with the final move to Yin in the reign of Pan Geng inaugurating the golden age of the dynasty .
