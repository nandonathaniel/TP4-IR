In 2012 , the new artistic director of the State Theater of Maryland , the Centerstage in Baltimore , chose to produce `` Gleam '' a.k.a. `` To Gleam It Around , To Show My Shine '' written by Bonnie Lee Moss Rattner . The play was directed by Marion McClinton . The production was enhanced by a grant of $55,000 from the National Endowment of the Arts . Writing in `` DC Theatre Scene , '' Debbie Jackson says `` Gleam hits a glorious stride at the Centerstage in Baltimore mainly because of the well - tuned script by Bonnie Lee Moss Rattner in the capable hands of director Marion McClinton . '' ( January 18 , 2012 ) Andrea Appleton writing in the `` Citypaper '' on 1 / 20 / 2012 , wrote a headline that states `` Gleam : A classic novel comes to breathtaking life . '' Donna Owen writing in Grio ( 1 / 18 / 2012 ) says GLEAM `` practically leaps off the stage with power , witty dialect , and poignancy . ''
