Characteristic X-ray emission ( X-ray fluorescence ) : If the electron has enough energy it can knock an orbital electron out of the inner electron shell of a metal atom , and as a result electrons from higher energy levels then fill up the vacancy and X-ray photons are emitted . This process produces an emission spectrum of X-rays at a few discrete frequencies , sometimes referred to as the spectral lines . The spectral lines generated depend on the target ( anode ) element used and thus are called characteristic lines . Usually these are transitions from upper shells into K shell ( called K lines ) , into L shell ( called L lines ) and so on .
