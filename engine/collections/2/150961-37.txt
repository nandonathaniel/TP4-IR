Most are of the Algonquian language family . Some tribes -- such as the Stockbridge - Munsee and the Brothertown -- are also Algonkian - speaking tribes who relocated from the eastern seaboard to the Great Lakes region in the 19th century . The Oneida belong to the Iroquois language group and the Ho - Chunk of Wisconsin are one of the few Great Lakes tribes to speak a Siouan language . American Indians in this area did not develop a written form of language .
