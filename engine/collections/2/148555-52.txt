Upon returning to India , Chand resumed his duties in the barracks . In December 1935 , the IHF decided to stage the Inter-Provincial tournament to select the Olympic team . Chand was again denied permission to leave his platoon , though once again he was selected without formalities . The final team assembled in Delhi on 16 June and played against the Delhi Hockey XI . Incredibly , they lost 4 - 1 . After this inauspicious start , the team went on a successful tour of the subcontinent , finally departing for Marseilles on 27 June . They arrived on 10 July , and after an uncomfortable journey in third - class compartments , reached Berlin on 13 July . On 17 July , the Indian team played a practice match against Germany and lost 4 - 1 . As such , manager Pankaj Gupta informed the IHF that Ali Dara had to be sent immediately to replace the out of form Mirza Masood .
