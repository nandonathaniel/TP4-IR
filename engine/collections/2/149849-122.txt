Sea turtle shells are an ideal habitat for adult barnacles for three reasons . Turtles tend to live long lives , around 50 years , so barnacles do not have to worry about host death . Secondly , barnacles are suspension feeders . Sea turtles spend most of their lives swimming and following ocean currents and as water runs along the back of the turtle 's shell it passes over the barnacles , providing an almost constant water flow and influx of food particles . Lastly , the long distances and inter-ocean travel these sea turtles swim throughout their lifetime offers the perfect mechanism for dispersal of barnacle larvae . Allowing the barnacle species to distribute themselves throughout global waters is a high fitness advantage of this commensalism .
