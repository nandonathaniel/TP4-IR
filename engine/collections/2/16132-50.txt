The stone used for West Campus has seven primary colors and seventeen shades of color . The university supervisor of planning and construction wrote that the stone has `` an older , more attractive antique effect '' and a `` warmer and softer coloring than the Princeton stone '' that gave the university an `` artistic look . '' James B. Duke initially suggested the use of stone from a quarry in Princeton , New Jersey , but later amended the plans to purchase a local quarry in Hillsborough to reduce costs . Duke Chapel stands at the center of West Campus on the highest ridge . Constructed from 1930 to 1935 , the chapel seats 1,600 people and , at 210 feet ( 64 m ) is one of the tallest buildings in Durham County .
