After Austin won the 1998 Royal Rumble , former boxing champion Mike Tyson made a guest appearance on Raw Is War the following night . Tyson , who at the time was still suspended from boxing , was to be introduced as the `` Special Guest Enforcer '' referee for the championship match at WrestleMania XIV . However , McMahon 's presentation of Tyson was interrupted by Austin , who flipped off Tyson , leading to a brief scuffle . Over the following weeks , Tyson aligned himself with Michaels , Austin 's opponent at WrestleMania , and D - Generation X .
