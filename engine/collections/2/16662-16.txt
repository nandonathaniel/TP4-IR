The draft Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination was adopted by the General Assembly on 20 November 1963 . The same day the General Assembly called for the Economic and Social Council and the Commission on Human Rights to make the drafting of a Convention on the subject an absolute priority . The draft was completed by mid-1964 , but delays in the General Assembly meant that it could not be adopted that year . It was finally adopted on 21 December 1965 .
