Trajan 's successor Hadrian adopted a policy of maintaining rather than expanding the empire . Borders ( fines ) were marked , and the frontiers ( limites ) patrolled . The most heavily fortified borders were the most unstable . Hadrian 's Wall , which separated the Roman world from what was perceived as an ever - present barbarian threat , is the primary surviving monument of this effort .
