As a result of the lack of space and demand for construction , few older buildings remain , and the city is becoming a centre for modern architecture . The International Commerce Centre ( ICC ) , at 484 m ( 1,588 ft ) high , is the tallest building in Hong Kong and the third tallest in the world , by height to roof measurement . The tallest building prior to the ICC is Two International Finance Centre , at 415 m ( 1,362 ft ) high . Other recognisable skyline features include the HSBC Headquarters Building , the triangular - topped Central Plaza with its pyramid - shaped spire , The Center with its night - time multi-coloured neon light show ; A Symphony of Lights and I.M. Pei 's Bank of China Tower with its sharp , angular fa√ßade . According to the Emporis website , the city skyline has the biggest visual impact of all world cities . Also , Hong Kong 's skyline is often regarded to be the best in the world , with the surrounding mountains and Victoria Harbour complementing the skyscrapers . Most of the oldest remaining historic structures , including the Tsim Sha Tsui Clock Tower , the Central Police Station , and the remains of Kowloon Walled City were constructed during the 19th and early 20th centuries .
