The 2008 prize was awarded to Osamu Shimomura , Martin Chalfie and Roger Y . Tsien for their work on green fluorescent protein or GFP . However , Douglas Prasher was the first to clone the GFP gene and suggested its use as a biological tracer . Martin Chalfie stated , `` Douglas Prasher 's work was critical and essential for the work we did in our lab . They could 've easily given the prize to Douglas and the other two and left me out . '' Prasher 's accomplishments were not recognized , and he eventually found himself out of a science career . When the Nobel was awarded in 2008 , Prasher was working as a courtesy shuttle bus driver in Huntsville , Alabama . Roger Tsien had advocated for Prasher from the beginning , even offering him a job when Prasher 's academic career stalled . Eventually , Prasher accepted the offer and moved in 2013 to UCSD to join Tsien 's lab .
