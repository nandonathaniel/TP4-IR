States of the United States are required , like the federal government , to be republican in form , with final authority resting with the people . This was required because the states were intended to create and enforce most domestic laws , with the exception of areas delegated to the federal government and prohibited to the states . The founding fathers of the country intended most domestic laws to be handled by the states . Requiring the states to be a republic in form was seen as protecting the citizens ' rights and preventing a state from becoming a dictatorship or monarchy , and reflected unwillingness on the part of the original 13 states ( all independent republics ) to unite with other states that were not republics . Additionally , this requirement ensured that only other republics could join the union .
