Under the Carolingians , the Frankish kingdom spread to encompass an area including most of Western Europe ; the east - west division of the kingdom formed the basis for modern France and Germany . Orman portrays the Treaty of Verdun ( 843 ) between the warring grandsons of Charlemagne as the foundation event of an independent France under its first king Charles the Bald ; an independent Germany under its first king Louis the German ; and an independent intermediate state stretching from the low countries along the borderlands to south of Rome under Lothair I , who retained the title of emperor and the capitals Aachen and Rome without the jurisdiction . The middle kingdom had broken up by 890 and partly absorbed into Western kingdom ( later France ) and Eastern kingdom ( Germany ) and the rest developing into smaller `` buffer '' nations that exist between France and Germany to this day , namely the Benelux and Switzerland . The concept and memory of a united Europe remains topical to the current time and hence Charlemagne is often considered the forefather of modern Europe .
