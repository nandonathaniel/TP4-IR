Author Robert R. Frump wrote in The Man - eaters of Eden that Mozambican refugees regularly crossing Kruger National Park at night in South Africa are attacked and eaten by the lions ; park officials have conceded that man - eating is a problem there . Frump believes thousands may have been killed in the decades after apartheid sealed the park and forced the refugees to cross the park at night . For nearly a century before the border was sealed , Mozambicans had regularly walked across the park in daytime with little harm .
