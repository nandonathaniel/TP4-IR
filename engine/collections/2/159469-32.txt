The Capitol building is surrounded by 22 acres ( 8.9 ha ) of grounds scattered with statues and monuments . William Munro Johnson , civil engineer , was hired in 1888 to improve the appearance of the grounds . By the time the first monument , commemorating the Heroes of the Alamo , was installed in 1891 , the major components of Johnson 's plan were in place . These included a `` Great Walk '' of black and white diamond - patterned pavement shaded by trees . The four oldest monuments are the Heroes of the Alamo ( 1891 ) , Volunteer Firemen ( 1896 ) , Confederate Soldiers ( 1903 ) and Terry 's Texas Rangers ( 1907 ) , and these flank the tree - lined Great Walk . In the spring of 2013 , ground was broken for the Texas Capitol Vietnam Veterans Monument ; dedication took place on March 29 , 2014 .
