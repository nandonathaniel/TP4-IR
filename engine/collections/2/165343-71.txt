The Redskins relocated south from New England after five years to the national capital of Washington , D.C. in 1937 . In their early years in Washington , the Redskins shared baseball 's Griffith Stadium with the first Washington Senators baseball team of the American League . The Redskins played and won their first game in Washington , D.C. on September 16 , 1937 , a victory against the Giants , 13 -- 3 . On December 5 , 1937 , they earned their first division title in Washington against the Giants , 49 -- 14 , for the Eastern Championship . The team then proceeded to win their first league championship , the 1937 NFL Championship Game , on December 12 , 1937 , against the Chicago Bears , their first year in their new city of D.C. The Redskins then met the Bears again in the 1940 NFL Championship Game on December 8 , 1940 . The result , 73 -- 0 in favor of the Bears , is still the worst one - sided loss in NFL history . The other big loss for the Redskins that season occurred during a coin - tossing ceremony prior to a game against the Giants . After calling the coin toss and shaking hands with the opposing team captain , Turk Edwards attempted to pivot around to head back to his sideline . However , his cleats caught in the grass and his knee gave way , injuring him and bringing his season and career to an unusual end .
