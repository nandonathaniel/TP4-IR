According to the colonial era scholarship , as early as the 6th century , another people called the Mon began to enter the present - day Lower Burma from the Mon kingdoms of Haribhunjaya and Dvaravati in modern - day Thailand . By the mid 9th century , the Mon had founded at least two small kingdoms ( or large city - states ) centred around Bago and Thaton . The earliest external reference to a Mon kingdom in Lower Burma was in 844 -- 848 by Arab geographers . But recent research shows that there is no evidence ( archaeological or otherwise ) to support colonial period conjectures that a Mon - speaking polity existed in Lower Burma until the late 13th century , and the first recorded claim that the kingdom of Thaton existed came only in 1479 .
