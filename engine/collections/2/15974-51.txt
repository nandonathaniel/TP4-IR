Once the final modifications had been made , the Committee of Style and Arrangement was appointed `` to revise the style of and arrange the articles which had been agreed to by the house . '' Unlike other committees , whose members were named so the committees included members from different regions , this final committee included no champions of the small states . Its members were mostly in favor of a strong national government and unsympathetic to calls for states ' rights . They were William Samuel Johnson ( Connecticut ) , Alexander Hamilton ( New York ) , Gouverneur Morris ( Pennsylvania ) , James Madison ( Virginia ) , and Rufus King ( Massachusetts ) . On Wednesday , September 12 , the report of the `` committee of style '' was ordered printed for the convenience of the delegates . For three days , the Convention compared this final version with the proceedings of the Convention . The Constitution was then ordered engrossed on Saturday , September 15 by Jacob Shallus , and was submitted for signing on September 17 . It made at least one important change to what the Convention had agreed to ; King wanted to prevent states from interfering in contracts . Although the Convention never took up the matter , his language was now inserted , creating the contract clause .
