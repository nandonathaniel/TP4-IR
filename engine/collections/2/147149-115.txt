In the early modern period , Dutch - speaking cartographers made important contributions to the art of map design . Netherlandish ( Dutch & Flemish ) cartographers ' publications are remarkable milestones in the history of cartography , the extant editions are not only valuable sources of contemporary geographic knowledge but also fine works of art . The main role in this was played by a special artistic atmosphere of the Netherlands ( or the Low Countries ) in the 16th and 17th centuries . The Low Countries experienced cultural and economic booms that was combined with enthusiasm of different classes of people for geography and maps . The unique atmosphere made mapmaking a form of art . Cartography and visual arts were related activities : art and mapmaking interacted with each other : many cartographic elements , such as images , colour , and lettering , were shared with art ; tools and methods used to produce maps and artistic works were very similar in printmaking and in mapmaking : copperplate engravings , which were hand coloured in later , required specific artistic skills ; a significant number of both little - known and the most outstanding artists were involved in decorating maps ; maps and art works were often performed by the same artists , engravers and publishers who worked for both areas ; artists , engravers and mapmakers belonged to the same group of society that determined the development of culture in many areas . As James A. Welu ( 1987 ) notes , `` For roughly a century , from 1570 to 1670 , mapmakers working in the Low Countries brought about unprecedented advances in the art of cartography . The maps , charts , and globes issued during this period , at first mainly in Antwerp and later in Amsterdam , are distinguished not only by their accuracy according to the knowledge of the time , but also by their richness of ornamentation , a combination of science and art that has rarely been surpassed in the history of mapmaking .
