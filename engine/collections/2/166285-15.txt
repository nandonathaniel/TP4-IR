Since the operating system has effectively suspended the execution of one process , it can then switch context by choosing a process from the ready queue and restoring its PCB . In doing so , the program counter from the PCB is loaded , and thus execution can continue in the chosen process . Process and thread priority can influence which process is chosen from the ready queue ( i.e. , it may be a priority queue ) .
