On Day 28 , the original Islanders were told that they would be re-coupling . They were only given the option to remain in their current couple or to choose one of the new Islanders . However , as the boys and the girls were living in separate villas , they were not aware of what the other one chose . If one decided to re-couple and the other did not , then the one that did not would be dumped from the island . If both re-coupled then they would both remain in the villa with their new partner , or if they both remained then any remaining single Islanders would be eliminated . Olivia and Chris , and Gabby and Marcel both stayed loyal , whereas Amber and Kem both decided to re-couple with Nathan and Chyna respectively . Camilla and Jonny also decided to re-couple , choosing Craig and Danielle . Elsewhere Montana decided to re-couple with Alex , but Dom stayed loyal and therefore was dumped from the Island . As new Islanders Amelia , Ellisha - Jade , Marino , Rob , Shannen and Steve stayed single , they were eliminated .
