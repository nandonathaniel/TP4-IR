The Corps of Engineers recommended the excavation of a 5 - foot - deep ( 1.5 m ) channel at the Des Moines Rapids , but work did not begin until after Lieutenant Robert E. Lee endorsed the project in 1837 . The Corps later also began excavating the Rock Island Rapids . By 1866 , it had become evident that excavation was impractical , and it was decided to build a canal around the Des Moines Rapids . The canal opened in 1877 , but the Rock Island Rapids remained an obstacle . In 1878 , Congress authorized the Corps to establish a 4.5 - foot - deep ( 1.4 m ) channel to be obtained by building wing dams which direct the river to a narrow channel causing it to cut a deeper channel , by closing secondary channels and by dredging . The channel project was complete when the Moline Lock , which bypassed the Rock Island Rapids , opened in 1907 .
