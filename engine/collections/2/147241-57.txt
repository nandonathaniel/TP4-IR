Until the introduction of guns in the 15th century , traditional weapons like the spear , short sword , and bow held sway . Efforts were made to reorganize a local guild of blacksmiths in the 18th century to manufacture light firearms , but dependence on imports was still heavy . Before the coming of the gun , guilds of blacksmiths were charged with war production -- particularly swords and iron spearheads .
