The offensive continued in the southern part with the launch of Operation Roland on 14 July . But after three days , on 17 July , the II SS Panzer Corps was ordered to end its offensive operations and begin withdrawing . This marked the end of Operation Roland . One of the panzer corps ' divisions was transferred to Italy and the other two were sent south to meet new Soviet offensives . The strength of the Soviet reserve formations had been greatly underestimated by German intelligence , and the Red Army soon went onto the offensive . In his post-war memoirs Lost Victories , Manstein was highly critical of Hitler 's decision to call off the operation at the height of the tactical battle . The veracity of Manstein 's claims of a near victory is debatable . The extent of Soviet reserves was far greater than he realised . These reserves were used to re-equip the mauled 5th Guards Tank Army , which launched Operation Rumyantsev a couple of weeks later . The result was a battle of attrition they were ill - prepared for and which they had little chance of winning .
