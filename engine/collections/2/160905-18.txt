On June 17 , 2014 , Popeyes announced it had re-acquired full control of its seasonings , recipes , and other proprietary food preparation techniques from Diversified Foods & Seasonings , which remained under the control of Al Copeland and his estate after the creditor sale of Popeyes to AFC . Popeyes had continued to license the seasonings , recipes , and techniques from DF&S for a yearly ' spice royalty ' , before buying them outright for $43 million . DFS remains the main supplier for Popeyes until at least 2029 .
