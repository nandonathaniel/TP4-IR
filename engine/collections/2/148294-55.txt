Baldwin has called the attorneys in the case `` opportunists '' , and has characterized Basinger 's psychologists as part of the `` divorce industry '' . He has faulted them more than Basinger , and writes , `` In fact , I blame my ex-wife least of all for what has transpired . She is a person , like many of us , doing the best she can with what she has . She is a litigant , and therefore , one who walks into a courtroom and is never offered anything other than what is served there . Nothing off the menu , ever . '' Baldwin wrote that he spent over a million dollars , has had to put time aside from his career , has had to travel extensively , and needed to find a house in California ( he lived in New York ) , so that he could stay in his daughter 's life .
