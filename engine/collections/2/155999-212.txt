Owing to its isolation from the other Romance languages , the phonetic evolution of Romanian was quite different , but the language does share a few changes with Italian , such as ( kl ) → ( kj ) ( Lat . clarus → Rom . chiar , Ital . chiaro , Lat . clamare → Rom . chemare , Ital . chiamare ) and ( ɡl ) → ( ɡj ) ( Lat . * glacia ( glacies ) → Rom . gheață , Ital . ghiaccia , ghiaccio , Lat . * ungla ( ungula ) → Rom . unghie , Ital . unghia ) , although this did not go as far as it did in Italian with other similar clusters ( Rom . place , Ital . piace ) ; another similarity with Italian is the change from ( ke ) or ( ki ) to ( tʃe ) or ( tʃi ) ( Lat . pax , pacem → Rom. and Ital . pace , Lat . dulcem → Rom . dulce , Ital . dolce , Lat . circus → Rom . cerc , Ital . circo ) and ( ɡe ) or ( ɡi ) to ( dʒe ) or ( dʒi ) ( Lat . gelu → Rom . ger , Ital . gelo , Lat . marginem → Rom. and Ital . margine , Lat . gemere → Rom . geme ( gemere ) , Ital . gemere ) . There are also a few changes shared with Dalmatian , such as / ɡn / ( probably phonetically ( ŋn ) ) → ( mn ) ( Lat . cognatus → Rom . cumnat , Dalm . comnut ) and / ks / → ( ps ) in some situations ( Lat . coxa → Rom . coapsă , Dalm . copsa ) .
