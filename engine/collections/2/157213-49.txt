Greater species diversity of fish increases the stability of fisheries yield ( Synthesis of 8 observational studies ) Greater species diversity of natural pest enemies decreases herbivorous pest populations ( Data from two separate reviews ; Synthesis of 266 experimental and observational studies ; Synthesis of 18 observational studies . Although another review of 38 experimental studies found mixed support for this claim , suggesting that in cases where mutual intraguild predation occurs , a single predatory species is often more effective Greater species diversity of plants decreases disease prevalence on plants ( Synthesis of 107 experimental studies ) Greater species diversity of plants increases resistance to plant invasion ( Data from two separate reviews ; Synthesis of 105 experimental studies ; Synthesis of 15 experimental studies ) Greater species diversity of plants increases carbon sequestration , but note that this finding only relates to actual uptake of carbon dioxide and not long term storage , see below ; Synthesis of 479 experimental studies ) Greater species diversity of plants increases soil nutrient remineralization ( Synthesis of 103 experimental studies ) Greater species diversity of plants increases soil organic matter ( Synthesis of 85 experimental studies )
