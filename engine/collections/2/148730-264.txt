By contrast there was also a smaller but influential stream of anti-New Deal art . Gutzon Borglum 's sculptures on Mount Rushmore emphasized great men in history ( his designs had the approval of Calvin Coolidge ) . Gertrude Stein and Ernest Hemingway disliked the New Deal and celebrated the autonomy of perfected written work as opposed to the New Deal idea of writing as performative labor . The Southern Agrarians celebrated a premodern regionalism and opposed the TVA as a modernizing , disruptive force . Cass Gilbert , a conservative who believed architecture should reflect historic traditions and the established social order , designed the new Supreme Court building ( 1935 ) . Its classical lines and small size contrasted sharply with the gargantuan modernistic federal buildings going up in the Washington Mall that he detested . Hollywood managed to synthesize liberal and conservative streams , as in Busby Berkeley 's Gold Digger musicals , where the storylines exalt individual autonomy while the spectacular musical numbers show abstract populations of interchangeable dancers securely contained within patterns beyond their control .
