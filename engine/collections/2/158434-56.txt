Several words from Robin Gibb 's Concorde ticket inspired the Gibbs to write the lyrics for `` Stayin ' Alive '' . Robin recalls , `` The subject matter of ' Stayin ' Alive ' is actually quite a serious one ; It 's about survival in the streets of New York , and the lyrics actually say that '' . Barry Gibb also recalls , `` People crying out for help . Desperate songs . Those are the ones that become giants . The minute you capture that on record , it 's gold . ' Stayin ' Alive ' is the epitome of that . Everybody struggles against the world , fighting all the bullshit and things that can drag you down . And it really is a victory just to survive . But when you climb back on top and win bigger than ever before , well that 's something everybody reacts to everybody '' . `` We 'd also written a song called ' Saturday Night ' '' , Maurice explains , `` But there were so many songs called ' Saturday Night ' even one by the Bay City Rollers , so when we rewrote it for the movie , we called it ' Stayin ' Alive ' .
