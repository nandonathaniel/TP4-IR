Focusing on parts of Asia , hope has taken on a secular or materialistic form in relation to the pursuit of economic growth . Primary examples are the rise of the economies of China and India , correlating with the notion of Chindia . A secondary relevant example is the increased use of contemporary architecture in rising economies , such as the building of the Shanghai World Financial Center , Burj Khalifa and Taipei 101 , which has given rise to a prevailing hope within the countries of origin . In chaotic environments hope is transcended without cultural boundaries , Syrian refugee children are supported by UNESCO 's education project through creative education and psycho - social assistance . Other inter-cultural support for instilling hope involve food culture , disengaging refugees from trauma through immersing them in their rich cultural past .
