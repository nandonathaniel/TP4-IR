With the end of the fifth season , the content of the show has reached the plot of the latest novel in Martin 's A Song of Ice and Fire series , A Dance with Dragons . Season 6 director Jeremy Podeswa said in August 2015 : `` Right now in season six , what we 're shooting currently is n't based on anything in the book . It 's fully based on discussions the writers have had with George Martin , because the series has now surpassed the books in terms of what 's available . '' Actress Natalie Dormer , who plays Margaery Tyrell , later added that the show 's writers `` know where it 's got to go and what ( George Martin ) 's intentions for the characters are . But they are just filling in the gaps . ''
