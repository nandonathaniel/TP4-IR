Herbalists tend to use extracts from parts of plants , such as the roots or leaves but not isolate particular phytochemicals . Pharmaceutical medicine prefers single ingredients on the grounds that dosage can be more easily quantified . It is also possible to patent single compounds , and therefore generate income . Herbalists often reject the notion of a single active ingredient , arguing that the different phytochemicals present in many herbs will interact to enhance the therapeutic effects of the herb and dilute toxicity . Furthermore , they argue that a single ingredient may contribute to multiple effects . Herbalists deny that herbal synergism can be duplicated with synthetic chemicals They argue that phytochemical interactions and trace components may alter the drug response in ways that can not currently be replicated with a combination of a few potentially active ingredients . Pharmaceutical researchers recognize the concept of drug synergism but note that clinical trials may be used to investigate the efficacy of a particular herbal preparation , provided the formulation of that herb is consistent .
