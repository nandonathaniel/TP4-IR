Due to the lack of basic amenities and medical facilities in Haiti a large number of Haitian women , often arriving with several health problems , cross the border to Dominican soil . They deliberately come during their last weeks of pregnancy to obtain medical attention for childbirth , since Dominican public hospitals do not refuse medical services based on nationality or legal status . Statistics from a hospital in Santo Domingo report that over 22 % of childbirths are by Haitian mothers .
