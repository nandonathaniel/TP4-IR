Foote of Mississippi pulls a pistol on an anti-slavery senator on the floor of the U.S. Senate . President Taylor dies on July 9 and is succeeded by Vice President Millard Fillmore . Although he is a New Yorker , Fillmore is more inclined to compromise with or even support Southern interests . Henry Clay proposes the Compromise of 1850 to handle California 's petition for admission to the union as a free state and Texas 's demand for land in New Mexico . Clay proposes ( 1 ) admission of California , ( 2 ) prohibition of Texas expansion into New Mexico , ( 3 ) compensation of $10 million to Texas to finance its public debt , ( 4 ) permission to citizens of New Mexico and Utah to vote on whether slavery would be allowed in their territories ( popular sovereignty ) , ( 5 ) a ban of the slave trade in the District of Columbia ; slavery would still be allowed in the district , and ( 6 ) a stronger fugitive slave law with more vigorous enforcement . Under the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 , a slave owner could reclaim a runaway slave by establishing ownership before a commissioner rather than in a jury trial . Clay 's initial omnibus bill that included all these provisions failed . Senator Stephen A. Douglas of Illinois then established different coalitions that passed each provision separately . Responses to the Compromise of 1850 varied . Southerners cease movement toward disunion but are angered by Northern resistance to enforcement of the Fugitive Slave Act . Anti-slavery forces are upset about possible expansion of slavery in the Southwest and the stronger fugitive slave law that could require all U.S. citizens to assist in returning fugitive slaves . The Nashville Convention of nine Southern states discusses states ' rights and slavery in June ; in November , the convention talks about secession but adjourns due to the passage of the laws that constitute the Compromise of 1850 . Utah is organized as a territory and adopts a slave code . Only 29 slaves are found in the territory in 1860 . In October , the Boston Vigilance Committee frees two fugitive slaves , Ellen and William Craft , from jail and being returned to Georgia . 1851 Southern Unionists in several states defeat secession measures .

New York , a New York court frees eight slaves in transit from Virginia with their owner . After magazine publication , Uncle Tom 's Cabin by Harriet Beecher Stowe is published in book form .

It sells between 500,000 and 1,000,000 copies in U.S. and even more in Great Britain . Millions of people see the stage adaptation . By June 1852 , Southerners move to suppress the book 's publication in the South and numerous `` refutations '' appear in print . April 30 : A convention called by the legislature in South Carolina adopts `` An Ordinance to Declare the Right of this State to Secede from the Federal Union '' .

The United States adds a 29,670 - square - mile ( 76,800 km ) region of present - day southern Arizona and southwestern New Mexico to the United States through the Gadsden Purchase of territory from Mexico . The purposes of the Gadsden Purchase are the construction of a transcontinental railroad along a deep southern route and the reconciliation of outstanding border issues following the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo , which ended the Mexican -- American War . Many early settlers in the region are pro-slavery . Filibusterer William Walker and a few dozen men briefly take over Baja California in an effort to expand slave territory . When they are forced to retreat to California and put on trial for violating neutrality laws , they are acquitted by a jury that deliberated for only eight minutes . 1854 Democratic U.S. Senator Stephen A. Douglas of Illinois proposes the Kansas -- Nebraska Bill to open good Midwestern farmland to settlement and to encourage building of a transcontinental railroad with a terminus at Chicago . Whether slavery would be permitted in a territory would be determined by a vote of the people at the time a territory is organized . Congress enacts the Kansas -- Nebraska Act , providing that popular sovereignty , a vote of the people when a territory is organized , will decide `` all questions pertaining to slavery '' in the Kansas -- Nebraska territories . This abrogates the Missouri Compromise prohibition of slavery north of the 36 Â° 30 ' line of latitude and increases Northerners ' fears of a Slave Power encroaching on the North . Both Northerners and Southerners rush to the Kansas and Nebraska territories to express their opinion in the voting . Especially in Kansas , many voters are pro-slavery Missouri residents who enter Kansas simply to vote . Opponents of slavery and the Kansas -- Nebraska Act meet in Ripon , Wisconsin in February , and subsequently meet in other Northern states , to form the Republican Party . The party includes many former members of the Whig and Free Soil parties and some northern Democrats . Republicans win most of the Northern state seats in the U.S. House of Representatives in the fall 1854 elections as 66 of 91 Northern state Democrats are defeated . Abraham Lincoln emerges as a Republican leader in the West ( Illinois ) . Eli Thayer forms the New England Emigrant Aid Society to encourage settlement of Kansas by persons opposed to slavery .

Four months after the dispatch is drafted , it is published in full at the request of the U.S. House of Representatives . Northern states view the document as a Southern attempt to extend slavery . European nations consider it as a threat to Spain and to Imperial power . The U.S. government never acts upon the recommendations in the Ostend Manifesto . Anthony Burns , a fugitive slave from Virginia , is arrested by federal agents in Boston . Radical abolitionists attack the court house and kill a deputy marshal in an unsuccessful attempt to free Burns .

Ableman . The Knights of the Golden Circle , a fraternal organization that wants to expand slavery to Mexico , Central America , the Caribbean Islands , including Cuba , and northern South America , is founded in Louisville , Kentucky . Former Mississippi Governor John A. Quitman begins to raise money and volunteers to invade Cuba , but is slow to act and cancels the invasion plan in spring 1855 when President Pierce says he would enforce the neutrality laws . The Know - Nothing Party or American Party , which includes many nativist former Whigs , sweeps state and local elections in parts of some Northern states . The party demands ethnic purification , opposes Catholics ( because of the presumed power of the Pope over them ) , and opposes corruption in local politics . The party soon fades away . George Fitzhugh 's pro-slavery Sociology for the South is published . 1855 Violence by pro-slavery looters from Missouri known as Border Ruffians and anti-slavery groups known as Jayhawkers breaks out in `` Bleeding Kansas '' as pro-slavery and anti-slavery supporters try to organize the territory as slave or free . Many Ruffians vote illegally in Kansas . Estimates will show that the violence in Kansas resulted in about 200 persons killed and $2 million worth of property destroyed during the middle and late 1850s . Over 95 percent of the pro-slavery votes in the election of a Kansas territorial legislature in 1855 were later determined to be fraudulent . Anti-slavery Kansans draft an anti-slavery constitution , the Topeka Constitution , and elect a new legislature , which actually represent the majority of legal voters . Meanwhile , the initial fraudulently elected but legal Kansas legislature still exists . 1856 May 21 : Missouri Ruffians and local pro-slavery men sack and burn the anti-slavery town of Lawrence , Kansas . John Brown , an abolitionist born in Connecticut , and his sons kill five pro-slavery men from Pottawatomie Creek in retaliation for the Sacking of Lawrence . May 22 : Congressman Preston Brooks of South Carolina beats with a cane and incapacitates Senator Charles Sumner of Massachusetts on the floor of the U.S. Senate . In a speech in the Senate chamber , The Crime Against Kansas , Sumner ridicules slaveowners -- especially Brooks 's cousin , U.S. Senator Andrew Butler of South Carolina -- as in love with a prostitute ( slavery ) and raping the virgin Kansas . Brooks is a hero in the South , Sumner a martyr in the North . In the 1856 U.S. presidential election Republican John C. FrÃ©mont crusades against slavery . The Republican slogan is `` Free speech , free press , free soil , free men , FrÃ©mont and victory ! '' Democrats counter that Fremont 's election could lead to civil war . The Democratic Party candidate , James Buchanan , who carries five northern and western states and all the southern states except Maryland , wins . Thomas Prentice Kettell , a New York Democrat , writes Southern Wealth and Northern Profits , a lengthy statistical pamphlet about the economies of the Northern and Southern regions of the country .

Or Slaves Without Masters , which defends chattel slavery and ridicules free labor as wage slavery . Commercial conventions in the South call for the reopening of the African slave trade , thinking that a ready access to inexpensive slaves would spread slavery to the territories . Hinton Rowan Helper , a North Carolinian , publishes The Impending Crisis of the South , which argues that slavery was the main cause of the South 's economic stagnation . This charge angers many Southerners . The U.S. Supreme Court reaches the Dred Scott v. Sandford decision , a 7 to 2 ruling that Congress lacks the power to exclude slavery from the territories , that slaves are property and have no rights as citizens and that slaves are not made free by living in free territory . Chief Justice Roger B. Taney concludes that the Missouri Compromise is unconstitutional . If a court majority clearly agreed ( which it did not in this decision ) , this conclusion would allow all territories to be open to slavery . Scott and his family were purchased and freed by a supporter 's children . Northerners vowed to oppose the decision as in violation of a `` higher law '' . Antagonism between the sections of the country increases .

In August , a short economic depression , the Panic of 1857 , arises , mainly in large northern cities , as a result of speculation in and inflated values of railroad stocks and real estate . Southerners tout the small effect in their section as support for their economic and labor system . Buchanan endorses the Lecompton constitution and breaks with Douglas , who regards the document as a mockery of popular sovereignty because its referendum provision does not offer a true free state option .

Hunter of Virginia , uses the Walker Tariff as a base and lowers rates . 1858 The free state of Minnesota is admitted to the Union .

The Lincoln - Douglas Debates of 1858 focus on issues and arguments that will dominate the Presidential election campaign of 1860 . Pro-Douglas candidates win a small majority in the Illinois legislature in the general election and choose Douglas as U.S. Senator from Illinois for another term . However , Lincoln emerges as a nationally known moderate spokesman for Republicans and a moderate opponent of slavery . In a debate with Lincoln at Freeport , Illinois , Douglas expresses an opinion which becomes known as the `` Freeport Doctrine '' . Lincoln asks whether the people of a territory could lawfully exclude slavery before the territory became a state . In effect , this question asks Douglas to reconcile popular sovereignty with the Dred Scott decision . Douglas says they could do so by refusing to pass the type of police regulations needed to sustain slavery . This answer further alienates pro-slavery advocates from Douglas . `` Cotton is King ! '' proclaims Senator James Henry Hammond of South Carolina : `` No , you dare not make war on cotton . No power on earth dares to make war upon it . Cotton is King ; until lately the Bank of England was king ; but she tried to put her screws , as usual ... on the cotton crop , and was utterly vanquished '' , which seemingly means that even Europe was dependent on the cotton economy of the Southern states and would have to intervene in any U.S. conflict , even an internal threat , to protect its source of vital raw material , King Cotton . William Lowndes Yancey and Edmund Ruffin found the League of United Southerners . They advocate reopening the African slave trade and formation of a Southern confederacy . U.S. Senator William H.

On October 4 , Kansas voters adopt the anti-slavery Wyandotte Constitution by a 2 to 1 margin . On October 16 , Kansas abolitionist John Brown attempts to spark a slave rebellion in Virginia through seizure of weapons from the federal armory at Harpers Ferry . Brown holds the arsenal for 36 hours . No slaves join him and no rebellion ensues but seventeen persons , including 10 of Brown 's men , are killed . Brown and his remaining men are captured by U.S. Marines led by Army Lieutenant Colonel Robert E. Lee . Brown is tried for treason to the state of Virginia , found guilty and hanged on December 2 in Charles Town , Virginia ( now Charlestown , West Virginia ) .
