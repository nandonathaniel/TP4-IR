Bronx Memoir Project : Vol. 1 is a published anthology by the Bronx Council on the Arts and brought forth through a series of workshops meant to empower Bronx residents and shed the stigma on the Bronx 's burning past . The Bronx Memoir Project was created as an ongoing collaboration between the Bronx Council on the Arts and other cultural institutions , including The Bronx Documentary Center , The Bronx Library Center , the ( Edgar Allan ) Poe Park Visitor Center , Mindbuilders , and other institutions and funded through a grant from the National Endowment for the Arts . The goal was to develop and refine memoir fragments written by people of all walks of life that share a common bond residing within the Bronx .
