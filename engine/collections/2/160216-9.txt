Gold - colored coins have made a comeback in many currencies . However , `` gold coin '' ( in numismatic terminology ) always refers to a coin that is ( more or less ) made of gold , and does not include coins made of manganese brass or other alloys . Furthermore , many countries continue to make legal tender gold coins , but these are primarily meant for collectors and investment purposes and are not meant for circulation .
