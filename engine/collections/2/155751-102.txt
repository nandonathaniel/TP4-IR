In Spain , fresh sausages , salchichas , which are eaten cooked , and cured sausages , embutidos , which are eaten uncooked , are two distinct categories . Among the cured sausages are found products like chorizo , salchich√≥n , and sobrasada . Blood sausage , morcilla , is found in both cured and fresh varieties . They are made with pork meat and blood , usually adding rice , garlic , paprika and other spices . There are many regional variations , and in general they are either fried or cooked in cocidos .
