Societas Domi Pacificae , known colloquially as `` Pacifica House , '' is a present - day , self - described secret society , which nonetheless publishes a website and an email address . It claims a continuous line of descent from the Franklin Society of 1824 , citing a supposed intermediary `` Franklin Society '' traceable in the nineteenth century . But the intermediary turns out to be , on closer inspection , the well - known Providence Franklin Society , a civic organization unconnected to Brown whose origins and activity are well - documented . It was founded in 1821 by merchants William Grinnell and Joseph Balch , Jr. , and chartered by the General Assembly in January 1823 . The `` Pacifica House '' account of this ( conflated ) Franklin Society cites published mentions of it in 1859 , 1876 , and 1883 . But the first of these ( Rhees 1859 , see footnote infra ) is merely a sketch of the 1824 Brown organization ; the second ( Stockwell 1876 ) is a reference - book article on the Providence Franklin Society itself ; and the third is the Providence Franklin Society 's own publication , which the `` Pacifica House '' reference mis - ascribes to the `` Franklin Society , '' dropping the word `` Providence .
