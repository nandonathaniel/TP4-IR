Typical metalloids have a metallic appearance , but they are brittle and only fair conductors of electricity . Chemically , they behave mostly as nonmetals . They can form alloys with metals . Most of their other physical and chemical properties are intermediate in nature . Metalloids are usually too brittle to have any structural uses . They and their compounds are used in alloys , biological agents , catalysts , flame retardants , glasses , optical storage and optoelectronics , pyrotechnics , semiconductors , and electronics .
