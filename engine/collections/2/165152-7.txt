The Cenozoic is divided into three periods : the Paleogene , Neogene , and Quaternary ; and seven epochs : the Paleocene , Eocene , Oligocene , Miocene , Pliocene , Pleistocene , and Holocene . The Quaternary Period was officially recognized by the International Commission on Stratigraphy in June 2009 , and the former Tertiary Period was officially disused in 2004 because of the necessity to divide the Cenozoic into periods more like that of the previous Paleozoic and Mesozoic eras . The common use of epochs during the Cenozoic helps paleontologists better organize and group the many significant events that occurred during this comparatively short interval of time . There is also more detailed knowledge of this era than any other because of the relatively young , well - preserved rocks associated with it .
