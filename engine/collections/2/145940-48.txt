The Spanish government refused to abandon the area completely out of fear that such an action would make them appear weak . While they planned a response , Indians raided the San Saba horse herd , stealing all of the horses and pack mules and killing 20 soldiers . In October 1759 , Spain sent the San Sabá commander , Colonel Diego Ortiz Parrilla , on an expedition north to the Red River to avenge the attack . The tribes were forewarned and led Parrilla 's army to a fortified Wichita village , surrounded by a stockade and a moat , where natives brandished French guns and waved a French flag . After a skirmish in which 52 Spaniards were killed , wounded , or deserted , the Spanish retreated . The San Sabá presidio was replaced with a limestone fortress and a moat , but the Comanches and their allies remained close and killed any soldiers who ventured out . By 1769 , Spain abandoned the fort .
