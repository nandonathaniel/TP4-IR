In the first few superactinides , the binding energies of the added electrons are predicted to be small enough that they can lose all their valence electrons ; for example , unbihexium ( element 126 ) could easily form a + 8 oxidation state , and even higher oxidation states for the next few elements may be possible . Unbihexium is also predicted to display a variety of other oxidation states : recent calculations have suggested a stable monofluoride UbhF may be possible , resulting from a bonding interaction between the 5g orbital on unbihexium and the 2 p orbital on fluorine . Other predicted oxidation states include + 2 , + 4 , and + 6 ; + 4 is expected to be the most usual oxidation state of unbihexium . The presence of electrons in g - orbitals , which do not exist in the ground state electron configuration of any currently known element , should allow presently unknown hybrid orbitals to form and influence the chemistry of the superactinides in new ways , although the absence of g electrons in known elements makes predicting their chemistry more difficult .
