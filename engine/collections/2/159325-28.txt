On the night of 9 -- 10 March , 1945 ( `` Operation Meetinghouse '' ) , 334 B - 29s took off to raid with 279 of them dropping 1,665 tons of bombs on Tokyo . The bombs were mostly the 500 - pound ( 230 kg ) E-46 cluster bomb which released 38 napalm - carrying M - 69 incendiary bomblets at an altitude of 2,000 -- 2,500 ft ( 610 -- 760 m ) . The M - 69s punched through thin roofing material or landed on the ground ; in either case they ignited 3 -- 5 seconds later , throwing out a jet of flaming napalm globs . A lesser number of M - 47 incendiaries was also dropped : the M - 47 was a 100 - pound ( 45 kg ) jelled - gasoline and white phosphorus bomb which ignited upon impact . In the first two hours of the raid , 226 of the attacking aircraft unloaded their bombs to overwhelm the city 's fire defenses . The first B - 29s to arrive dropped bombs in a large X pattern centered in Tokyo 's densely populated working class district near the docks in both Koto and Chuo city wards on the water ; later aircraft simply aimed near this flaming X . The individual fires caused by the bombs joined to create a general conflagration , which would have been classified as a firestorm but for prevailing winds gusting at 17 to 28 mph ( 27 to 45 km / h ) . Approximately 15.8 square miles ( 4,090 ha ) of the city were destroyed and some 100,000 people are estimated to have died . A grand total of 282 of the 339 B - 29s launched for `` Meetinghouse '' made it to the target , 27 of which were lost due to being shot down by Japanese air defenses , mechanical failure , or being caught in updrafts caused by the massive fires .
