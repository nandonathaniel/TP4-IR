As Carthage fought with Numidia without Roman consent , the Third Punic War began when Rome declared war against Carthage in 149 BC . Carthage resisted well at the first strike , with the participation of all the inhabitants of the city . However , Carthage could not withstand the attack of Scipio Aemilianus , who entirely destroyed the city and its walls , enslaved and sold all the citizens and gained control of that region , which became the province of Africa . Thus ended the Punic War period .
