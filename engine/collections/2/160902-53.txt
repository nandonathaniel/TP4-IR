The fear of Japanese invasion during the Burma Campaign and the implementation by the military of a ' denial policy ' implemented in 1942 caused considerable hardship to the delta region . A devastating cyclone and tidal waves whipped the coastal region on 26 October but relief efforts were hindered due to bureaucratic interference . On 3 August , a number of prisoners were shot down in Dhaka jail but no inquiry could be held again due to bureaucratic intervention . Another severe strain on the administration was caused when the Congress launched the Quit India movement on 9 August , which was followed by British political repression . The entire province reverberated with protest . The situation was further complicated when Mukherjee resigned bitterly complaining against the interference of the governor in the work of the ministry .
