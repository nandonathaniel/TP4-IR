One of the main mechanisms by which radionuclides were passed to humans was through the ingestion of milk from contaminated cows . Most of the rough grazing that the cows took part in contained plant species such as coarse grasses , sedges , rushes , and plants such as heather ( also known as calluna vulgaris ) . These plant species grow in soils that are high in organic matter , low in pH , and are often very well hydrated , thus making the storage and intake of these radionuclides much more feasible and efficient . In the early stages following the Chernobyl accident , high levels of radionuclides were found in the milk and were a direct result of contaminated feeding . Within two months of banning most of the milk that was being produced in the affected areas , officials had phased out the majority of the contaminated feed that was available to the cows and much of the contamination was isolated . In humans , ingestion of milk containing abnormally high levels of iodine radionuclides was the precursor for thyroid disease , especially in children and in the immunocompromised .
