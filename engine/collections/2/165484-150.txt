The Soviet Union made an unsuccessful launch of an unmanned Zond space capsule that was intended to orbit the Moon as the next step in testing a Soviet manned lunar mission . Three minutes and 15 seconds after the launch , the Zond 's escape system activated inadvertently , shutting down the rocket engines and jettisoning the capsule back to Earth . The vehicle was recovered , intact , 520 kilometres ( 320 mi ) away from the launch site , but the next attempt could not be launched for three months .
