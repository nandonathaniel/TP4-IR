From 1510 to 1520 , Luther lectured on the Psalms , the books of Hebrews , Romans , and Galatians . As he studied these portions of the Bible , he came to view the use of terms such as penance and righteousness by the Roman Catholic Church in new ways . He became convinced that the church was corrupt in their ways and had lost sight of what he saw as several of the central truths of Christianity , the most important of which , for Luther , was the doctrine of justification -- God 's act of declaring a sinner righteous -- by faith alone through God 's grace . He began to teach that salvation or redemption is a gift of God 's grace , attainable only through faith in Jesus as the messiah .
