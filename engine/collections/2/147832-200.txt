In 1745 three of the greatest battles of the war occurred : Hohenfriedberg , Kesselsdorf and Fontenoy . The formation of the Quadruple Alliance of Britain , Austria , the Dutch Republic and Saxony was concluded at Warsaw on 8 January 1745 by the Treaty of Warsaw . Twelve days later on 20 January 1745 , the death of the Holy Roman Emperor , Charles VII , submitted the imperial title to a new election . Charles VII 's son and heir , Maximilian III of Bavaria , was not even considered a candidate for the Imperial throne . The Bavarian army was again unfortunate . Caught in its scattered winter quarters ( action of Amberg , 7 January ) , it was driven from point to point by a maneuver by the Austrian army under the joint command of Count Batthyány , Baron Bernklau and Count Browne . All Bavarian garrisons fled to the east . The Bavarian Army under the command of Count Törring was divided and paralyzed . The French in the area under Count Ségur marched to save the day . Count Sègur 's force out - numbered the Austrian army under Count Batthyany , yet Sègur and the French army were defeated at the Battle of Pfaffenhofen . The young elector Maximilian III had to abandon Munich once more . The Peace of Füssen followed on 22 April 1745 , by which Maximilian III secured his hereditary states on condition of supporting the candidature of the Grand - Duke Francis , consort of Maria Theresa . The `` imperial '' army ceased ipso facto to exist .
