The national government 's inability to resist foreign governments convinced many leaders , including Washington , Madison , and Hamilton , of the need for a new constitution with a stronger national government . Additionally , John Jay , Henry Knox , and others called for an independent executive who could govern more decisively than a large , legislative body like Congress . In 1786 , Charles Cotesworth Pinckney of South Carolina proposed the creation of a grand Congressional committee to consider constitutional amendments . The committee proposed seven amendments , and its proposals would have granted the central government the power to regulate commerce and fine states that failed to supply adequate funding to Congress . Congress failed to act on these proposals , and reformers began to take action outside of Congress .
