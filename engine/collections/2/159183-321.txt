Dr. Jordan Hampton ( Torri Higginson ) first appears in the episode `` Identity Crisis '' . When a `` John Doe '' is donated to science and Ducky finds mercury in his brain , he is outraged that the medical examiner who performed the autopsy did not think to check his brain before donating him . As he and Gibbs go to confront `` him '' ( Ducky mistakenly assumed that Dr. Hampton was male ) , he asks Gibbs to think no less of him for giving the M.E. a piece of his mind . After finding out that Dr. Hampton was not male , Ducky was visibly placated . Jordan came back to Ducky 's autopsy room to help him find anything else she might have missed , and decodes the tattoo on his arm , helping Gibbs and his team eventually solve the case . She also reveals in this episode that she likes things neat and clean . She made a reappearance in the episode `` Broken Bird '' to help Ducky overcome grief and guilt for euthanizing a tortured Afghan when he was a doctor in the military . The two show some romantic interest in both episodes . Also , although she did not appear in the episode , she gave Ducky the autopsy report for La Grenouille in the episode `` Internal Affairs '' .
