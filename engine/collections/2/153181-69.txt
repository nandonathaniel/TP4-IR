Yet the cross-cultural Hafsid alliance with Spain was not as unusual as it might seem , given the many Muslim - Christian treaties -- despite recurrent hostilities . Indeed , during the early 16th century , France allied with the Ottomans against the Spanish King Carlos . As an indirect result of Spain 's Africa policy , a few Muslim rulers encouraged Turkish forces to enter the region to counter the Spanish presence . Yet the Hafsid rulers of Tunis came to see the Turks and their corsair allies as a greater threat and entered a Spanish alliance , as also did the Sa'dids of Morocco . Nonetheless many Maghriban Muslims strongly preferred Islamic rule , and the Hafsid 's decades - long Spanish alliance was not generally popular , indeed anathema to some . On the other hand , the Saadi dynasty sultans of Morocco successfully played off Iberian against Turk , thus managing to remain both Muslim ruled and independent of the Ottoman grasp .
