In the depth range of 150 -- 900 metres ( 490 -- 2,950 feet ) is a water mass referred to as Atlantic Water . Inflow from the North Atlantic Current enters through the Fram Strait , cooling and sinking to form the deepest layer of the halocline , where it circles the Arctic Basin counter-clockwise . This is the highest volumetric inflow to the Arctic Ocean , equalling about 10 times that of the Pacific inflow , and it creates the Arctic Ocean Boundary Current . It flows slowly , at about 0.02 m / s . Atlantic Water has the same salinity as Arctic Bottom Water but is much warmer ( up to 3 Â° C ) . In fact , this water mass is actually warmer than the surface water , and remains submerged only due to the role of salinity in density . When water reaches the basin it is pushed by strong winds into a large circular current called the Beaufort Gyre . Water in the Beaufort Gyre is far less saline than that of the Chukchi Sea due to inflow from large Canadian and Siberian rivers .
