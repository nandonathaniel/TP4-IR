So , whenever the conditions are favourable , crystal formation results from simply cooling the solution . Here cooling is a relative term : austenite crystals in a steel form well above 1000 ° C. An example of this crystallization process is the production of Glauber 's salt , a crystalline form of sodium sulfate . In the diagram , where equilibrium temperature is on the x-axis and equilibrium concentration ( as mass percent of solute in saturated solution ) in y - axis , it is clear that sulfate solubility quickly decreases below 32.5 ° C. Assuming a saturated solution at 30 ° C , by cooling it to 0 ° C ( note that this is possible thanks to the freezing - point depression ) , the precipitation of a mass of sulfate occurs corresponding to the change in solubility from 29 % ( equilibrium value at 30 ° C ) to approximately 4.5 % ( at 0 ° C ) -- actually a larger crystal mass is precipitated , since sulfate entrains hydration water , and this has the side effect of increasing the final concentration .
