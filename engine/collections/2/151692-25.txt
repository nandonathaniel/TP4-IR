-- and the famous ghostly utterance , `` Let me in your window - I 'm so cold ! '' , was later used by Kate Bush in her 1978 hit `` Wuthering Heights '' . The entertainment world , indeed , has been so intrigued by the love between Catherine and Heathcliff that many film adaptations of the novel , particularly the 1939 version with Laurence Olivier and Merle Oberon , cover only half of the story , ending with Catherine 's death rather than the lives of the younger Cathy , Hareton , and Linton Heathcliff . Thematically , Catherine and her choice to marry Edgar rather than Heathcliff are central to the issues of nature versus nurture , self versus society , class division , and violence in Wuthering Heights , as well as to the antitheses of good and evil , and physical existence and spiritual existence , which pervade the novel .
