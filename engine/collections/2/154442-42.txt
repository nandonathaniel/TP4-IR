Even the chilliest nights can be followed by daytime temperatures well above 30 ° C ( 86.0 ° F ) . The high altitudes and undulating terrain of the FCT act as a moderating influence on the weather of the territory . The city 's inland location causes the diurnal temperature variation to be much larger than coastal cities with similar climates such as Lagos .
