If a worker delays receiving Social Security retirement benefits until after they reach full retirement age there is a Social Security benefits increase by a certain percentage -- depending on date of birth . After age 70 there are no more increases in retirement benefits allowed . Social Security uses an `` average '' survival rate at your full retirement age to prorate the increase in the amount of benefit increase so that the total benefits are roughly the same whenever you retire . Women may benefit more than men from this delayed benefit increase since the `` average '' survival rates are based on both men and women and women live approximately three years longer than men . The other consideration is that workers only have a limited number of years of `` good '' health left after they reach full retirement age and unless they enjoy their job they may be passing up an opportunity to do something else they may enjoy doing while they are still relatively healthy .
