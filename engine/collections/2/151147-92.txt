Presley was keen to resume regular live performing . Following the success of the Comeback Special , offers came in from around the world . The London Palladium offered Parker $28,000 for a one - week engagement . He responded , `` That 's fine for me , now how much can you get for Elvis ? '' In May , the brand new International Hotel in Las Vegas , boasting the largest showroom in the city , announced that it had booked Presley . He was scheduled to perform 57 shows over four weeks beginning July 31 . Moore , Fontana , and the Jordanaires declined to participate , afraid of losing the lucrative session work they had in Nashville . Presley assembled new , top - notch accompaniment , led by guitarist James Burton and including two gospel groups , The Imperials and Sweet Inspirations . Costume designer Bill Belew , responsible for the intense leather styling of the Comeback Special , created a new stage look for Presley inspired by the singer 's passion for karate . Nonetheless , he was nervous : his only previous Las Vegas engagement , in 1956 , had been dismal . Parker , who intended to make Presley 's return the show business event of the year , oversaw a major promotional push . For his part , hotel owner Kirk Kerkorian arranged to send his own plane to New York to fly in rock journalists for the debut performance .
