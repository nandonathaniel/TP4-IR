After the resolutions proposing a new national flag for Canada were passed by the two houses of parliament , a proclamation was drawn up for signature by the Canadian queen . This was created in the form of an illuminated document on vellum , with calligraphy by Yvonne Diceman and heraldic illustrations . The text was rendered in black ink , using a quill , while the heraldic elements were painted in gouache with gilt highlights . The Great Seal of Canada was embossed and secured by a silk ribbon .
