Hydrogen is usually considered an energy carrier , like electricity , as it must be produced from a primary energy source such as solar energy , biomass , electricity ( e.g. in the form of solar PV or via wind turbines ) , or hydrocarbons such as natural gas or coal . Conventional hydrogen production using natural gas induces significant environmental impacts ; as with the use of any hydrocarbon , carbon dioxide is emitted .
