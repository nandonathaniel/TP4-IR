Spherical harmonic analysis can be used to distinguish internal from external sources if measurements are available at more than one height ( for example , ground observatories and satellites ) . In that case , each term with coefficient g or h can be split into two terms : one that decreases with radius as 1 / r and one that increases with radius as r . The increasing terms fit the external sources ( currents in the ionosphere and magnetosphere ) . However , averaged over a few years the external contributions average to zero .
