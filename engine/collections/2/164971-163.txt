There were other considerable advancements in hydraulic engineering and nautical technology during the Song dynasty . The 10th - century invention of the pound lock for canal systems allowed different water levels to be raised and lowered for separated segments of a canal , which significantly aided the safety of canal traffic and allowed for larger barges . There was the Song - era innovation of watertight bulkhead compartments that allowed damage to hulls without sinking the ships . If ships were damaged , the Chinese of the 11th century employed drydocks to repair them while suspended out of the water . The Song used crossbeams to brace the ribs of ships in order to strengthen them in a skeletal - like structure . Stern - mounted rudders had been mounted on Chinese ships since the 1st century , as evidenced with a preserved Han tomb model of a ship . In the Song period , the Chinese devised a way to mechanically raise and lower rudders in order for ships to travel in a wider range of water depths . The Song arranged the protruding teeth of anchors in a circular pattern instead of in one direction . David Graff and Robin Higham state that this arrangement `` ( made ) them more reliable '' for anchoring ships .
