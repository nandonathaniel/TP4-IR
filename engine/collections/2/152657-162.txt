The United States helped revive the French economy with the Marshall Plan whereby it gave France $2.3 billion with no repayment . France agreed to reduce trade barriers and modernize its management system . The total of all American grants and credits to France , 1946 -- 53 , came to $4.9 billion , and low - interest loans added another $2 billion . The Marshall Plan set up intensive tours of American industry . France sent 500 missions with 4700 businessmen and experts to tour American factories , farms , stores and offices . They were especially impressed with the prosperity of American workers , and how they could purchase an inexpensive new automobile for nine months work , compared to 30 months in France . Some French businesses resisted Americanization , but others seized upon it to attract American investments and build a larger market . The industries that were most Americanized included chemicals , oil , electronics , and instrumentation . They were the most innovative , and most profitable sectors .
