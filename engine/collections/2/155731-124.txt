Raised however , by his grandfather Charles X of France , as if the Revolution never happened , the Count of Chambord insisted that he would only take the crown if France would abandon the tricolour flag in favor of the white fleur de lys flag . He refused to compromise this point , which upset the restoration of the monarchy . The Orl√©ans did not oppose him , and did not make an immediate claim to the throne while the Count of Chambord lived . The Count of Chambord lived , however , longer than expected . At the time of his death , the impetus behind the monarchical restoration had been lost .
