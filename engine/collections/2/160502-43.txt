The DSM - II used the term Hysterical Neurosis , Dissociative Type . It described the possible occurrence of alterations in the patient 's state of consciousness or identity , and included the symptoms of `` amnesia , somnambulism , fugue , and multiple personality '' . The DSM - III grouped the diagnosis with the other four major dissociative disorders using the term `` multiple personality disorder '' . The DSM - IV made more changes to DID than any other dissociative disorder , and renamed it DID . The name was changed for two reasons . First , the change emphasizes the main problem is not a multitude of personalities , but rather a lack of a single , unified identity and an emphasis on `` the identities as centers of information processing '' . Second , the term `` personality '' is used to refer to `` characteristic patterns of thoughts , feelings , moods and behaviors of the whole individual '' , while for a patient with DID , the switches between identities and behavior patterns is the personality . It is for this reason the DSM - IV - TR referred to `` distinct identities or personality states '' instead of personalities . The diagnostic criteria also changed to indicate that while the patient may name and personalize alters , they lack an independent , objective existence . The changes also included the addition of amnesia as a symptom , which was not included in the DSM - III - R because despite being a core symptom of the condition , patients may experience `` amnesia for the amnesia '' and fail to report it . Amnesia was replaced when it became clear that the risk of false negative diagnoses was low because amnesia was central to DID .
