The media and popular culture often erroneously credit atheist Madalyn Murray O'Hair with removing school prayer from US public schools , when the case against recitation of the Lord 's Prayer in Baltimore schools was decided by the Supreme Court in 1963 . A more significant case had reached the Supreme Court one year prior , suddenly changing the legal climate for school prayer in the US .
