Because of the inaccurate low readings , the reactor crew chief Alexander Akimov assumed that the reactor was intact . The evidence of pieces of graphite and reactor fuel lying around the building was ignored , and the readings of another dosimeter brought in by 04 : 30 were dismissed under the assumption that the new dosimeter must have been defective . Akimov stayed with his crew in the reactor building until morning , sending members of his crew to try to pump water into the reactor . None of them wore any protective gear . Most , including Akimov , died from radiation exposure within three weeks .
