Nickel prices boomed in the late 1990s , then declined from around $51,000 / £ 36,700 per metric ton in May 2007 to about $11,550 / £ 8,300 per metric ton in January 2009 . Prices were only just starting to recover as of January 2010 , but most of Australia 's nickel mines had gone bankrupt by then . As the price for high grade nickel sulphate ore recovered in 2010 , so did the Australian nickel mining industry .
