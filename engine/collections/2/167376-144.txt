Chester A. Arthur was born in Vermont on October 5 , 1829 to a Vermont - born mother and a father from Ireland ( who later became a U.S. citizen , 14 years after Chester A. Arthur was born ) . His mother , Malvina Stone Arthur , was a native of Berkshire , Vermont , who moved with her family to Quebec , where she met and married the future president 's father , William Arthur , on April 12 , 1821 . After the family had settled in Fairfield , Vermont , somewhere between 1822 and 1824 , William Arthur traveled with his eldest daughter to East Stanbridge , Canada , in October 1830 and commuted to Fairfield on Sundays to preach . `` It appears that he traveled regularly between the two villages , both of which were close to the Canada -- US border , for about eighteen months , holding two jobs '' , which may well explain the confusion about Chester A. Arthur 's place of birth , as perhaps did the fact that he was born in Franklin County , and thus within a day 's walk of the Vermont -- Quebec border . Moreover , Chester A. Arthur himself added a bit of confusion into the record by sometimes reporting his birth year as 1830 .
