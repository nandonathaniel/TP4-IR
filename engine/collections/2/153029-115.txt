The history of Scotland is known to have begun by the end of the last glacial period ( in the paleolithic ) , roughly 10,000 years ago . Prehistoric Scotland entered the Neolithic Era about 4000 BC , the Bronze Age about 2000 BC , and the Iron Age around 700 BC . Scotland 's recorded history began with the arrival of the Roman Empire in the 1st century , when the province of Britannia reached as far north as the Antonine Wall . North of this was Caledonia , inhabited by the Picti , whose uprisings forced Rome 's legions back to Hadrian 's Wall . As Rome finally withdrew from Britain , Gaelic raiders called the Scoti began colonising Western Scotland and Wales .
