Beer kegs are made of stainless steel , or less commonly , of aluminium . A keg has a single opening on one end , called a `` bung . '' A tube called a `` spear '' extends from the opening to the other end . There is a self - closing valve that is opened by the coupling fitting which is attached when the keg is tapped . There is also an opening at the top of the spear that allows gas ( usually carbon dioxide ) to drive the beer out of the keg . The coupling fitting has one or two valves that control the flow of beer out of and gas into the keg . The keg must be in the upright position , that is , with the opening on top , for the beer to be dispensed . Kegs can be contrasted to casks , which have two or more openings and no spear . Most major breweries now use internally speared kegs .
