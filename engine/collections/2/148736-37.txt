Asian American students are concentrated in a very small percentage of institutions , in only eight states ( and half concentrated in California , New York and Texas ) . Moreover , as more Asian Americans become Americanized and assimilated , more Asian American students are beginning to attend two - year community colleges ( 363,798 in 2000 ) than four - year public universities ( 354,564 in 2000 ) , and this trend of attending community college is accelerating . Unsurprisingly , West Coast academic institutions are amongst those that have the highest concentrations of Asian Americans .
