Experimental evidence reveals that the reaction of platinum with aqua regia is considerably more complex . The initial reactions produce a mixture of chloroplatinous acid ( H PtCl ) and nitrosoplatinic chloride ( ( NO ) PtCl ) . The nitrosoplatinic chloride is a solid product . If full dissolution of the platinum is desired , repeated extractions of the residual solids with concentrated hydrochloric acid must be performed .
