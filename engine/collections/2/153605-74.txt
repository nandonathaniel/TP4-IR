After the death of George IV in 1830 , a decision was made to close down the Menagerie . In 1831 , most of the stock was moved to the London Zoo which had opened in 1828 . The last of the animals left in 1835 , relocated to Regent 's Park . This decision was made after an incident , although sources vary as to the specifics : either a lion was accused of biting a soldier , or a sailor , Ensign Seymour , had been bitten by a monkey . The Menagerie buildings were removed in 1852 but the Keeper of the Royal Menagerie was entitled to use the Lion Tower as a house for life . Consequently , even though the animals had long since left the building , the tower was not demolished until the death of Copps , the last keeper , in 1853 .
