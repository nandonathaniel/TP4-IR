The New Apostolic Church is open toward the ecumenical movement . Contacts on local and institutional levels serve principally to facilitate better mutual acquaintance and to dismantle prejudices . Due to differences in doctrinal statements , it is not possible for the Church to participate in ecumenical divine services or acts of blessing . The New Apostolic Church has reinforced its efforts to cultivate good neighbourly relationships with other churches and denominations . This occurs primarily through invitations to both the community and church congregations for special events , and through combined benefit events for charitable purposes . The question as to whether this may lead to membership status in the ecumenical movement can not be answered at this time .
