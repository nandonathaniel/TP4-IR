The early Australian IWW used a number of tactics from the US , including free speech fights . However , there early appeared significant differences of practice between the Australian IWW and its US parent ; the Australian IWW tended to co-operate where possible with existing unions rather than forming its own , and in contrast with the US body took an extremely open and forthright stand against involvement in World War One . The IWW cooperated with many other unions , encouraging industrial unionism and militancy . In particular , the IWW 's strategies had a large effect on the Australasian Meat Industry Employees Union . The AMIEU established closed shops and workers councils and effectively regulated management behaviour toward the end of the 1910s .
