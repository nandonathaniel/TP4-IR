The Israeli force of four infantry brigades was commanded by Moshe Carmel . The entire operation lasted just 60 hours , during which numerous villages were captured , often after locals or Arab forces put up resistance . Arab losses were estimated at 400 dead and 550 taken prisoner , with low Israeli casualties .
