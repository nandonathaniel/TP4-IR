In 2011 , to promote her latest film Vampires Suck , Anneliese van der Pol revealed in an interview that a That 's So Raven film had been written but failed to go into production . `` The storyline saw us going to France . ( Raven ) was going to start a fashion line in France . Eddie and ( Chelsea ) were going to fly out and meet her . Of course , something tragic happens . We have to rescue the situation . '' Van der Pol admitted that Raven 's schedule at the time was booked solid for a year and the possibility of the film seemed unlikely . `` But no , It 's not ever happening . If I hear something , I will be the first to sign on . '' She also commented on reprising her role of Chelsea Daniels .
