Mark Wilson Jones has attempted to explain the design adjustments carried out in relating the porch to the dome , arguing that the Pantheon 's porch was originally designed for monolithic granite columns with shafts 50 Roman feet tall ( weighing about 100 tons ) and capitals 10 Roman feet tall in the Corinthian style . The taller porch would have hidden the second pediment visible on the intermediate block . Instead , after the intended columns failed to arrive , the builders made many awkward adjustments in order to use shafts 40 Roman feet tall and capitals eight Roman feet tall . This substitution was probably a result of logistical difficulties at some stage in the construction . The grey granite columns that were actually used in the Pantheon 's pronaos were quarried in Egypt at Mons Claudianus in the eastern mountains . Each was 39 feet ( 11.9 m ) tall , 5 feet ( 1.5 m ) in diameter , and 60 tons in weight . These were dragged more than 100 km ( 62 miles ) from the quarry to the river on wooden sledges . They were floated by barge down the Nile River when the water level was high during the spring floods , and then transferred to vessels to cross the Mediterranean Sea to the Roman port of Ostia . There , they were transferred back onto barges and pulled up the Tiber River to Rome . After being unloaded near the Mausoleum of Augustus , the site of the Pantheon was still about 700 metres away . Thus , it was necessary to either drag them or to move them on rollers to the construction site .
