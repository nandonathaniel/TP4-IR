Hay is very sensitive to weather conditions , especially when it is harvested . In drought conditions , both seed and leaf production are stunted , making hay that has a high ratio of dry coarse stems that have very low nutritional values . If the weather is too wet , the cut hay may spoil in the field before it can be baled . Thus the biggest challenge and risk for farmers in producing hay crops is the weather , especially the weather of the particular few weeks when the plants are at the best age / maturity for hay . A lucky break in the weather often moves the haymaking tasks ( such as mowing , tedding , and baling ) to the top priority on the farm 's to - do list . This is reflected in the idiom to make hay while the sun shines . Hay that was too wet at cutting may develop rot and mold after being baled , creating the potential for toxins to form in the feed , which could make the animals sick .
