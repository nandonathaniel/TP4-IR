The surfboard fin , or keel , is the part of the back of a surfboard that enters the water . Similar to a rudder on a boat the surfboard fin works to steer the board and provide stability . The surfboard fin prevents a surfer from uncontrollably spinning in circles while trying to ride a wave . The surfboard fin was invented by Tom Blake in 1935 .
