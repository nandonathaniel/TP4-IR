Bobby Cannavale as Paxton : A San Francisco Police Department officer who is engaged to Lang 's former wife Maggie . Cannavale stated that Rudd and McKay convinced him to join the film during the rewriting process before Marvel approached him , saying , `` They sort of pumped ( my ) part up a bit ... I really went on good faith ( taking the role ) because they 're so secretive ( at Marvel ) about the script . I just trusted them . '' He also added that the process felt like an indie film instead of a large - scale blockbuster , and that he was able to improvise frequently along with the other actors . Patrick Wilson was originally cast in the role , before leaving the film because of scheduling conflicts brought on by the filming delay .
