Sugar was found in Europe by the 1st century CE , but only as an imported medicine , and not as a food . The Greek physician Pedanius Dioscorides in the 1st century CE described sugar in his medical treatise De Materia Medica , and Pliny the Elder , a 1st - century CE Roman , described sugar in his Natural History : `` Sugar is made in Arabia as well , but Indian sugar is better . It is a kind of honey found in cane , white as gum , and it crunches between the teeth . It comes in lumps the size of a hazelnut . Sugar is used only for medical purposes . ''
