Grades 11 and 12 are considered as higher secondary level . Higher Secondary Education Board ( HSEB ) supervises higher secondary schools which are mostly under private management . Previously these grades were under the university system and were run as proficiency certificate level . Though some universities still offer these programs , the policy now is to integrate these grades into the school system. These class starts from late July and ends in April .
