However , the Blazers continued to struggle in the post-season , and in 1986 , Ramsay was fired and replaced with Mike Schuler . Despite this , they were the only team to beat the Boston Celtics on the road that season . That following off - season , the team drafted two players from behind the Iron Curtain , Arvydas Sabonis and Dražen Petrović , and sent Thompson to the San Antonio Spurs for former Oregon State University star Steve Johnson . Johnson was a high - scoring forward - center who the team intended to pair with Bowie on the frontline . It was not to be , as Bowie broke his leg five games into the 1986 -- 87 season , missing the next two and a half seasons . During Schuler 's brief tenure , the Blazers failed to advance out of the first round of the NBA playoffs .
