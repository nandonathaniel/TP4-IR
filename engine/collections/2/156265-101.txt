In South Africa the Supreme Court of Appeal , beginning with the landmark ruling in KPMG Chartered Accountants ( SA ) v Securefin Ltd , redefined the rules relating to the admissibility of evidence that may be used in the interpretation of contracts in South Africa and in Dexgroup ( Pty ) Ltd v Trustco Group International ( Pty ) Ltd the Supreme Court of Appeal gave further clarity on these rules . The starting point is the language of the document and the parol evidence rule prevents evidence to add to , detract from or modify the words contained in the document . However , evidence to prove the meaning of the words , expressions , sentences and terms that constitute the contract , is admissible from the outset irrespective of whether there is any uncertainty or ambiguity in the text -- as long as the evidence concerned points to a meaning which the text can reasonably have and the evidence is relevant to prove the common intention of the parties .
