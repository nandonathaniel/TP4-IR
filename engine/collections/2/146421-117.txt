To protect and support the multitude of ships sailing for maritime interests into the waters of the East China Sea and Yellow Sea ( to Korea and Japan ) , Southeast Asia , the Indian Ocean , and the Red Sea , it was necessary to establish an official standing navy . The Song dynasty therefore established China 's first permanent navy in 1132 , with a headquarters at Dinghai . With a permanent navy , the Song were prepared to face the naval forces of the Jin on the Yangtze River in 1161 , in the Battle of Tangdao and the Battle of Caishi . During these battles the Song navy employed swift paddle wheel driven naval vessels armed with traction trebuchet catapults aboard the decks that launched gunpowder bombs . Although the Jin forces commanded by Wanyan Liang ( the Prince of Hailing ) boasted 70,000 men on 600 warships , and the Song forces only 3,000 men on 120 warships , the Song dynasty forces were victorious in both battles due to the destructive power of the bombs and the rapid assaults by paddle wheel ships . The strength of the navy was heavily emphasized after that . A century after the navy was founded it had grown in size to 52,000 fighting marines .
