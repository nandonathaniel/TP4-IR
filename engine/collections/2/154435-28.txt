Chromosome characteristics determine the genetic sex of a fetus at conception . This is specifically based on the 23rd pair of chromosomes that is inherited . Since the mother 's egg contains an X chromosome and the father 's sperm contains either an X or Y chromosome , it is the male who determines the fetus 's sex . If the fetus inherits the X chromosome from the father , the fetus will be a female . In this case , testosterone is not made and the Wolffian duct will degrade thus , the Müllerian duct will develop into female sex organs . The clitoris is the remnants of the Wolffian duct . On the other hand , if the fetus inherits the Y chromosome from the father , the fetus will be a male . The presence of testosterone will stimulate the Wolffian duct which will bring about the development of the male sex organs and the Müllerian duct will degrade .
