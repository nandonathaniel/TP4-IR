The basic concept of significant figures is often used in connection with rounding . Rounding to significant figures is a more general - purpose technique than rounding to n decimal places , since it handles numbers of different scales in a uniform way . For example , the population of a city might only be known to the nearest thousand and be stated as 52,000 , while the population of a country might only be known to the nearest million and be stated as 52,000,000 . The former might be in error by hundreds , and the latter might be in error by hundreds of thousands , but both have two significant figures ( 5 and 2 ) . This reflects the fact that the significance of the error ( its likely size relative to the size of the quantity being measured ) is the same in both cases .
