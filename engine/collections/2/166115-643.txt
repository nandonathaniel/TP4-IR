a trial within a trial , or ( in America ) jury selection ( Law French ) . Literally `` to speak the truth . '' ( Anglo - Norman voir ( truth ) is etymologically unrelated to the modern French voir ( to see ) . ) In modern American court procedure , the examination of prospective jurors for their qualification to serve , including inherent biases , views and predelictions ; during this examination , each prospective juror must `` speak the truth '' so that counsel and the court may decide whether they should remain on the jury or be excused . In England and Wales , the expression is used to refer to a `` trial within a trial , '' during which a judge hears evidence in the absence of the jury , typically to decide whether a certain piece of evidence should be allowed to be presented to the jury or not . For example , a judge might hold a `` voir dire '' to determine whether a confession has been extracted from a defendant by an unfair inducement in order to decide whether the jury should hear evidence of the confession or not .
