Caligari was a critical success in France , but French filmmakers were divided in their opinions after its release . Abel Gance called it `` superb '' and wrote , `` What a lesson to all directors ! '' and René Clair said `` overthrew the realist dogma '' of filmmaking . Film critic and director Louis Delluc said the film has a compelling rhythm : `` At first slow , deliberately laborious , it attempts to irritate . Then when the zigzag motifs of the fairground start turning , the pace leaps forward , agitato , accelerando , and leaves off only at the word ' End ' , as abruptly as a slap in the face . '' Jean Epstein , however , called it `` a prize example of the abuse of décor in the cinema '' and said it `` represents a grave sickness of cinema '' . Likewise , Jean Cocteau called it `` the first step towards a grave error which consists of flat photography of eccentric decors , instead of obtaining surprise by means of the camera '' . French critic Frédéric - Philippe Amiguet wrote of the film : `` It has the odor of tainted food . It leaves a taste of cinders in the mouth . '' The Russian director Sergei Eisenstein especially disliked Caligari , calling it a `` combination of silent hysteria , partially coloured canvases , daubed flats , painted faces , and the unnatural broken gestures and action of monstrous chimaeras '' .
