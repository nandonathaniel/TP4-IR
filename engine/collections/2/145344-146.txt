Matilda had been the pre-Award season favorite , but as the season progressed , it became clear that Kinky Boots and the revival of Pippin would provide serious competition . Early in the 2013 awards season , Kinky Boots did well , receiving Drama League Award nominations for Distinguished Production of a Musical and Distinguished Performance , for both Porter and Sands , and winning for Distinguished Production . The show received nine Outer Critics Circle Award nominations , winning three , including Outstanding New Broadway Musical , Outstanding New Score and Outstanding Actor in a Musical ( Porter ) . The musical received only two Drama Desk Award nominations , however , and only one win : Porter for Outstanding Actor in a Musical . New York Times theatre writer Patrick Healy , however , reported that some Tony voters found Matilda `` dark '' and `` a bit chilly '' , and accurately predicted that `` while the cleverness of Matilda may be enough to win best book , the warmth of Kinky Boots will be enough to score an upset and take the top Tony for best musical .
