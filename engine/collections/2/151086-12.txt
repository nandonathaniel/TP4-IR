Tapeats Sandstone averages 525 million years old and is made of medium - to coarse - grained sand and conglomerate that was deposited on an ancient shore ( see 3a in figure 1 ) . Ripple marks are common in the upper members of this dark brown thin - bedded layer . Fossils and imprint trails of trilobites and brachiopods have also been found in the Tapeats . Today it is a cliff - former that is 100 to 325 feet ( 30 to 100 m ) thick . Bright Angel Shale averages 515 million years old and is made of mudstone - derived shale that is interbedded with small sections of sandstone and shaly limestone with a few thin beds of dolomite . It was mostly deposited as mud just offshore and contains brachiopod , trilobite , and worm fossils ( see 3b in figure 1 ) . The color of this formation is mostly various shades of green with some brownish - tan to gray parts . It is a slope - former and is 270 to 450 feet ( 82 to 137 m ) thick . Glauconite is responsible for the green coloration of the Bright Angel . Muav Limestone averages 505 million years old and is made of gray , thin - bedded limestone that was deposited farther offshore from calcium carbonate precipitates ( see 3c in figure 1 ) . The western part of the canyon has a much thicker sequence of Muav than the eastern part . The Muav is a cliff - former , 136 to 827 feet ( 41 to 252 m ) thick .
