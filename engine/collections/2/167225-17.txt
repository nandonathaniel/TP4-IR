The re-opening of the insurance sector began during the early 1990s . In 1993 , the government set up a committee chaired by former Reserve Bank of India governor R.N. Malhotra to propose recommendations for insurance reform complementing those initiated in the financial sector . The committee submitted its report in 1994 , recommending that the private sector be permitted to enter the insurance industry . Foreign companies should enter by floating Indian companies , preferably as joint ventures with Indian partners .
