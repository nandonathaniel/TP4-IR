Magnetic declination varies both from place to place and with the passage of time . As a traveller cruises the east coast of the United States , for example , the declination varies from 16 degrees west in Maine , to 6 in Florida , to 0 degrees in Louisiana , to 4 degrees east ( in Texas ) . The declination at London , UK is one degree 7 minutes west ( 2014 ) , and as the country is quite small that figure is fairly good for the whole of the country . It is reducing , and scientists predict that in about 2050 it will be zero .
