Colombia 's geographic and climatic variations have combined to produce relatively well - defined `` ethnocultural '' groups among different regions of the country : the Costeño from the Caribbean coast ; the Caucano in the Cauca region and the Pacific coast ; the Antioqueño in Antioquia , Caldas , Risaralda , and Valle del Cauca departments ; the Tolimense in Tolima and Huila departments ; the Cundiboyacense in the interior departments of Cundinamarca and Boyacá in the Cordillera Oriental ; the Santandereano in Norte de Santander and Santander departments ; and the Llanero in the eastern plains . Each group has distinctive characteristics , accents , customs , social patterns , and forms of cultural adaptation to climate and topography that differentiates it from other groups . Even with rapid urbanization and modernization , regionalism and regional identification continued to be important reference points , although they were somewhat less prominent in the 1980s than in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries .
