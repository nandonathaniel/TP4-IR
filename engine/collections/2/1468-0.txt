The Arctic Circle is the most northerly of the five major circles of latitude as shown on maps of Earth . It marks the northernmost point at which the noon sun is just visible on the December solstice and the southernmost point at which the midnight sun is just visible on the June solstice . The region north of this circle is known as the Arctic , and the zone just to the south is called the Northern Temperate Zone .
