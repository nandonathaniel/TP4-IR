The coffee cherries are spread out in the sun , either on large concrete or brick patios or on matting raised to waist height on trestles . As the cherries dry , they are raked or turned by hand to ensure even drying and prevent mildew . It may take up to 4 weeks before the cherries are dried to the optimum moisture content , depending on the weather conditions . On larger plantations , machine - drying is sometimes used to speed up the process after the coffee has been pre-dried in the sun for a few days .
