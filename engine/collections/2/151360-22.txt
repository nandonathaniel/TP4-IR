The process of Cherokee removal took place in three stages . It began with the voluntary removal of those in favor of the treaty , who were willing to accept government support and move west on their own in the two years after the signing of the Treaty of New Echota in 1835 . Most of the Cherokee , including Chief John Ross , were outraged and unwilling to move , and they reacted with opposition . They did not believe the government would take any action against them if they elected to stay . However , the U.S. army was sent in , and the forced removal stage began . The Cherokee were herded violently into internment camps , where they were kept for the summer of 1838 . The actual transportation west was delayed by intense heat and drought , but in the fall , the Cherokee reluctantly agreed to transport themselves west under the supervision of Chief Ross in the reluctant removal stage .
