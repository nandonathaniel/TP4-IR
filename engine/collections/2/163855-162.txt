After the end of the Gemini program , the Soviets Union began flying their second - generation Zond manned spacecraft in 1967 with the ultimate goal of looping a cosmonaut around the Moon and returning him immediately to Earth . The Zond spacecraft was launched with the simpler and already operational Proton launch rocket , unlike the parallel Soviet manned Moon landing effort also underway at the time based on third - generation Soyuz spacecraft requiring development of the advanced N - 1 booster . The Soviets thus believed they could achieve a manned Zond circumlunar flight years before a U.S. manned lunar landing and so score a propaganda victory . However , significant development problems delayed the Zond program and the success of the U.S. Apollo lunar landing program led to the eventual termination of the Zond effort .
