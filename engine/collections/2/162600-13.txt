Structure and agency forms an enduring debate in social theory : `` Do social structures determine an individual 's behaviour or does human agency ? '' In this context ' agency ' refers to the capacity of individuals to act independently and make free choices , whereas ' structure ' refers to factors which limit or affect the choices and actions of individuals ( such as social class , religion , gender , ethnicity , and so on ) . Discussions over the primacy of structure or agency relate to the very core of social ontology ( `` What is the social world made of ? '' , `` What is a cause in the social world , and what is an effect ? '' ) . One attempt to reconcile postmodern critiques with the overarching project of social science has been the development , particularly in Britain , of critical realism . For critical realists such as Roy Bhaskar , traditional positivism commits an ' epistemic fallacy ' by failing to address the ontological conditions which make science possible : that is , structure and agency itself .
