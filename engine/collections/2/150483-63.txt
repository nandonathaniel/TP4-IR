Gold mine production in Africa is expected to increase by 17 % from 2005 to 2009 . The long - term decline in South Africa 's production could be reversed because of the expected completion of the Moab Khotsong mine in 2006 , the Dominion Mine in 2007 , the Tshepong Decline project in 2008 , the Phakisa Shaft in 2009 , and the planned expansion of the Masimong Mine in 2010 . By 2011 , these projects could more than offset the shutdown of the Ergo and the North West Mines in 2005 , the planned closure of the Crown Mine in 2009 , and lower production from the Great Noligwa , the Kopanang , and the Tau Lekoa Mines .
