The Marshal of the Soviet Union ( Маршал Советского Союза ) rank was introduced on 22 September 1935 . On 7 May 1940 further modifications to rationalise the system of ranks were made on the proposal by Marshal Voroshilov : the ranks of `` General '' and `` Admiral '' replaced the senior functional ranks of Combrig , Comdiv , Comcor , Comandarm in the RKKA and Flagman 1st rank etc. in the Red Navy ; the other senior functional ranks ( `` division commissar , '' `` division engineer , '' etc . ) remained unaffected . The arm or service distinctions remained ( e.g. general of cavalry , marshal of armoured troops ) . For the most part the new system restored that used by the Imperial Russian Army at the conclusion of its participation in World War I .
