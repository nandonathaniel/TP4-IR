The for - loop , written as ( initial ) ( increment ) ( limit ) ( ... ) for initialises an internal variable , executes the body as long as the internal variable is not more than limit ( or not less , if increment is negative ) and , at the end of each iteration , increments the internal variable . Before each iteration , the value of the internal variable is pushed onto the stack .
