The day most commonly referred to as the `` New Year '' is 1 Tishrei , which actually begins in the seventh month of the ecclesiastical year . On that day the formal New Year for the counting of years ( such as Shmita and Yovel ) , Rosh Hashanah ( `` head of the year '' ) is observed . ( see Ezekiel 40 : 1 , which uses the phrase `` beginning of the year '' . ) This is the civil new year , and the date on which the year number advances . Certain agricultural practices are also marked from this date .
