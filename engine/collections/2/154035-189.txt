The present - day Atlantic gateway , i.e. the Strait of Gibraltar , originated in the early Pliocene via the Zanclean Flood . As mentioned , two other gateways preceded Gibraltar : the Betic Corridor across southern Spain and the Rifian Corridor across northern Morocco . The former gateway closed about six ( 6 ) mya , causing the Messinian salinity crisis ( MSC ) ; the latter or possibly both gateways closed during the earlier Tortonian times , causing a `` Tortonian salinity crisis '' ( from 11.6 to 7.2 mya ) , which occurred well before the MSC and lasted much longer . Both `` crises '' resulted in broad connections of the mainlands of Africa and Europe , which thereby normalised migrations of flora and fauna -- especially large mammals including primates -- between the two continents . The Vallesian crisis indicates a typical extinction and replacement of mammal species in Europe during Tortonian times following climatic upheaval and overland migrations of new species ; see Animation : Messinian salinity crisis ( and mammal migrations ) , at right .
