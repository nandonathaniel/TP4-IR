Sri Krishna is considered as the one of the most powerful human incarnations of the Lord Vishnu . He was born around 5,200 years ago in Mathura . The sole objective of Sri Krishna 's birth was to free the Earth from the evilness of demons . He played an important role in Mahabharata and propagated the theory of bhakti and good karma which are narrated deeply in the Bhagwat Geeta . Sri Krishna was born in a prison in the custody of Kansa . Vasudev , His father immediately thought of his friend Nand and decided to hand over his child to him to save Krishna from the clutch of Kansa . Krishna grew up in Gokul and finally killed his uncle , King Kansa . The actual celebration of Janmashtami takes place during the midnight as Sri Krishna is believed to be born on a dark , stormy and windy night to end the rule and violence of his uncle , Kansa . All over India this day is celebrated with devotional songs and dances , pujas , arti , blowing of the Conch and rocking the cradle of baby Sri Krishna . The Janmashtami celebration of Mathura and Vrindavan , the places where Sri Krishna had spent his life , are very special . On this day temples and homes are wonderfully decorated and illuminated . Night long prayers are offered and religious mantras are sung in the temples .
