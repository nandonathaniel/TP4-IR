On June 16 , 2011 , it was announced that the double - elimination format had been modified . The pools were eliminated , with the eight U.S. teams continuing to compete in one bracket and the eight International teams in another bracket . The tournament remains double - elimination until the U.S. and International Championship games , where it becomes single - elimination . ( That is , if the team that advances through the winner 's bracket loses the championship game they are eliminated and the teams do not play a rubber game . ) Each team still plays a minimum of three games , playing a `` crossover '' ( U.S. vs. International ) consolation game if eliminated after their second game .
