Baroreceptors are stretch receptors located in the aortic sinus , carotid bodies , the venae cavae , and other locations , including pulmonary vessels and the right side of the heart itself . Baroreceptors fire at a rate determined by how much they are stretched , which is influenced by blood pressure , level of physical activity , and the relative distribution of blood . With increased pressure and stretch , the rate of baroreceptor firing increases , and the cardiac centers decrease sympathetic stimulation and increase parasympathetic stimulation . As pressure and stretch decrease , the rate of baroreceptor firing decreases , and the cardiac centers increase sympathetic stimulation and decrease parasympathetic stimulation . There is a similar reflex , called the atrial reflex or Bainbridge reflex , associated with varying rates of blood flow to the atria . Increased venous return stretches the walls of the atria where specialized baroreceptors are located . However , as the atrial baroreceptors increase their rate of firing and as they stretch due to the increased blood pressure , the cardiac center responds by increasing sympathetic stimulation and inhibiting parasympathetic stimulation to increase heart rate . The opposite is also true . Chemoreceptors present in the carotid body or adjacent to the aorta in an aortic body respond to the blood 's oxygen , carbon dioxide levels . Low oxygen or high carbon dioxide will stimulate firing of the receptors .
