In the Xi Jinping era , some commentators and political observers dubbed the loose political grouping of former security chief Zhou Yongkang , former Central Military Commission vice-chairman Xu Caihou , former Chongqing party chief Bo Xilai , and former General Office chief Ling Jihua as the `` New Gang of Four '' . All four were investigated for corruption - related offences between 2012 and 2014 . This group had little in common with the original Gang of Four and whether the new `` Gang '' truly had a coherent set of shared political interests was not clear .
