Technology solutions can also completely prevent skimming ( credit card fraud ) by agents . At the point in the transaction where the agent needs to collect the credit card information , the call can be transferred to an Interactive Voice Response system . This protects the sensitive information , but can create an awkward customer interaction . Solutions such as own not automation allow the agent to capture the credit card information without ever seeing or hearing it . The agent remains on the phone and customers enter their credit card information directly into the customer relationship management software using the keypad of their phone . Agent - assisted automation can stumble however if callers read back the digits as they enter them . DTMF tones are suppressed entirely or converted to monotones so the agent can not recognize them and so that they can not be recorded . Some secure payment platforms allows for the masking of the DTMF tones , but are still recorded as DTMF tones by the on - site or hosted call recorders . Traditionally the only way to suppress DTMF tones is to intercept the call at the trunk using sophisticated servers and call cards to do so . This way allows for the suppression or masking of the DTMF tones to the call recorder , as well as the agent .
