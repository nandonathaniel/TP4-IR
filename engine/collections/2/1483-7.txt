The Underground Railroad was a network of secret routes and safe houses established in the United States during the early - to - mid 19th century , and used by African - American slaves to escape into free states and Canada with the aid of abolitionists and allies who were sympathetic to their cause . The term is also applied to the abolitionists , both black and white , free and enslaved , who aided the fugitives . Various other routes led to Mexico or overseas . An earlier escape route running south toward Florida , then a Spanish possession ( except 1763 -- 83 ) , existed from the late 17th century until Florida became a United States territory in 1821 ( and ending the safe haven for escaped slaves was the main reason it changed nationality ) . However , the network now generally known as the Underground Railroad was formed in the late 1700s , and reached its height between 1850 and 1860 . One estimate suggests that by 1850 , 100,000 slaves had escaped via the `` Railroad '' .
