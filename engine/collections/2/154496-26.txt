When Walt is kidnapped by Mexican drug kingpin Tuco Salamanca ( Raymond Cruz ) , his family -- unaware of the connection to Walt 's criminal activities -- organizes a search for him as a missing person . When Walt escapes , he fakes a `` fugue state '' , claiming to have no memory of the last few days . The marriage continues going downhill thanks to Walt 's continued absences , devolving to the point where Skyler refuses to speak to him . Skyler is also perturbed by Walt 's resistance to his son 's efforts to raise money for Walt 's cancer treatments , unaware that most of the donations actually constitute drug money laundered by Walt 's corrupt lawyer , Saul Goodman ( Bob Odenkirk ) .
