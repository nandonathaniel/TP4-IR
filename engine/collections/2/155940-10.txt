Bubble teas are typically of two distinct types : fruit - flavored teas and milk teas . Some shops offer hybrid fruit milk teas . Most milk teas include powdered dairy or non-dairy creamers , but some shops offer fresh milk as an alternative . Other varieties are 100 % crushed - fruit smoothies with tapioca pearls and signature ice cream shakes made from local sources . Many American bubble tea vendors sell milk smoothies , which are similar to bubble tea but do not contain any tea ingredients . Some small caf√©s offer sweetener substitutes such as honey , agave , stevia , and aspartame upon request .
