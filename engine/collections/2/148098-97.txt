Hockey in South Africa has been played for decades , mainly by the white minority . Like most other sports , South Africa was banned from international Hockey from 1964 onwards . In August 1992 , the South African Hockey Association was formed , with the aims of `` Creat ( ing ) opportunities for participation without distinction based on colour , race , creed , religion or gender '' and to `` Redress historical disparities to allow all to participate and compete equally and specifically address the needs of historically disadvantaged communities through special programmes . '' As a result , South Africa was allowed to take part in international competitions from 1993 onwards , including the Hockey Africa Cup of Nations , a trophy that has been won every time since by both the South African Men 's Hockey team and the South African Women 's Hockey team .
