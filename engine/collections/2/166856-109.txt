All states allow news reporters to be execution witnesses for information of the general public , except Wyoming which allow only witnesses authorized by the condemned . Several states also allow victims ' families and relatives selected by the prisoner to watch executions . An hour or two before the execution , the condemned is offered religious services and to choose his last meal ( except in Texas which abolished it in 2011 ) .
