The season is structured into three `` pods '' based on its airing schedule : the first eight episodes , subtitled Ghost Rider ; LMD ( Life Model Decoy ) for the subsequent seven episodes ; and a third pod for the final seven episodes called Agents of Hydra . Elements and characters cross over between the different pods , but the sections `` definitely have a different feel '' from one another , as Tancharoen explained that 22 episodes `` is a long time to hold a big bad or a single plot line , especially for an audience '' , and for the past two seasons , the series was able to have two separated halves that `` allows us to introduce a big bad . And then , something happens and we rise somebody new ... Now , there 's three of those . '' `` Financial considerations '' were also taken into account in creating the pods for the season , as using LMDs does not `` cost as much as setting a guy 's head on fire via CGI '' . In terms of writing the `` complicated season '' , Whedon said the writers were `` aware that our fans are our fans and have spent some time with these characters and are clever and see things coming sometimes ... Part of our job is to create not just what we are presenting on plot , but letting the audience be one step ahead of us and being one step ahead of that . '' He added that the writers knew that they wanted to tell a Ghost Rider story , an LMD story , and a `` what if '' scenario , and the hardest part was making each pod still fit together as a single season . The major connection ultimately became the Darkhold , which leads from the magic of Ghost Rider to the advanced science of LMD and then the Framework in Agents of Hydra . Ghost Rider also reappears in the final episode of the season , `` World 's End '' , as an additional connection .
