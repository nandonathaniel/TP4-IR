Marshall desired to improve the mathematical rigour of economics and transform it into a more scientific profession . In the 1870s he wrote a small number of tracts on international trade and the problems of protectionism . In 1879 , many of these works were compiled into a work entitled The Theory of Foreign Trade : The Pure Theory of Domestic Values . In the same year ( 1879 ) he published The Economics of Industry with his wife Mary Paley .
