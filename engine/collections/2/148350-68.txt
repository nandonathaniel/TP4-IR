While the United States had developed plans for an air campaign against Japan prior to the Pacific War , the capture of Allied bases in the western Pacific in the first weeks of the conflict meant that this offensive did not begin until mid-1944 when the long - ranged Boeing B - 29 Superfortress became ready for use in combat . Operation Matterhorn involved India - based B - 29s staging through bases around Chengdu in China to make a series of raids on strategic targets in Japan . This effort failed to achieve the strategic objectives that its planners had intended , largely because of logistical problems , the bomber 's mechanical difficulties , the vulnerability of Chinese staging bases , and the extreme range required to reach key Japanese cities .
