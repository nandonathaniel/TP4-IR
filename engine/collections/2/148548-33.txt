In some English schools , Manchester Grammar School for example , nude swimming was compulsory until the 1970s . It was discontinued when it started admitting girls . This was also the case for some American high schools . and junior high schools and in some summer camps . John Torney in his 1937 article on Swimming and Lifesaving programs for summer camps wrote that boys and girls enjoy the thrill of swimming nude and costumes can be discarded for a night swim . A 2006 Roper poll showed that 25 % of all American adults had been skinny dipping at least once , and that 74 % believed nude swimming should be tolerated at accepted locations .
