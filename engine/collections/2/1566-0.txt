The Plagues of Egypt ( Hebrew : מכות מצרים , Makot Mitzrayim ) , also called the ten biblical plagues , were ten calamities that , according to the biblical Book of Exodus , God inflicted upon Egypt to persuade the Pharaoh to release the ill - treated Israelites from slavery . The Pharaoh capitulated after the tenth plague , until which God had prevented him from being swayed , triggering the Exodus of the Hebrew people .
