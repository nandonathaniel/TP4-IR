At 3 : 00 a.m. on February 27 , 1836 , Urrea 's advance patrol surprised Johnson and about 45 men , initiating the Battle of San Patricio , where Urrea 's force killed 16 and took 24 prisoners . Johnson and four others escaped in the darkness and rejoined Fannin 's command at Goliad where they retold a story , which they first told at a ranch where they had taken refuge after the escape , that all the prisoners had been executed . Urrea had sent 18 of the prisoners to Matamoros where they were sentenced to death but were later released . This news persuaded Fannin to abandon any further attempt to send relief to the Alamo or to try to secure badly needed supplies waiting at Matagorda but to prepare Presidio La Bah√≠a at Goliad for defense against the advancing Mexican Army .
