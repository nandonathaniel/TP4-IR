The river 's source is from the Bow Glacier , which is part of the Wapta Icefield . The outflow from this source flows into Bow Lake in the Canadian Rockies . It flows south to the village of Lake Louise then turns east and flows through the town of Banff then through Canmore . The Ghost Lake reservoir is formed upstream from the town of Cochrane . The Bow then flows eastward to the city of Calgary ; it continues on to form the South Saskatchewan River when the Bow joins with the Oldman River near Grassy Lake in southern Alberta . Its waters are further shed in the Hudson Bay through the Saskatchewan River , Lake Winnipeg , and Nelson River .
