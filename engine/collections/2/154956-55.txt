The study of lymphatic drainage of various organs is important in the diagnosis , prognosis , and treatment of cancer . The lymphatic system , because of its closeness to many tissues of the body , is responsible for carrying cancerous cells between the various parts of the body in a process called metastasis . The intervening lymph nodes can trap the cancer cells . If they are not successful in destroying the cancer cells the nodes may become sites of secondary tumors .
