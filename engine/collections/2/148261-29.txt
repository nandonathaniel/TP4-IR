The album tells the story of Rael , a half Puerto Rican youth living in New York City who experiences several bizarre situations and characters . Gabriel chose to develop a character that is the least likely person to `` fall into all this pansy claptrap '' , and aimed for a story that contrasted between fantasy and character . He explained that as the story progresses , Rael finds that he is not as `` butch '' as he hoped and his experiences eventually brings out a more romantic side to his personality . The ending to the story is not directly clear as Gabriel deliberately left the ending of the story ambiguous . When asked about it , Gabriel does not declare that Rael dies , though he compared the ending to the buildup of suspense and drama in a film as `` you never see what 's so terrifying because they leave it up in the air without ... labelling it '' . Several of the story 's occurrences and settings derived from Gabriel 's dreams . Collins remarked the entire concept was about split personality . The individual songs also make satirical allusions to mythology , the sexual revolution , advertising , and consumerism .
