Daemon allows Ball to prove his innocence in trial by combat , in which Ser Glendon soundly defeats Daemon . By this time a large army under the King 's Hand Brynden Rivers encircles Whitewalls , and Daemon is captured . Dunk and Egg meet Bloodraven , and Egg demands that Bloodraven reward Glendon , Duncan , and the other hedge knights . For surrendering to Bloodraven without a fight , Lord Butterwell is spared his life and allowed a tenth of his wealth ; but his fortress is forfeit to the Iron Throne and torn down . Bloodraven , at Egg 's request , gives Dunk the gold to ransom his armor . When Dunk asks Bloodraven what became of the dragon egg , Bloodraven tells Dunk it was taken by an agent of his ( implied to be one of the performing dwarfs at the wedding ) .
