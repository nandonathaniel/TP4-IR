All ships of the class are powered by two A4W nuclear reactors , housed in separate compartments . They power four propeller shafts and can produce a maximum speed of over 30 knots ( 56 km / h ) and maximum power of 260,000 bhp ( 190 MW ) . The reactors produce heat through nuclear fission which heats water . This is then passed through four turbines which are shared by the two reactors . The turbines power the four bronze propellers , each with a diameter of 25 feet ( 7.6 m ) and a weight of 66,000 pounds ( 30 t ) . Behind these are the two rudders which are 29 feet ( 8.8 m ) high and 22 feet ( 6.7 m ) long , and each weigh 110,000 pounds ( 50 metric tons ) .
