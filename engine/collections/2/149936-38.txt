In the first letter to Tacitus his nephew suggested that his death was due to the reaction of his weak lungs to a cloud of poisonous , sulphurous gas that wafted over the group . However , Stabiae was 16 km ( 9.9 mi ) from the vent ( roughly where the modern town of Castellammare di Stabia is situated ) and his companions were apparently unaffected by the fumes , and so it is more likely that the corpulent Pliny died from some other cause , such as a stroke or heart attack . An asthmatic attack is also not out of the question . His body was found with no apparent injuries on the next day , after dispersal of the plume .
