Conte used his press conference to reiterate the need for Chelsea to strengthen their squad ahead of the new season : `` We have a small squad , I think only one player is not enough to improve our team . We need more players that are not top level like Neymar , but we need to improve our squad . '' He spoke of the importance of winning the fixture as it presented the first trophy of the season and hoped the spectators would see a `` good game '' against Arsenal . Conte confirmed Eden Hazard and Tiémoué Bakayoko were ruled out of the match with injuries and confirmed Victor Moses would play ; the right - wing - back was sent off in the cup final and his one - match suspension carried over to the new season . Following a review by the FA in August , Moses was made available for the Community Shield fixture , but served a ban against Burnley on the opening weekend of the Premier League season .
