Diabetes is a metabolic disorder where the body is unable to regulate levels of glucose in the blood either because of a lack of insulin in the body or the failure , by cells in the body , to respond properly to insulin . Each of these situations can be caused by persistently high elevations of blood glucose levels , through pancreatic burnout and insulin resistance . The pancreas is the organ responsible for the secretion of insulin . Insulin is a hormone that regulates glucose levels , allowing the body 's cells to absorb and use glucose . Without it , glucose can not enter the cell and therefore can not be used as fuel for the body 's functions . If the pancreas is exposed to persistently high elevations of blood glucose levels , the insulin - producing cells in the pancreas could be damaged , causing a lack of insulin in the body . Insulin resistance occurs when the pancreas tries to produce more and more insulin in response to persistently elevated blood glucose levels . Eventually , the rest of the body becomes resistant to the insulin that the pancreas is producing , thereby requiring more insulin to achieve the same blood glucose - lowering effect , and forcing the pancreas to produce even more insulin to compete with the resistance . This negative spiral contributes to pancreatic burnout , and the disease progression of diabetes .
