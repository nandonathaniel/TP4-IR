The Conservative Party of Norway ( Norwegian : Høyre , literally `` right '' ) was formed by the old upper class of state officials and wealthy merchants to fight the populist democracy of the Liberal Party , but lost power in 1884 when parliamentarian government was first practised . It formed its first government under parliamentarism in 1889 , and continued to alternate in power with the Liberals until the 1930s , when Labour became the dominant political party . It has elements both of paternalism , stressing the responsibilities of the state , and of economic liberalism . It first returned to power in the 1960s . During Kåre Willoch 's premiership in the 1980s , much emphasis was laid on liberalizing the credit - and housing market and abolishing the NRK TV and radio monopoly , while supporting law and order in criminal justice and traditional norms in education
