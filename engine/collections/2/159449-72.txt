The citric acid cycle is regulated mainly by the availability of key substrates , particularly the ratio of NAD to NADH and the concentrations of calcium , inorganic phosphate , ATP , ADP , and AMP . Citrate -- the ion that gives its name to the cycle -- is a feedback inhibitor of citrate synthase and also inhibits PFK , providing a direct link between the regulation of the citric acid cycle and glycolysis .
