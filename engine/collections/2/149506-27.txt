Although there is no formal nomination process , recommendations for the award can only be made by the Prime Minister to the President with a maximum number of three nominees being awarded per year . However , in 1999 , four individuals were awarded the honour . The recipient receives a Sanad ( certificate ) signed by the President and a medallion without any monetary grant . Under the terms of Article 18 ( 1 ) of the Constitution , the recipients can not use the award as a prefix or suffix to their name , although recipients may use either the expressions `` Awarded Bharat Ratna by the President '' or `` Recipient of Bharat Ratna Award '' to indicate that they have been honoured with the award . The holders of the Bharat Ratna rank seventh in the Indian order of precedence .
