On 8 July , Tisza informed another meeting of the Crown Council that any attack on Serbia was bound to lead to `` intervention by Russia and consequently world war '' . On the same day , Kurt Riezler 's diary has his friend Bethmann Hollweg saying : `` If the war comes from the East , so that we are marching to Austria - Hungary 's aid instead of Austria - Hungary to ours , then we have a chance of winning it . If war does not come , if the Czar does not want it or France dismayed , counsels peace , then we still have a chance of maneuvering the Entente apart over this action . ''
