In 1996 's Shaw v. Hunt and Shaw v. Reno , O'Connor joined a Rehnquist opinion , following an earlier precedent from an opinion she authored in 1993 , in which the Court struck down an electoral districting plan designed to facilitate the election of two black representatives out of twelve from North Carolina , a state that had not had any black representative since Reconstruction , despite being approximately 20 % black -- the Court held that the districts were unacceptably gerrymandered and O'Connor called the odd shape of the district in question , North Carolina 's 12th , `` bizarre '' .
