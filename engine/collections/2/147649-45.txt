The 13th hole is a tough driving hole , with the barranca on the left side and eucalyptus along the right . The 14th is an easy Par - 3 with the largest green on the golf course but the green is multi-tiered , which makes putting difficult . The 15th hole is a dogleg Par - 4 to the right that features another large green but it 's two - tiered so golfers must make sure their ball is on the proper tier . This hole plays into the breeze of the Pacific Ocean so it 's a pivotal hole in the tournament .
