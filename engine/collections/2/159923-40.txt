During his lifetime several likenesses were made of the poet . The earliest was the anonymous portrait of 1594 now in the National Portrait Gallery , London which has been recently restored . One of the earliest Elizabethan portraits of an author , the fashionably dressed poet is shown darkly brooding on his love . The portrait was described in Donne 's will as `` that picture of myne wych is taken in the shaddowes '' , and bequeathed by him to Robert Kerr , 1st Earl of Ancram . Other paintings include a 1616 head and shoulders after Isaac Oliver , also in the National Portrait Gallery , and a 1622 head and shoulders in the Victoria and Albert Museum . In 1911 the young Stanley Spencer devoted a visionary painting to John Donne arriving in heaven ( 1911 ) which is now in the Fitzwilliam Museum .
