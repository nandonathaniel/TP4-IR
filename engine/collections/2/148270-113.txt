For state legislatures in the United States , Mason 's Manual says , `` A deliberative body can not by its own act or rule require a two - thirds vote to take any action where the constitution or controlling authority requires only a majority vote . To require a two - thirds vote , for example , to take any action would be to give to any number more than one - third of the members the power to defeat the action and amount to a delegation of the powers of the body to a minority . '' Some states require a supermajority for passage of a constitutional amendment or statutory initiative .
