Nao is a teenage girl who tends to be a little air - headed and easygoing . With a semester of junior high school to finish , she convinces her parents to let her stay in the city on the condition that she keep up her grades . Because of a scam in her rental agreement , she and Hisashi Uehara end up sharing an apartment until other options open up . Nao is more often annoyed by Hisashi than attracted by his looks like her classmates . However , she begins to care about getting along with him and grows to like him more than just as a roommate . She starts to date Hisashi later in the story . In the end of the manga , she and Uehara move into different apartments because the landlady of their previous apartment had a son who came back from America and had wanted to rent out a room for him and his girlfriend . When Nao agrees , she looks for other apartments for two and learns that Uehara wishes to live alone to become independent . Although at first shocked and upset , she respects his decision only to find out that the two now live next door to each other because of the help of the landlady of their previous apartment and Nakatsugawa . In the live - action series , she and her friends start as second years in high school .
