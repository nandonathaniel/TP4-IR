If cash flow can decrease drastically , the business will find it needs large amounts of cash from either existing cash balances or from a factor to cover its obligations during this period of time . Likewise , the longer a relatively low cash flow can last , the more cash is needed from another source ( cash balances or a factor ) to cover its obligations during this time . As indicated , the business must balance the opportunity cost of losing a return on the cash that it could otherwise invest , against the costs associated with the use of factoring .
