Ted Sider and others have proposed that considering objects to extend across time as four - dimensional causal series of three - dimensional `` time - slices '' could solve the ship of Theseus problem because , in taking such an approach , all four - dimensional objects remain numerically identical to themselves while allowing individual time - slices to differ from each other . The aforementioned river , therefore , comprises different three - dimensional time - slices of itself while remaining numerically identical to itself across time ; one can never step into the same river - time - slice twice , but one can step into the same ( four - dimensional ) river twice .
