Donna Cabonna is a world - renowned fashion designer , and Raven 's arrogant , snooty , trashy boss . Her name is a parody of real - life designers Donna Karan and Dolce & Gabbana . Donna has started Raven as an intern , in which she is often stuck with many tedious jobs such as getting Donna her coffee and picking after her dog Coco . In one episode in Season 4 , she makes Raven her `` temporary assistant '' when Tiffany goes on a business trip . Raven 's full devotion to her boss causes Devon to break up with her , but they quickly re-unite after a brief talk . Donna has a boyfriend named Teddy ( Richard Steven Horvitz ) , who is much shorter than her , with whom she plays `` break - up and make - up '' every weekend . Despite the many conflicts between Raven and her boss , Donna is very supportive of Raven and believes that she could go far in the fashion industry with her talents .
