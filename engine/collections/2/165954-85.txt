She has a long - running hate and inferiority complex for ex-schoolmate and candy - bar heiress Sue Ellen Mischke . Elaine 's nickname for Sue Ellen was `` The Braless Wonder '' because she never wore a bra in high school , which enticed Elaine 's boyfriend to dump her for Sue Ellen , who appears in 4 episodes : in `` The Caddy '' , she struts down the street wearing a bra as a top , causing Kramer to crash George 's car ; in `` The Bottle Deposit '' , Elaine spends $20,000 on a set of golf clubs ( owned by Pres . Kennedy ) for Mr. Peterman when she 's caught in a vicious bidding war with Sue Ellen at an auction ; in `` The Abstinence '' , Elaine boasts to Sue Ellen about dating a doctor but then is made to look foolish when her boyfriend is completely useless during an emergency at the coffee shop ; finally , in `` The Betrayal '' , Elaine is so unhappy at receiving an `` Unvitation '' ( a super-last - minute invitation ) to Sue Ellen 's wedding , that she travels all the way to India just to show up . It finally ended when George blurted out that Elaine `` slept with the groom '' . Her comeuppance is Sue Ellen hurting her nose by ripping out her nose - pierced stud .
