To promote letter writing , Dodgson invented `` The Wonderland Postage - Stamp Case '' in 1889 . This was a cloth - backed folder with twelve slots , two marked for inserting the most commonly used penny stamp , and one each for the other current denominations up to one shilling . The folder was then put into a slipcase decorated with a picture of Alice on the front and the Cheshire Cat on the back . It intended to organize stamps wherever one stored their writing utensils ; Carroll expressly notes in Eight or Nine Wise Words About Letter - Writing it is not intended to be carried in a pocket or purse , as the most common individual stamps could easily be carried on their own . The pack included a copy of a pamphletted version of this lecture .
