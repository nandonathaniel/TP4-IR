The rules of the IIHF , NHL and Hockey Canada do not permit goaltenders to be designated as on - ice captains , due to the logistical challenge of having the goaltender relay rules discussions between referees and coaches and then return to the crease . The NHL introduced a rule prohibiting the goaltender from being a captain following the 1947 -- 48 season ( see ยง Goaltender captains below ) . In the NCAA , there is no position - based restriction on the team captain .
