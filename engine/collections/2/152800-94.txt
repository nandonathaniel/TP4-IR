While Williams was under contract through 2011 -- 12 with a player option worth $17.7 million for 2012 -- 13 , Jazz chief executive officer Greg Miller did not believe they would be able to re-sign him . `` And while I never saw any indication that he would n't re-sign with us , I never saw any indication he would '' , said Miller . The remainder of the season saw the Jazz continue to struggle , finishing with a 39 -- 43 record , 11th in the Western Conference , therefore missing the playoffs for the first time since 2006 .
