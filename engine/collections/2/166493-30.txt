By the 5th century , the Romans had withdrawn from Britain , and the Angles and the Saxons settled . A heptarchy of new kingdoms began to emerge . One of the methods used by regional kings to solidify their authority over their territories was the use of ceremony and insignia . The tomb of an unknown king -- evidence suggests it may be Rædwald of East Anglia -- at Sutton Hoo provides insight into the regalia of a pre-Christian Anglo - Saxon king . Inside the early 7th - century tomb discovered in 1939 was found the ornate Sutton Hoo helmet , comprising an iron cap , a neck guard , and a face mask , decorated with images of animals and warriors in copper - alloy and set with garnets . He was also buried with a heavy whetstone sceptre , on top of which is an iron ring surmounted by the figure of a stag ; a decorated sword ; and a ceremonial shield .
