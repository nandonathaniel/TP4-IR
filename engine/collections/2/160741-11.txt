The traditional view recognizes that Luke was not an eyewitness of the events in the Gospel , nor of the events prior to Paul 's arrival in Troas in Acts 16 : 8 , and the first `` we '' passage is Acts 16 : 10 . In the preface to Luke , the author refers to having eyewitness testimony of events in the Gospel `` handed down to us '' and to having undertaken a `` careful investigation '' , but the author does not mention his own name or explicitly claim to be an eyewitness to any of the events , except for the we passages .
