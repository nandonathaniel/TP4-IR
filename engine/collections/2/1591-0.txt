The Las Vegas metropolitan area is home to many sports , most of which take place in the unincorporated communities around Las Vegas rather than in the city itself . The Las Vegas Valley has two major league professional teams : the Vegas Golden Knights of the National Hockey League ( NHL ) who began play in 2017 as the region 's first major pro team and the Las Vegas Aces of the WNBA . The Oakland Raiders of the National Football League ( NFL ) will begin play in Las Vegas as the Las Vegas Raiders by 2020 and become the region 's third major professional team . Las Vegas is also home to two minor league sports teams : the Las Vegas 51s of the Triple - A Pacific Coast League ( Minor League Baseball ) and the Las Vegas Lights FC of the United Soccer League , one of two leagues that collectively make up the second level of the U.S. men 's soccer league system . Both teams are currently the only teams to actually play in the city of Las Vegas , playing at the city owned Cashman Field .
