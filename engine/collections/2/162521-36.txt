By late 19th century , hundreds of Lives of Jesus were written . Some of these were purely sensational : They were not produced because any new data had appeared , but because some people read and interpreted the gospels in new ways . These stories of the Lives of Jesus were often romanticized , highly psychological or included new elements which did not appear in any of the gospels or other historical documents . For example , Ernest Renan used the incident where Jesus rides a donkey during his Triumphal entry into Jerusalem to build a story in which Jesus the carpenter was a gentle prophet who had a donkey in Galilee and rode it while traveling between its different towns .
