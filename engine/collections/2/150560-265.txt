However , according to a 2004 survey , a majority of the 1001 parent groups polled wants complete sex education in the schools . The American people are heavily divided over the issue . Over 80 % of polled parents agreed with the statement `` Sex education in school makes it easier for me to talk to my child about sexual issues , '' while under 17 % agreed with the statement that their children were being exposed to `` subjects I do n't think my child should be discussing . '' 10 percent believed that their children 's sexual education class forced them to discuss sexual issues `` too early . '' On the other hand , 49 percent of the respondents ( the largest group ) were `` somewhat confident '' that the values taught in their children 's sex ed classes were similar to those taught at home , and 23 percent were less confident still . ( The margin of error was plus or minus 4.7 percent . )
