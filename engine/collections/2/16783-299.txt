The Popemobile is only seen at the Italian World Grand Prix Race -- he is seen inside a bulletproof `` popemobile '' for his personal protection . He is among the many fans in the stands . The Popemobile is referred to earlier in the film when Mater asks , `` Is the Popemobile Catholic ? '' He has no lines in the film . Black - hatted priests can be seen next to the Popemobile while he sits in the stands at Porta Corsa for the second race in the World Grand Prix . Small Isetta forklifts , similar to the Guido character , are seen in white cassocks and red hats waving incense into the air .
