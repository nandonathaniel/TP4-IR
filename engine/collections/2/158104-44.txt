Vernon Dalhart was the first country singer to have a nationwide hit in May 1924 with `` Wreck of the Old 97 '' . The flip side of the record was `` Lonesome Road Blues '' , which also became very popular . In April 1924 , `` Aunt '' Samantha Bumgarner and Eva Davis became the first female musicians to record and release country songs . Many `` hillbilly '' musicians , such as Cliff Carlisle , recorded blues songs throughout the decade and into the 1930s . Other important early recording artists were Riley Puckett , Don Richardson , Fiddlin ' John Carson , Uncle Dave Macon , Al Hopkins , Ernest V. Stoneman , Blind Alfred Reed , Charlie Poole and the North Carolina Ramblers and The Skillet Lickers . The steel guitar entered country music as early as 1922 , when Jimmie Tarlton met famed Hawaiian guitarist Frank Ferera on the West Coast .
