The history of present day gallantry awards traces back to the rule of East India Company in India . The first formal award was instituted by Lord William Bentinck in 1834 , as the Order of Merit , which was later renamed as Indian Order of Merit in 1902 . During the First World War , the awards were classified based on the English traditions for senior officers , junior officers , and enlisted men . Post-independence , the British honours and awards informally came to an end . However , attempts to institute new awards for India to honour the war heroes of 1947 -- 1948 Indo - Pakistani War failed , as India was still a dominion . Eventually , the award was established on 26 January 1950 , with retroactive effect from 15 August 1947 .
