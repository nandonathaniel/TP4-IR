In Mississippi , evacuation of mobile homes and vulnerable areas took place in Hancock , Jackson , and Harrison counties . In Alabama , evacuation in the areas of Mobile and Baldwin counties south of Interstate 10 was ordered , including a third of the incorporated territory of the City of Mobile , as well as several of its suburbs . In Florida , a full evacuation of the Florida Keys began at 7 : 00 am EDT September 10 but was lifted at 5 : 00 am EDT September 13 as Ivan tracked further west than originally predicted . Voluntary evacuations were declared in ten counties along the Florida Panhandle , with strong emphasis in the immediate western counties of Escambia , Santa Rosa , and Okaloosa . Ivan prompted the evacuation of 270 animals at `` The Little Zoo That Could '' in Alabama . The evacuation had to be completed within a couple of hours , with only 28 volunteers available to move the animals .
