Though various aspects of Super Mario RPG have received mixed reviews , the game garnered praise for the quality of the graphics and for the humor in particular . Nintendo Power 's review commented that the `` excellent '' 3D graphics helped the game appeal to a much wider audience than most traditional RPGs . In March 1997 , Nintendo Power nominated the game for several awards , including `` Best Graphics '' , in a player 's choice contest , though Super Mario 64 won `` Best Graphics '' . Electronic Gaming Monthly praised the graphics , stating that they are `` the best seen on the Super NES '' . Scary Larry of GamePro gave the game a perfect 5 / 5 in all four categories ( graphics , sound , control , and FunFactor ) , and highly praised the rendered enemies , cinematics , and spell animations . 1UP.com stated that the graphic element is `` strong enough to resemble a Mario title but still retains the role - playing theme at the same time '' , and Electronic Gaming Monthly commented that the graphics are `` typical of Nintendo , using clean and colorful graphics along with nice animation '' . RPGamer editor Derek Cavin called the backgrounds `` beautiful '' and stated that they `` perfectly bring the Mushroom Kingdom and surrounding areas into 3D '' . Skyler Miller from Allgame stated that the graphics are `` absolutely outstanding , with colorful , 3D rendered visuals that once seemed impossible on the Super NES . This is definitely the high watermark for 3D graphics on any 16 - bit system '' . The editor also called the music `` quite extraordinary '' and that the songs `` match the mood of the surrounding environment '' . In the Virtual Console re-release , IGN 's Lucas Thomas 's review of Super Mario RPG stated that the game 's experience `` completes itself with a compelling story , a humorous attitude and a variety of interspersed mini-games that break up the adventuring action '' . The publication also stated that the soundtrack is `` spectacular and a joy to listen to '' and the graphics `` took full advantage of the system 's 16 - bit technology and looks great '' .
