In August 2013 , Fry published an `` Open Letter to David Cameron and the IOC '' calling for a boycott of the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi , due to concerns over the state - sanctioned persecution of LGBT persons in Russia . Cameron however stated on Twitter he believed `` we can better challenge prejudice as we attend , rather than boycotting the Winter Olympics '' . Adrian Hilton , writing in the Daily Mail , criticised Fry for not calling for a boycott of all Russian performing arts . Fry responded by accusing the Daily Mail of being `` against progress , the liberalising of attitudes , modern art and strangers ( whether by race , gender or sexuality ) '' . Fry said in 2015 that the Daily Mail editor Paul Dacre `` has done more to damage the Britain I love than any single person '' .
