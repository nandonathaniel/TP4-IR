During the Napoleonic Peninsular War in Europe between France and Spain , assemblies called juntas were established to rule in the name of Ferdinand VII of Spain . The Libertadores ( Spanish and Portuguese for `` Liberators '' ) were the principal leaders of the Spanish American wars of independence . They were predominantly criollos ( Americas - born people of European ancestry , mostly Spanish or Portuguese ) , bourgeois and influenced by liberalism and in some cases with military training in the mother country .
