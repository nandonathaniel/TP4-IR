For reasons of security , the grounds and buildings of Hogwarts are protected by ancient Anti-Apparition and Anti-Disapparition spells , which prevent humans from Apparating on the school grounds . There is also a spell that prevents individuals from Disapparating , which Dumbledore places on the Death Eaters captured at the Ministry in Order of the Phoenix ; a sister spell , which allows one to Apparate into a location but prevents them from Disapparating out of it , is cast by the Death Eaters in Hogsmeade in concordance with the Caterwauling Charm . Dumbledore is the only person who can both Apparate and Disapparate from the school grounds , since he is the headmaster .
