The 1824 election turned into a four - way contest between Jackson , John Quincy Adams , William H. Crawford , and Clay . Jackson won a plurality of the electoral vote and a strong plurality of the popular vote . However , he did not win an electoral majority , which meant that the election was thrown to the House of Representatives , which would decide amongst the top three vote getters . Clay finished fourth . However , he was also Speaker of the House , and maneuvered the election in favor of Adams , who in turn made Clay Secretary of State , an office that in the past had served as a stepping stone to the presidency . Jackson was enraged by this so - called `` corrupt bargain '' to subvert the will of the people . In 1828 , Jackson ran again . His forces were immensely strengthened by the revival of the Old Republican North - South agrarian alliance and its state sovereignty precepts . Most Old Republicans had supported Crawford in 1824 . Alarmed by the centralization in the Adams administration , most of them flocked to Jackson . The transition was made relatively easy by the fact that Jackson 's own principles of government - including commitment to reducing the debt and returning power to the states - were largely in line with their own .
