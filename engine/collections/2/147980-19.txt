Detective Robert Goren ( Vincent D'Onofrio ) is alone in a bar . He is flashing back to his unauthorized undercover operation ( which was covered in the previous episode , `` Untethered '' ) . He is approached by former Detective Patrick Copa ( Holt McCallany ) , who clearly is angered with Goren 's presence at a `` 10 - 13 '' party being held at the bar for Copa 's benefit . Goren caused this detective to lose his job and retirement ( covered in a previous episode . `` Amends '' ) where Goren uncovered the detective 's vision problems and caused the detective 's work to be questioned . A scuffle ensues , and another man , suspended cop Mike Stoat ( Dean Winters ) steps in to help break it up . Stoat tells Goren he knows who he is , and that he 's respected Goren for a long time . He wants to help Goren in his time of need . Since Goren has been suspended from his job for 6 months for the unauthorized undercover operation , Stoat offers Goren a job , and when Stoat leaves , Goren sees he left a gun on the bar counter , wrapped in a newspaper . Goren takes the gun .
