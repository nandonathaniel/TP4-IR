Ford chose his friend , Hollywood composer Victor Young , to compose the score for the film . Young sprinkled the soundtrack with many Irish airs such as the `` Rakes of Mallow '' and `` The Wild Colonial Boy '' . One piece of music , chosen by Ford himself , is most prominent : the melody the `` Isle of Innisfree '' , written not by Young , but by the Irish policeman / songwriter Richard Farrelly . The melody of the `` Isle of Innisfree '' , which is first heard over the opening credit sequence with Ashford Castle in the background , becomes the principal musical theme of The Quiet Man . The melody is reprised at least eleven times throughout the film .
