The ILC 's first special rapporteur on state responsibility , F.V. García Amador of Cuba , appointed in 1955 noted , `` It would be difficult to find a topic beset with greater confusion and uncertainty . '' García Amador attempted to return to the traditional focus on responsibility for injury to aliens but his work was essentially abandoned by the ILC when his membership ended in 1961 . His successor , Roberto Ago of Italy , reconceptualised the ILC 's work in terms of the distinction between primary and secondary rules , and also established the basic organisational structure of what would become the Draft Articles . By focusing on general rules , stated at a high level of abstraction , Ago created a politically safe space within which the ILC could work and largely avoid the contentious debates of the day . From 1969 until his election to the ICJ in 1980 , Ago completed work on part 1 of the draft articles , addressing the origin of state responsibility . Most of the thirty - five articles adopted during his tenure are reflected in the final draft .
