Two soundtrack albums were released . The first , Woodstock : Music from the Original Soundtrack and More , was a 3 - LP ( later 2 - CD ) album containing a sampling of one or two songs by most of the acts who performed . A year later , Woodstock 2 was released as a 2 - LP album . Both albums included recordings of stage announcements ( many by Production Coordinator John Morris , e.g. , `` ( We 're told ) that the brown acid is not specifically too good '' , `` Hey , if you think really hard , maybe we can stop this rain '' ) and crowd noises ( i.e. , the rain chant ) between songs . In 1994 , a third album , Woodstock Diary was released . Tracks from all three albums , as well as numerous additional , previously unreleased performances from the festival but not the stage announcements and crowd noises , were reissued by Atlantic as a 4 - CD box set titled Woodstock : Three Days of Peace and Music .
