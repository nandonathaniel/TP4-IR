During the American Revolutionary War , the river and bay were the site of the disastrous 1779 Penobscot Expedition , where an entire American fleet was destroyed in a botched attempt to retake Maine from the British . During the War of 1812 , the British again invaded Maine and defeated an American force at the Battle of Hampden , sacking the town of Bangor in the process . To prevent this from happening a third time , and because the nearby boundary between the United States and British Canada was still contested into the 1840s , the Federal government in 1844 began constructing a huge granite fort , Fort Knox , opposite the town of Bucksport , near the mouth of the river . The fort never fired a shot in anger , but remains one of the Penobscot 's major man - made landmarks .
