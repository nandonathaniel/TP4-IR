The . 410 bore ( 10.4 mm ) is unusual , being measured in inches , and would be approximately 67 `` real '' gauge , though its short hull versions are nominally called 36 gauge in Europe . It uses a relatively small charge of shot . It is used for hunting and for skeet . Because of its very light recoil ( approx 10 N ) , it is often used as a beginner 's gun . However , the small charge and typically tight choke make it more difficult to hit targets . It is also frequently used by expert shooters because of the difficulty , especially in expensive side by side and over / under models for hunting small bird game such as quail and doves . Inexpensive bolt - action . 410 shotguns are a very common first hunting shotgun among young pre-teen hunters , as they are used mostly for hunting squirrels , while additionally teaching bolt - action manipulation skills that will transfer easily later to adult - sized hunting rifles . Most of these young hunters move up to a 20 - gauge within a few years , and to 12 gauge shotguns and full - size hunting rifles by their late teens . Still , many who are particularly recoil - averse choose to stay with 20 - gauge shotguns all their adult life , as it is a suitable gauge for many popular hunting uses .
