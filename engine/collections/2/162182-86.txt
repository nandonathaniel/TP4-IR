More than 80,000 Mississippians fought in the American Civil War , and casualties were extremely heavy . Fear that white supremacy might be lost was among the reasons that men joined the Confederate Army . Men who owned more property , including slaves , were more likely to volunteer . But men in Mississippi 's river counties , regardless of their wealth or other characteristics , joined at lower rates than those living in the state 's interior . River - county residents were especially vulnerable and apparently left their communities for safer areas ( and sometimes moved out of the Confederacy ) rather than face invasion .
