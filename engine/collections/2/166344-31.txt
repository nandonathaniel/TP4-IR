Malak shows them a secret route to the throne room . Conan confronts Bombaata and kills him in combat . Zula impales the Grand Vizier ( Jeff Corey ) before he can sacrifice Jehnna . Because Bombaata and the Vizier were `` impure sacrifices '' , the rising Dagoth ( Andr√© the Giant ) becomes distorted from a beautiful human form into a monstrous entity . Dagoth kills Taramis , then attacks Conan . Zula and Malak join the fight , but are effortlessly swept aside by the entity . Akiro tells Conan that the horn is the monster 's power source , Conan leaps onto the demon 's back and tears out Dagoth 's horn , weakening the creature enough to kill him .
