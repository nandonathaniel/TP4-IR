There are four posterior thigh muscles . The biceps femoris has two heads : The long head has its origin on the ischial tuberosity together with the semitendinosus and acts on two joints . The short head originates from the middle third of the linea aspera on the shaft of the femur and the lateral intermuscular septum of thigh , and acts on only one joint . These two heads unite to form the biceps which inserts on the head of the fibula . The biceps flexes the knee joint and rotates the flexed leg laterally -- it is the only lateral rotator of the knee and thus has to oppose all medial rotator . Additionally , the long head extends the hip joint . The semitendinosus and the semimembranosus share their origin with the long head of the biceps , and both attaches on the medial side of the proximal head of the tibia together with the gracilis and sartorius to form the pes anserinus . The semitendinosus acts on two joints ; extension of the hip , flexion of the knee , and medial rotation of the leg . Distally , the semimembranosus ' tendon is divided into three parts referred to as the pes anserinus profondus . Functionally , the semimembranosus is similar to the semitendinosus , and thus produces extension at the hip joint and flexion and medial rotation at the knee . Posteriorly below the knee joint , the popliteus stretches obliquely from the lateral femoral epicondyle down to the posterior surface of the tibia . The subpopliteal bursa is located deep to the muscle . Popliteus flexes the knee joint and medially rotates the leg .
