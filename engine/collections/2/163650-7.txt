Hypocapnia also results in bronchoconstriction in order to decrease ventilation . This mechanism is meant to counteract hyperventilation , and decrease the amount of oxygen coming into the lungs . The body 's `` goal '' is to have a relatively even ratio of the partial pressure of oxygen to the partial pressure of carbon dioxide . Chemoreceptors in the body sense a change in partial pressures and pH ( hydrogen ion concentration ) in the blood . Chemoreceptors are responsible for signaling vasoconstriction , vasodilation , bronchoconstriction , and bronchodilation .
