Don Drysdale became the play - by - play announcer in 1982 , as the White Sox began splitting their broadcasts between WFLD and the new regional cable television network , Sportsvision . Ahead of its time , Sportsvision had a chance to gain huge profits for the Sox . However , few people would subscribe to the channel after being used to free - to - air broadcasts for many years , along with Sportsvision being stunted by the city of Chicago 's wiring for cable television taking much longer than many markets because of it being an area where over-the - air subscription services were still more popular , resulting in the franchise losing around $300,000 a month . While this was going on , every Cubs game was on WGN , with Harry Caray becoming the national icon he never was with the White Sox . The relatively easy near - national access to Cubs games versus Sox games in this era , combined with the popularity of Caray and the Cubs being owned by the Tribune Company , is said by some to be the main cause of the Cubs ' advantage in popularity over the Sox .
