Millennium is approached by Dag Svensson , a young journalist , and his girlfriend , Mia Johansson . They have put together a meticulously - researched report , ironically titled `` From Russia with Love '' , about sex trafficking in Sweden and the abuse of underage girls by high - ranking figures ; this is the subject of Johansson 's doctoral thesis and Svensson wants Millennium to publish his expos√© in book form . Whilst the research is mostly complete , Svensson , Johansson , and the Millennium staff are intrigued by recurring mentions of `` Zala '' , a shadowy figure heavily involved in Sweden 's sex - trafficking industry . Salander , hacking Mikael Blomkvist 's computer , is taken aback by the mention of Zala , and visits Svensson and Johansson to ask questions .
