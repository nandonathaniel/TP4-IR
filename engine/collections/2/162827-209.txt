Jump up ^ Prior to the introduction of Division II men 's soccer in 1972 , all schools competed in one division . All Division II and III schools moved into Division II in 1972 , but a number of schools that desired to compete at a higher level returned to Division I in 1973 and were allowed to grant the same number of scholarships as full Division I schools ( 15 at that time versus 9.9 today ) . Hartwick College , a Division III school , was one of those schools that returned to Division I in 1973 , and the school won the 1977 NCAA Division I Men 's Soccer Championship . In 2004 , Hartwick was one of eight Division III schools allowed under the NCAA 's Proposal 65 - 1 to maintain their one traditional Division I sport ( along with one women 's sport ) . ( Two of the eight have since moved those sports to Division III . ) Although one men 's soccer school is scheduled to start a transition from Division II to Division I in 2018 , with another set to do the same in 2020 , Hartwick is now the only true non-Division I school playing Division I men 's soccer .
