Roberto , staking out Salander 's former apartment in the hopes of catching Wu , witnesses her being kidnapped into a van by a paunchy man with a ponytail ( Salander 's earlier attacker ) and a `` blond giant '' . He follows the van to a warehouse south of Nykvarn , where he attempts to rescue Wu by boxing with the giant . He finds his opponent unusually muscular and totally insensitive to pain , and only through applications of massive blunt trauma can he and Wu stun the giant enough to escape . The giant recovers and sets the warehouse on fire to destroy the evidence . However , Roberto is able to direct the police to the site , where they find three buried and dismembered bodies .
