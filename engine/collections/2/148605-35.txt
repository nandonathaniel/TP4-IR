Some landholders avoided such restrictions and entanglements by buying water access rights to distant springs , not necessarily on their own land . A few , of high wealth and status , built their own aqueducts to transport such water from source to field or villa ; Mumius Niger Valerius Vegetus bought the rights to a spring and its water from his neighbour , and access rights to a corridor of intervening land , then built an aqueduct of just under 10 kilometres , connecting the springhead to his own villa . The senatorial permission for this `` Aqua Vegetiana '' was given only when the project seemed not to impinge on the water rights of other citizens .
