While Hellmann 's Mayonnaise thrived on the U.S. East Coast , selling $15 million a year by 1927 with $1 million in profits , the California company Postum Foods ( later Best Foods ) introduced their own mayonnaise , Best Foods Mayonnaise , which became popular on the West Coast , and was operating a major plant in San Francisco . In August 1927 Postum Foods bought the Hellmann 's brand , allowing Hellmann to retire . By then both brands of mayonnaise had such commanding market shares in their respective halves of the country that the company decided that both brands and recipes be preserved along with territories .
