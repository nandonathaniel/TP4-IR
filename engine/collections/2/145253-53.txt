The House of Lords developed from the `` Great Council '' ( Magnum Concilium ) that advised the King during medieval times . This royal council came to be composed of ecclesiastics , noblemen , and representatives of the counties of England and Wales ( afterwards , representatives of the boroughs as well ) . The first English Parliament is often considered to be the `` Model Parliament '' ( held in 1295 ) , which included archbishops , bishops , abbots , earls , barons , and representatives of the shires and boroughs of it .
