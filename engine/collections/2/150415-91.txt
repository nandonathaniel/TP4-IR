One crucial change was the shift towards harmonies centering on `` flatward '' keys : shifts in the subdominant direction . In the Classical style , major key was far more common than minor , chromaticism being moderated through the use of `` sharpward '' modulation ( e.g. , a piece in C major modulating to G major , D major , or A major , all of which are keys with more sharps ) . As well , sections in the minor mode were often used for contrast . Beginning with Mozart and Clementi , there began a creeping colonization of the subdominant region ( the ii or IV chord , which in the key of C major would be the keys of d minor or F major ) . With Schubert , subdominant modulations flourished after being introduced in contexts in which earlier composers would have confined themselves to dominant shifts ( modulations to the dominant chord , e.g. , in the key of C major , modulating to G major ) . This introduced darker colors to music , strengthened the minor mode , and made structure harder to maintain . Beethoven contributed to this by his increasing use of the fourth as a consonance , and modal ambiguity -- for example , the opening of the Symphony No. 9 in D minor .
