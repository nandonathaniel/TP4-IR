The structure of the poem is also meant to loosely follow the vegetation myth and Holy Grail folklore surrounding the Fisher King story as outlined by Jessie Weston in her book From Ritual to Romance ( 1920 ) . Weston 's book was so central to the structure of the poem that it was the first text that Eliot cited in his `` Notes on the Waste Land '' .
