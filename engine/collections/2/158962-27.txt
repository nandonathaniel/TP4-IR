London dispersion forces , named after the German - American physicist Fritz London , are weak intermolecular forces that arise from the interactive forces between instantaneous multipoles in molecules without permanent multipole moments . These forces dominate the interaction of non-polar molecules , and are often more significant than Keesom and Debye forces in polar molecules . London dispersion forces are also known as ' dispersion forces ' , ' London forces ' , or ' instantaneous dipole -- induced dipole forces ' . The strength of London dispersion forces is proportional to the polarizability of the molecule , which in turn depends on the total number of electrons and the area over which they are spread . Any connection between the strength of London dispersion forces and mass is coincidental .
