In January 1963 , Lehman invited one of his favorite directors , William Wyler , to travel to New York City with him to see the Broadway musical . After seeing the show , Wyler said he hated it , but after two weeks of Lehman 's persuasion , Wyler reluctantly agreed to direct and produce the film . After hiring musical supervisor Roger Edens , Wyler , Lehman , and Edens traveled to Salzburg to scout filming locations . In two weeks they managed to see approximately seventy - five locations -- an experience that helped Lehman conceptualize several important sequences . During that trip , Lehman began to have reservations about Wyler 's commitment to the project , and communicated this to Zanuck , who instructed the writer to finalize the first draft of the screenplay as quickly as possible . Lehman completed the first draft on September 10 , 1963 and sent it to Wyler , who had no suggestions or changes . At that time , Lehman also secretly gave a copy of the script to the agent of Robert Wise , whom Lehman still wanted as the director . Later that month , Wyler 's agent approached Zanuck asking that production on the film be delayed so Wyler could direct The Collector . Zanuck told him to tell Wyler to make the other film , and that they would move ahead on schedule with another director , ending Wyler 's participation .
