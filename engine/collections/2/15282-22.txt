Floors may be built on beams or joists or use structures like prefabricated hollow core slabs . The subfloor builds on those and attaches by various means particular to the support structure but the support and subfloor together always provides the strength of a floor one can sense underfoot . Nowadays , subfloors are generally made from at least two layers of moisture resistant ( ' AC ' grade , one side finished and sanded flat ) plywood or composite sheeting , jointly also termed Underlayments on floor joists of 2x8 , 2x10 , or 2x12 's ( dimensional lumber ) spaced generally on 16 - inch ( 40.6 cm ) centers , in the United States and Canada . Some flooring components used solely on concrete slabs consist of a dimpled rubberized or plastic layer much like bubble wrap that provide little tiny pillars for the one - half - inch ( 12.7 mm ) sheet material above . These are manufactured in 2 ft × 2 ft ( 61 cm × 61 cm ) squares and the edges fit together like a mortise and tenon joint . Like a floor on joists not on concrete , a second sheeting underlayment layer is added with staggered joints to disperse forces that would open a joint under the stress of live loads like a person walking .
