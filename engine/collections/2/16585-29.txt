The updates to the ACU trousers in late 2010 included removal of Velcro fasteners from forward - tilted thigh cargo pocket flaps which were replaced with 3 buttons . This change was introduced gradually from 2009 onward and is now in full effect . Two buttons are standard ( same function as on BDU trouser cargo pockets ) , while the third button located at the very end of the pocket can be used to allow for more load and extra volume in cargo pockets . On the small calf pockets the 3 - piece Velcro ( 2 square hook on pocket and one rectangular loop patch on the flap ) have been replaced with a single button in 2012 . Buttons were re-introduced and replaced Velcro on pockets after numerous complaints from soldiers in the field .
