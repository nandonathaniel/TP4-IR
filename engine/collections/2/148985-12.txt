In 1969 ( fifteen years after the introduction of the breathalyzer into Canada ) , Parliament created an offence of driving while `` over 80 '' ( over 80 milligrams of alcohol per 100 millilitres of blood ) . In 1976 , Parliament made the penalty the same as driving while impaired , created the offence of refusing to provide a breath sample ( with the same penalties ) , and created laws allowing the police to use roadside screening devices . Both offences are now set out in the same section of the Criminal Code , section 253 .
