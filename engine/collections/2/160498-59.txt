The NFL announced on November 8 that the Week 13 rivalry game between the Indianapolis Colts and New England Patriots would be moved to 1 : 00 p.m. Eastern on CBS , while a replacement game would be announced by November 22 . This was due to the Colts struggling without their star quarterback Peyton Manning ( without him , the Colts lost 62 -- 7 to the New Orleans Saints in a Sunday night game on October 23 ) . This also marked the first time the NFL announced that a Sunday night game was being moved to the afternoon without simultaneously announcing a replacement . On November 21 , the matchup between the Detroit Lions and New Orleans Saints was flexed into the Sunday night slot . As compensation to Fox because they only had two other games in the early time slot , the league gave them the Denver Broncos -- Minnesota Vikings game that was originally to air on CBS . This was the first time that the league moved an interconference telecast to the home team 's Sunday afternoon regional broadcaster .
