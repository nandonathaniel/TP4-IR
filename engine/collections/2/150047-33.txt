Reza Shah was deposed in 1941 by an invasion of allied British and Soviet troops who believed him to be sympathetic with the allies ' enemy Nazi Germany . His son , Mohammad Reza Pahlavi was installed by the allies as monarch . Prince Pahlavi ( later crowned shah ) reigned until the 1979 revolution with one brief interruption . In 1953 he fled the country after a power - struggle with his Prime Minister Mohammad Mossadegh . Mossadegh is remembered in Iran for having been voted into power through a democratic election , nationalizing Iran 's British - owned oil fields , and being deposed in a military coup d'Ã©tat organized by an American CIA operative and aided by the British MI6 . Thus foreign powers were involved in both the installation and restoration of Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi .
