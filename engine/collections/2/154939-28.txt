In April 2011 , shortly before the publication of A Dance with Dragons which took him six years to write , Martin hoped that `` the last two books will go a little quicker than this one has '' and estimated that it would take `` three years to finish the next one at a good pace '' . By October 2012 , 400 pages of the sixth novel had been written , although Martin considered only the first 200 as `` really finished '' , the rest still needing revisions . In April 2013 , Martin estimated that he had a quarter of the book . In the past , Martin has angered some of his fan base for repeatedly estimating his publication dates too optimistically ; therefore , he has refrained from making hard estimates for The Winds of Winter 's final release date . Ultimately the book `` will be done when it 's done '' . In 2012 , Martin had acknowledged his concerns about the final novel , A Dream of Spring , not being completed by the time the TV series Game of Thrones catches up in its storyline to the novels .
