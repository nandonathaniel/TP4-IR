Privatization , or the selling of Crown corporations to private interests , has become common throughout Canada over the past 30 years . Petro - Canada , Canadian National Railway , and Air Canada are examples of former federal Crown corporations that have been privatized . Privatized provincial Crown corporations include Alberta Government Telephones ( which merged with privately owned BC Tel to form Telus ) , BCRIC , Manitoba Telecom Services , Saskatchewan Oil & Gas Corporation and Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan .
