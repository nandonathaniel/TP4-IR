The Pakistan 's test series was followed by a six Test series against the touring West Indies at the height of their powers . The First Test was held in Kanpur and India were crushed by an innings . Gavaskar had his bat knocked out of his hand by a hostile delivery from Malcolm Marshall before being dismissed . In the Second Test in Delhi , Gavaskar delivered his riposte to Marshall , hooking him for a consecutive four and six to start his innings . Gavaskar , unwilling to be dictated to by the Caribbean pacemen , hooked the short - pitched barrage relentlessly , reaching his half century in 37 balls . He then went on to score 121 , his 29th Test century in 94 balls in his 95th test match , equalling Don Bradman 's world record . He also passed 8000 Test runs in the innings , and was personally honoured by Indira Gandhi , the Prime Minister of India at the ground . The match was drawn . Gavaskar 's 90 in the Third Test at Ahmedabad saw him pass Geoff Boycott 's Test world record of 8114 career runs , but was insufficient to prevent another defeat . During the Fifth Test in the series , India were defeated by an innings at Calcutta to concede a 3 -- 0 series lead . India had won only one of their 32 most recent Tests and none of their last 28 . The crowd singled out the Gavaskar , who had made a golden duck and 20 . Angry spectators pelted objects onto the playing arena and clashed with police , before stoning the team bus . In the Sixth Test in Madras , he compiled his 30th Test century in his 99th test match , with an unbeaten 236 which was the highest Test score by an Indian . It was his 30th Test century and third double century against the West Indies , propelling him to overtake Donald Bradman 's 29 test centuries record . He had aggregated 505 at 50.50 for the series .
