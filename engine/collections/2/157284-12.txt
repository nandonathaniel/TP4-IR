At least five English translations have been made . Of those , the Ralph Parker 's translation ( New York : Dutton , 1963 ) was the first to be published , followed by Ronald Hingley and Max Hayward 's ( New York : Praeger , 1963 ) , Bela Von Block 's ( New York : Lancer 1963 ) , and Gillon Aitken 's ( New York : Farrar Straus Giroux , 1971 ) . The fifth translation , by H.T. Willetts ( New York : Noonday / Farrar Straus Giroux , 1991 ) , is the only one that is based on the canonical Russian text and the only one authorized by Solzhenitsyn . The English spelling of some character names differs slightly among the translations .
