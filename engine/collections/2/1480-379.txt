With the disfranchisement of African Americans in 1901 , the state became part of the `` Solid South '' , a system in which the Democratic Party operated as effectively the only viable political party in every Southern state . For nearly 100 years , local and state elections in Alabama were decided in the Democratic Party primary , with generally only token Republican challengers running in the General Election . Since the mid to late 20th century , however , there has been a realignment among the two major political parties , and white conservatives started shifting to the Republican Party . In Alabama , majority - white districts are now expected to regularly elect Republican candidates to federal , state and local office .
