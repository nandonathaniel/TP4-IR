Indonesia 's size , tropical climate , and archipelagic geography support a high level of biodiversity . Its flora and fauna is a mixture of Asian and Australasian species . The islands of the Sunda Shelf ( Sumatra , Java , Borneo , and Bali ) were once linked to the Asian mainland , and have a wealth of Asian fauna . Large species such as the Sumatran tiger , rhinoceros , orangutan , Asian elephant , and leopard , were once abundant as far east as Bali , but numbers and distribution have dwindled drastically . In Sumatra and Kalimantan , these are predominantly of Asian species . Forests cover approximately 70 % of the country . However , the forests of the smaller , and more densely populated Java , have largely been removed for human habitation and agriculture . Sulawesi , Nusa Tenggara , and Maluku -- having been long separated from the continental landmasses -- have developed their own unique flora and fauna . Papua was part of the Australian landmass , and is home to a unique fauna and flora closely related to that of Australia , including over 600 bird species .
