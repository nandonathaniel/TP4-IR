The mainstay for medical management of uric acid stones is alkalinization ( increasing the pH ) of the urine . Uric acid stones are among the few types amenable to dissolution therapy , referred to as chemolysis . Chemolysis is usually achieved through the use of oral medications , although in some cases , intravenous agents or even instillation of certain irrigating agents directly onto the stone can be performed , using antegrade nephrostomy or retrograde ureteral catheters . Acetazolamide ( Diamox ) is a medication that alkalinizes the urine . In addition to acetazolamide or as an alternative , certain dietary supplements are available that produce a similar alkalinization of the urine . These include sodium bicarbonate , potassium citrate , magnesium citrate , and Bicitra ( a combination of citric acid monohydrate and sodium citrate dihydrate ) . Aside from alkalinization of the urine , these supplements have the added advantage of increasing the urinary citrate level , which helps to reduce the aggregation of calcium oxalate stones .
