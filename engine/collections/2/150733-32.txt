Despite Hadithic sayings against the wearing of silk , the Byzantine and Sassanian traditions of grand figured silk woven cloth continued under Islam . Some designs are calligraphic , especially when made for palls to cover a tomb , but more are surprisingly conservative versions of the earlier traditions , with many large figures of animals , especially majestic symbols of power like the lion and eagle . These are often enclosed in roundels , as found in the pre-Islamic traditions . The majority of early silks have been recovered from tombs , and in Europe reliquaries , where the relics were often wrapped in silk . European clergy and nobility were keen buyers of Islamic silk from an early date and , for example , the body of an early bishop of Toul in France was wrapped in a silk from the Bukhara area in modern Uzbekistan , probably when the body was reburied in 820 . The Shroud of St Josse is a famous samite cloth from East Persia , which originally had a carpet - like design with two pairs of confronted elephants , surrounded by borders including rows of camels and an inscription in Kufic script , from which the date appears to be before 961 . Other silks were used for clothes , hangings , altarcloths , and church vestments , which have nearly all been lost , except for some vestments .
