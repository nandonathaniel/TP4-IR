In 2001 , Haysbert became best known when he was cast in 24 as U.S. Senator David Palmer , who served as the first black U.S. President ( in the context of the show ) during the second and third seasons . He also returned as a guest star in the last six episodes of season 4 and the first episode of season 5 . He was nominated for a Golden Globe and for a Golden Satellite Award in 2002 for this role . Haysbert stated in an interview for the show that the three men he admires most -- Jimmy Carter , Bill Clinton , and Colin Powell -- collectively embody his idea of what a President should be . Haysbert believes that his playing of David Palmer on 24 helped Barack Obama -- whom Haysbert supported -- to win the 2008 Democratic presidential nomination .
