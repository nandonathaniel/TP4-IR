In his address before the 2004 Democratic National Convention , Barack Obama rejected the division of the United States into red states and blue states , saying : `` The pundits like to slice - and - dice our country into red states and blue states -- red states for Republicans , and blue states for Democrats . But I 've got news for them , too . We worship an awesome God in the blue states , and we do n't like federal agents poking around our libraries in the red states . We coach Little League in the blue states and have gay friends in the red states. ... We are one people , all of us pledging allegiance to the stars and stripes , all of us defending the United States of America . ''
