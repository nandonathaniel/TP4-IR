Emissions from automobile air conditioning are a growing concern because of their impact on climate change . From 2011 on , the European Union will phase out refrigerants with a global warming potential ( GWP ) of more than 150 in automotive air conditioning ( GWP = 100 year warming potential of one kilogram of a gas relative to one kilogram of CO ) . This will ban potent greenhouse gases such as the refrigerant HFC - 134a ( also known as R - 134a in North America ) -- which has a GWP of 1410 -- to promote safe and energy - efficient refrigerants .
