The popularity of The Simpsons has made it a billion - dollar merchandising industry . The title family and supporting characters appear on everything from T - shirts to posters . The Simpsons has been used as a theme for special editions of well - known board games , including Clue , Scrabble , Monopoly , Operation , and The Game of Life , as well as the trivia games What Would Homer Do ? and Simpsons Jeopardy !. Several card games such as trump cards and The Simpsons Trading Card Game have also been released . Many official or unofficial Simpsons books such as episode guides have been published . Many episodes of the show have been released on DVD and VHS over the years . When the first season DVD was released in 2001 , it quickly became the best - selling television DVD in history , although it was later overtaken by the first season of Chappelle 's Show . In particular , seasons one through seventeen have been released on DVD in the U.S. ( Region 1 ) , Europe ( Region 2 ) and Australia / New Zealand / Latin America ( Region 4 ) .
