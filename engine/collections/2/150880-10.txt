Transformation has been studied in medically important Gram - negative bacteria species such as Helicobacter pylori , Legionella pneumophila , Neisseria meningitidis , Neisseria gonorrhoeae , Haemophilus influenzae and Vibrio cholerae . It has also been studied in Gram - negative species found in soil such as Pseudomonas stutzeri , Acinetobacter baylyi , and Gram - negative plant pathogens such as Ralstonia solanacearum and Xylella fastidiosa . Transformation among Gram - positive bacteria has been studied in medically important species such as Streptococcus pneumoniae , Streptococcus mutans , Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus sanguinis and in Gram - positive soil bacterium Bacillus subtilis . It has also been reported in at least 30 species of Proteobacteria distributed in the classes alpha , beta , gamma and epsilon . The best studied Proteobacteria with respect to transformation are the medically important human pathogens Neisseria gonorrhoeae ( class beta ) , Haemophilus influenzae ( class gamma ) and Helicobacter pylori ( class epsilon )
