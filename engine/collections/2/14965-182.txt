Theodoric was tolerant towards the Catholic Church and did not interfere in dogmatic matters . He remained as neutral as possible towards the pope , though he exercised a preponderant influence in the affairs of the papacy . Ostrogothic influence ended with the reconquest of Rome by Justinian , who had had pro-Gothic Pope Silverius ( 536 -- 537 ) deposed and replaced with his own choice , Pope Vigilius ( 537 -- 555 ) .
