Beginning from 21 November 1962 , the Chinese frontier guards will cease fire along the entire Sino - Indian border . Beginning from 1 December 1962 , the Chinese frontier guards will withdraw to positions 20 kilometres behind the line of actual control which existed between China and India on 7 November 1959 . In the eastern sector , although the Chinese frontier guards have so far been fighting on Chinese territory north of the traditional customary line , they are prepared to withdraw from their present positions to the north of the illegal McMahon Line , and to withdraw twenty kilometres back from that line . In the middle and western sectors , the Chinese frontier guards will withdraw twenty kilometres from the line of actual control .
