When the battle was commenced , Arjuna created a Vajra formation and Bhishma went through the Pandava formation wreaking havoc wherever he went , but Abhimanyu , Arjuna 's son , seeing this went straight at Bhishma , defeated his bodyguards and directly attacked the commander of the Kaurava forces . However , the young warrior could n't match the prowess of Bhishma , and was defeated . The Pandavas suffered heavy losses and were defeated at the end of the first day . Virata 's sons , Uttara and Sweta , were slain by Shalya and Bhishma . Krishna consoled the distraught Yudhishthira saying that eventually victory would be his .
