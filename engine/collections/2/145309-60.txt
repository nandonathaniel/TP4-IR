In the fall of 1965 , Simon was in Denmark , performing at small clubs , and picked up a copy of Billboard , as he had routinely done for several years . Upon seeing `` The Sounds of Silence '' in the Billboard Hot 100 , he bought a copy of Cashbox and saw the same thing . Several days later , Garfunkel excitedly called Simon to inform him of the single 's growing success . A copy of the 7 '' single arrived in the mail the next day , and according to friend Al Stewart , `` ( Paul ) was horrified when he first heard it ... ( when the ) rhythm section slowed down at one point so that Paul and Artie 's voices could catch up . '' Garfunkel was far less concerned about the remix , feeling conditioned to the process of trying to create a hit single : `` It 's interesting . I suppose it might do something . It might sell , '' he told Wilson .
