Supply is the relation between the price of a good and the quantity available for sale at that price . It may be represented as a table or graph relating price and quantity supplied . Producers , for example business firms , are hypothesized to be profit - maximizers , meaning that they attempt to produce and supply the amount of goods that will bring them the highest profit . Supply is typically represented as a function relating price and quantity , if other factors are unchanged .
