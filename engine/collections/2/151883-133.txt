Borges lived and studied in Switzerland and Spain as a young student . As Borges matured , he traveled through Argentina as a lecturer and , internationally , as a visiting professor ; he continued to tour the world as he grew older , finally settling in Geneva where he had spent some of his youth . Drawing on the influence of many times and places , Borges 's work belittled nationalism and racism . Portraits of diverse coexisting cultures characteristic of Argentina are especially pronounced in the book Six Problems for don Isidoro Parodi ( co-authored with Bioy Casares ) and Death and the Compass . Borges wrote that he considered Mexican essayist Alfonso Reyes to be `` the best prose - writer in the Spanish language of any time . ''
