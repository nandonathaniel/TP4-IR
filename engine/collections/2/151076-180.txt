Similarly , in 1996 , member countries of the European Union , per Directive 94 / 33 / EC , agreed to a number of exceptions for young people in its child labour laws . Under these rules , children of various ages may work in cultural , artistic , sporting or advertising activities if authorised by the competent authority . Children above the age of 13 may perform light work for a limited number of hours per week in other economic activities as defined at the discretion of each country . Additionally , the European law exception allows children aged 14 years or over to work as part of a work / training scheme . The EU Directive clarified that these exceptions do not allow child labour where the children may experience harmful exposure to dangerous substances . Nonetheless , many children under the age of 13 do work , even in the most developed countries of the EU . For instance , a recent study showed over a third of Dutch twelve - year - old kids had a job , the most common being babysitting .
