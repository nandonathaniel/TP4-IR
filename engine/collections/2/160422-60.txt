The Atlantic hurricane season officially runs from June 1 through November 30 , although hurricanes can develop beyond those dates . The most likely time for Miami to be hit is during the peak of the Cape Verde season which is mid-August through the end of September . Due to its location between two major bodies of water known for tropical activity , Miami is also statistically the most likely major city in the world to be struck by a hurricane , trailed closely by Nassau , Bahamas , and Havana , Cuba . Despite this , the city has been fortunate in not having a direct hit by a hurricane since Hurricane Cleo in 1964 . However , many other hurricanes have affected the city , namely the Great Miami Hurricane in 1926 , Betsy in 1965 , Andrew in 1992 , Irene in 1999 , and Hurricanes Katrina and Wilma in 2005 . At least 35 direct and 26 indirect deaths in Florida were attributed to Wilma .
