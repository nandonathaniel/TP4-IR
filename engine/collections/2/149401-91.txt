Lothlórien : a soft , ethereal chorus accompanied by cellos in the Phrygian mode . It is written in an adapted form the Maqam Hijaz , so as to create a sense of antiquity and provide Lothlórien with a slightly unsettling effect . A more hard - edged , brass - driven version of the theme appears in the second film during the battle of Helm 's Deep .
