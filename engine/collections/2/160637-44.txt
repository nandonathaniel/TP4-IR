In economics , a free market is an idealized system in which the prices for goods and services are determined by the open market and consumers , in which the laws and forces of supply and demand are free from any intervention by a government , price - setting monopoly , or other authority . Proponents of the concept of free market contrast it with a regulated market , in which a government intervenes in supply and demand through various methods such as tariffs used to restrict trade and protect the economy . In an idealized free market economy , prices for goods and services are set freely by the forces of supply and demand and are allowed to reach their point of equilibrium without intervention by government policy .
