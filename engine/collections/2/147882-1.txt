One interpretation of this parable is that it demonstrates the importance of persistence in prayer , never giving up . It is found immediately prior to the parable of the Pharisee and the Publican ( also on prayer ) and is similar to the Parable of the Friend at Night . Other scholars note that the content of the parable makes no reference to prayer and that the introduction of prayer as a theme is generally inspired by the Lucan construction in verses 6 - 8 and by the fact that Luke placed the parable of the Pharisee and Publican influentially after this one . Whatever approach is taken , it is noteworthy that the judge in the parable does not act on the basis of justice .
