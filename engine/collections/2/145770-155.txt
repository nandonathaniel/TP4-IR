The Chinese resistance stiffened after 7 July 1937 , when a clash occurred between Chinese and Japanese troops outside Beijing ( then named Beiping ) near the Marco Polo Bridge . This skirmish led to open , though undeclared , warfare between China and Japan . Shanghai fell after a three - month battle during which Japan suffered extensive casualties , both in its army and navy . The capital of Nanjing fell in December 1937 . It was followed by an orgy of mass murders and rapes known as the Nanjing Massacre . The national capital was briefly at Wuhan , then removed in an epic retreat to Chongqing , the seat of government until 1945 . In 1940 the collaborationist Wang Jingwei regime was set up with its capital in Nanjing , proclaiming itself the legitimate `` Republic of China '' in opposition to Chiang Kai - shek 's government , though its claims were significantly hampered due to its nature as a Japanese puppet state controlling limited amounts of territory , along with its subsequent defeat at the end of the war .
