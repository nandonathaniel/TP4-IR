In most cells , the cell wall is flexible , meaning that it will bend rather than holding a fixed shape , but has considerable tensile strength . The apparent rigidity of primary plant tissues is enabled by cell walls , but is not due to the walls ' stiffness . Hydraulic turgor pressure creates this rigidity , along with the wall structure . The flexibility of the cell walls is seen when plants wilt , so that the stems and leaves begin to droop , or in seaweeds that bend in water currents . As John Howland explains :
