The modern Conservative Party was created out of the ' Pittite ' Tories of the early 19th century . In the late 1820s disputes over political reform broke up this grouping . A government led by the Duke of Wellington collapsed amidst dire election results . Following this disaster Robert Peel set about assembling a new coalition of forces . Peel issued the Tamworth Manifesto in 1834 which set out the basic principles of Conservatism -- the necessity in specific cases of reform in order to survive , but an opposition to unnecessary change , that could lead to `` a perpetual vortex of agitation '' . Meanwhile , the Whigs , along with free trade Tory followers of Robert Peel , and independent Radicals , formed the Liberal Party under Lord Palmerston in 1859 , and transformed into a party of the growing urban middle - class , under the long leadership of William Ewart Gladstone .
