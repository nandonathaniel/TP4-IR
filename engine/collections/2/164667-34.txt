When the NFL began its 40th season in 1960 , it had a new and unwanted rival : the American Football League . The NFL had successfully fended off several other rival leagues in the past , and so the older league initially ignored the new upstart and its eight teams , figuring it would be made up of nothing but NFL rejects , and that fans were unlikely to prefer it to the NFL . But unlike the NFL 's prior rivals , the AFL survived and prospered , in part by signing `` NFL rejects '' who turned out to be highly talented players the older league had badly misjudged . Soon the NFL and AFL found themselves locked in a massive bidding war for the top free agents and prospects coming out of college . Originally , there was a tacit agreement between the two not to raid each other by signing players who were already under contract with a team from an opposing league . This policy broke down in early 1966 when the NFL 's New York Giants signed Pete Gogolak , a placekicker who was under contract with the AFL 's Buffalo Bills . The AFL owners considered this an `` act of war '' and immediately struck back , signing several contracted NFL players , including eight of their top quarterbacks .
