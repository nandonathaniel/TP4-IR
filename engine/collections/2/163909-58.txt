The Tigers constructed Bennett Park at the corner of Michigan Avenue and Trumbull Avenue in Corktown ( just west of Downtown Detroit ) and began playing there in 1901 . In 1912 , the team moved into Navin Field , which was built on the same location . It was expanded in 1938 and renamed Briggs Stadium . It was renamed Tiger Stadium in 1961 and the Tigers played there until moving to Comerica Park in 2000 .
