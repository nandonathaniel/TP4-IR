The Foundation update also adds in two new play modes , with the original gameplay considered as the third , default mode . Survival mode is similar to standard gameplay but the difficulty is much higher -- atmospheric effects have larger impact on the exosuit 's armour , alien creatures are more hostile , Sentinels are more alert and deadly , and resources tend to be sparse . If a player should die in Survival mode , they must restart without being able to recover their lost progress , though they still possess their credits , alien language progress , and known blueprints . Creative mode removes much of the mechanics that can kill the player 's character , and gives them unlimited resources for constructing bases .
