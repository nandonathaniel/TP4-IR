The early advances in weaving had been halted by the lack of thread . The spinning process was slow and the weavers needed more cotton and wool thread than their families could produce . In the 1760s , James Hargreaves improved thread production when he invented the Spinning Jenny . By the end of the decade , Richard Arkwright had developed the water frame . This invention had two important consequences : it improved the quality of the thread , which meant that the cotton industry was no longer dependent on wool or linen to make the warp , and it took spinning away from the artisans ' homes to specific locations where fast - flowing streams could provide the water power needed to drive the larger machines . The Western Pennines of Lancashire became the centre for the cotton industry . Not long after the invention of the water frame , Samuel Crompton combined the principals of the Spinning Jenny and the Water Frame to produce his Spinning Mule . This provided even tougher and finer cotton thread .
