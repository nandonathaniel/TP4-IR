Seed dormancy has two main functions : the first is synchronizing germination with the optimal conditions for survival of the resulting seedling ; the second is spreading germination of a batch of seeds over time so a catastrophe ( e.g. late frosts , drought , herbivory ) does not result in the death of all offspring of a plant ( bet - hedging ) . Seed dormancy is defined as a seed failing to germinate under environmental conditions optimal for germination , normally when the environment is at a suitable temperature with proper soil moisture . This true dormancy or innate dormancy is therefore caused by conditions within the seed that prevent germination . Thus dormancy is a state of the seed , not of the environment . Induced dormancy , enforced dormancy or seed quiescence occurs when a seed fails to germinate because the external environmental conditions are inappropriate for germination , mostly in response to conditions being too dark or light , too cold or hot , or too dry .
