In March 2003 , the club 's board of directors advised the shareholders of Glentoran Recreation Company Ltd to sell the Oval to a property development holding company called Girona . To date no new ground has materialised . A campaign waged by a group of volunteer supporters called Rest In East , was then set up to keep the club in east Belfast . The club 's Board of directors have suggested moving close to a town called Comber , well outside the city bounds of Belfast , which the majority of supporters firmly oppose .
