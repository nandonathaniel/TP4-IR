The first published version of what is almost the present tune appeared in 1744 in Thesaurus Musicus . The 1744 version of the song was popularised in Scotland and England the following year , with the landing of Charles Edward Stuart and was published in The Gentleman 's Magazine ( see illustration above ) . This manuscript has the tune depart from that which is used today at several points , one as early as the first bar , but is otherwise clearly a strong relative of the contemporary anthem . It was recorded as being sung in London theatres in 1745 , with , for example , Thomas Arne writing a setting of the tune for the Drury Lane Theatre .
