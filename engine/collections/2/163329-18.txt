The scientific community regards flood geology as pseudoscience because it contradicts a variety of facts in geology , stratigraphy , geophysics , physics , paleontology , biology , anthropology , and archeology . Modern geology , its sub-disciplines and other scientific disciplines utilize the scientific method to analyze the geology of the earth . Scientific analysis refutes the key tenets of flood geology , which , as an idea , is in contradiction to scientific consensus . Modern geology relies on a number of established principles , one of the most important of which is Charles Lyell 's principle of uniformitarianism . In relation to geological forces , uniformitarianism holds that the shaping of the Earth has occurred by means of mostly slow - acting forces that can be seen in operation today . In general , there is a lack of any evidence for any of the above effects proposed by flood geologists , and scientists do not take their claims of fossil - layering seriously .
