Before 1968 the appointment of a Privy Chamberlain expired at the death of the Pope who granted it . This no longer holds . Those listed in the index of the Annuario Pontificio as Chaplains of His Holiness continue to be listed in the edition that follow the death of the Pope , as after the deaths of Popes Paul VI and John Paul I in 1978 and after that of Pope John Paul II in 2005 .
