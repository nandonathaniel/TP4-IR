The exterior shots reused the original shop from the series , on Lister Avenue in Balby , a suburb of Doncaster . The shop had to be extensively redressed ( for both programmes ) to resemble a traditional corner shop , as it has been a hair salon since 1962 . This process took two days , before filming on location for three consecutive days .
