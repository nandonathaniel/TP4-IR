A population - based study of the incidence of MRSA infections in San Francisco during 2004 -- 05 demonstrated that nearly 1 in 300 residents suffered from such an infection in the course of a year and that greater than 85 % of these infections occurred outside of the healthcare setting . A 2004 study showed that people in the United States with S. aureus infection had , on average , three times the length of hospital stay ( 14.3 vs. 4.5 days ) , incurred three times the total cost ( $48,824 vs. $14,141 ) , and experienced five times the risk of in - hospital death ( 11.2 % vs 2.3 % ) than people without this infection . In a meta - analysis of 31 studies , Cosgrove et al. , concluded that MRSA bacteremia is associated with increased mortality as compared with MSSA bacteremia ( odds ratio = 1.93 ; 95 % CI = 1.93 Â± 0.39 ) . In addition , Wyllie et al. report a death rate of 34 % within 30 days among people infected with MRSA , a rate similar to the death rate of 27 % seen among MSSA - infected people .
