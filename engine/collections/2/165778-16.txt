Exxon Shipping Company failed to supervise the master and provide a rested and sufficient crew for Exxon Valdez . The NTSB found this was widespread throughout the industry , prompting a safety recommendation to Exxon and to the industry . The third mate failed to properly maneuver the vessel , possibly due to fatigue or excessive workload . Exxon Shipping Company failed to properly maintain the Raytheon Collision Avoidance System ( RAYCAS ) radar , which , if functional , would have indicated to the third mate an impending collision with the Bligh Reef by detecting the `` radar reflector '' , placed on the next rock inland from Bligh Reef for the purpose of keeping ships on course . This cause has only been identified by Greg Palast ( without evidentiary support ) and is not present in the official accident report .
