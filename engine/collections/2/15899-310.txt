Chongqing was separated from Sichuan province and made into a municipality in its own right in 14 March 1997 in order to accelerate its development and subsequently China 's relatively poorer western areas ( see China Western Development strategy ) . An important industrial area in western China , Chongqing is also rapidly urbanising . For instance , statistics suggest that new construction added approximately 137,000 square metres ( 1,470,000 square feet ) daily of usable floor space to satisfy demands for residential , commercial and factory space . In addition , more than 1,300 people moved into the city daily , adding almost 100 million yuan ( US $15 million ) to the local economy .
