In 2002 Darren Lund , a professor at the University of Calgary , filed a complaint against Reverend Stephen Boissoin and the Concerned Christian Coalition with the Alberta Human Rights Commission , alleging that Boisson 's letter to the Red Deer Advocate was `` likely to expose homosexuals to hatred and / or contempt . '' The Alberta Human Rights Panel found that Boissoin and the Coalition had infringed the hate publication provision of the Alberta Human Rights Act . The Panel ordered Boissoin and the Coalition to cease publishing disparaging remarks about gays and homosexuals ; to apologize to Lund ; to pay $5,000 in damages to Lund ; and to pay costs , up to $2,000 . The decision was overturned in 2009 when the Alberta Court of Queen 's Bench found that the contents of the letter did not violate the hate publication provision of the Alberta Human Rights Act ; that there was no evidence to support a finding against the Coalition ; and that the remedies which had been imposed were either unlawful or unconstitutional . The court 's decision was upheld by the Alberta Court of Appeal in 2012 . In February 2006 , Calgary Sufi Muslim leader Syed Soharwardy filed a human rights complaint against Western Standard publisher Ezra Levant . Levant was compelled to appear before the Alberta Human Rights Commission to discuss his intention in publishing the Muhammad cartoons . Levant posted a video of the hearing on YouTube . Levant questioned the competence of the Commission to take up the issue , and challenged it to convict him , `` and sentence me to the apology '' , stating that he would then take `` this junk into the real courts , where eight hundred years of common law '' would come to his aid . In February 2008 , Soharwardy dropped the complaint noting that `` most Canadians see this as an issue of freedom of speech , that that principle is sacred and holy in our society . ''
