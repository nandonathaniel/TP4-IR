The predominantly Chinese immigrants who were detained at Angel Island were not welcomed in the United States . As recounted by one detained in 1940 : `` When we arrived , they locked us up like criminals in compartments like the cages at the zoo . '' Held in these `` cages '' for weeks , often months , individuals were subjected to rounds of long and stressful interrogations to assess the legitimacy of their immigration applications . Immigrants were made to recall minute details about their home and claimed relations -- how many steps led up to your front door ? Who lived in the third house in the second row of houses in your village ? The interpreters for the proceedings may have not have spoken the particular dialect of the immigrant competently ; most Chinese immigrants were from southern China at that time , many spoke Cantonese . It was difficult to pass the interrogations , and cases were appealed many times over before one could leave the island and enter the United States . Often , successful immigrants produced elaborate instruction manuals that coached fellow detainees in passing interrogations ; if anyone was caught with these manuals , they would most likely be deported . Those that failed these tests often feared the shame of returning to China , and would commit suicide before leaving , or on the ships back to their homeland .
