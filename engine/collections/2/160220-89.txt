Non-stormwater permits typically include numeric effluent limitations for specific pollutants . A numeric limitation quantifies the maximum pollutant load or concentration allowed in the discharge , e.g. , 30 mg / L of biochemical oxygen demand . Exceeding a numeric limitation constitutes a violation of the permit , and the discharger is subject to fines as laid out in section 309 . Facilities must periodically monitor their effluent ( i.e. , collect and analyze wastewater samples ) , and submit Discharge Monitoring Reports to the appropriate agency , to demonstrate compliance . Stormwater permits typically require facilities to prepare a Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan and implement best management practices , but do not specify numeric effluent limits and may not include regular monitoring requirements . Some permits cover both stormwater and non-stormwater discharges . NPDES permits must be reissued every five years . Permit agencies ( EPA , states , tribes ) must provide notice to the public of pending permits and provide an opportunity for public comment .
