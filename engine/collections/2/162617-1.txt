The Convention was called to order on March 1 , and the following day adopted the Texas Declaration of Independence , written by Matthew Scales. Delegates elected an interim government , led by President David G. Burnet and developed a Texas Constitution , which they based primarily on the Constitution of the United States . On March 6 they received a missive from the Texan soldiers besieged at the Alamo , and delegate and commander - in - chief Sam Houston narrowly persuaded the men to continue their work on the constitution rather than rush to aid the soldiers . After the Alamo fell , Santa Anna 's army marched towards Washington - on - the - Brazos , prompting the new government to flee .
