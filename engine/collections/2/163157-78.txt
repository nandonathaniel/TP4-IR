Although Huntington 's has been recognized as a disorder since at least the Middle Ages , the cause has been unknown until fairly recently . Huntington 's was given different names throughout this history as understanding of the disease changed . Originally called simply ' chorea ' for the jerky dancelike movements associated with the disease , HD has also been called `` hereditary chorea '' and `` chronic progressive chorea '' . The first definite mention of HD was in a letter by Charles Oscar Waters , published in the first edition of Robley Dunglison 's Practice of Medicine in 1842 . Waters described `` a form of chorea , vulgarly called magrums '' , including accurate descriptions of the chorea , its progression , and the strong heredity of the disease . In 1846 Charles Gorman observed how higher prevalence seemed to occur in localized regions . Independently of Gorman and Waters , both students of Dunglison at Jefferson Medical College in Philadelphia , Johan Christian Lund also produced an early description in 1860 . He specifically noted that in Setesdalen , a secluded mountain valley in Norway , there was a high prevalence of dementia associated with a pattern of jerking movement disorders that ran in families .
