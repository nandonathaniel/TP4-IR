Ana Grilo in Kirkus Reviews describes the book as being ' Groundhog Day on Red Bull ' , it ' raises a lot of questions . It features an intriguing premise to start with and the fact that Harry is a member of a group of people who undergo the same process every time they die is all the more fascinating : Who are they ? Why are they like that ? ... Are they living in exactly the same world every time ? Or is every life a wholly new one lived in an alternate universe ? ' . Grilo does though criticize Harry 's narrative voice : ' Mostly , he experiences life with a strong sense of detachment , a blankness that is partly due to survival instinct , partly due to the fact that he is mnemonic . This blankness unfortunately seeps into the narrative . ' and she concludes ' inasmuch as the plot is engaging and I was driven to find out how would Harry sort out the impending apocalypse , the question of authenticity of the narrative mode and the blankness of Harry as a character considerably detracted from the overall experience .
