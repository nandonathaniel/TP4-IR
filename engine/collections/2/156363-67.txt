Many slaves were brought to Arkansas by planters looking to cash in on the Arkansas delta 's fertile lands . The most capable male slaves were often separated from their families and relocated to the swamps of southeast Arkansas . These swamplands were poorly drained , and many planters required their slaves to work long hours clearing trees from the swamps by hand . Slaves were forced to live in cramped slave quarters in the densely forested swamps , surrounded by disease - carrying mosquitoes . Conditions were brutal ; slaves often received only one pair of clothes per year , given on Christmas by the planter family . Diets consisted of only fatback and cornmeal , usually lacking in vegetables and other necessities to stave off deficiencies .
