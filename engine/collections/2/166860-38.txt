Throne of Blood , a Japanese version filmed in 1958 by Akira Kurosawa , replaces the Three Witches with the Forest Spirit , an old hag who sits at her spinning wheel , symbolically entrapping Macbeth 's equivalent , Washizu , in the web of his own ambition . She lives outside `` The Castle of the Spider 's Web '' , another reference to Macbeth 's entanglement in her trap . Behind her hut , Washizu finds piles of rotting bones . The hag , the spinning wheel , and the piles of bones are direct references to the Noh play Adachigahara ( also called Kurozuka ) , one of many artistic elements Kurosawa borrowed from Noh theatre for the film .
