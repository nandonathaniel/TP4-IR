Requirements for joining the WCTU include paying membership dues and signing a pledge to abstain from alcohol . The pledge of the Southern Californian WCTU , for example , is `` I hereby solemnly promise , God helping me , to abstain from all distilled , fermented , and malt liquors , including beer , wine , and hard cider , and to employ all proper means to discourage the use of and traffic in the same . '' Current issues for the WCTU include alcohol , which the organization considers to be North America 's number one drug problem , as well as illegal drugs , and abortion . The WCTU has warned against the dangers of tobacco since 1875 . They continue to this day in their fight against those substances they see as harmful to society .
