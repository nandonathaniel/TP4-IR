The United States Internal Revenue Service has excluded some regulations such as Alternative Minimum Tax ( AMT ) from tax treaties that protect double taxation . In its current format even if US citizens are paying income taxes at a rate of 56 % , far above the maximum US marginal tax rate , the citizen can be subject to US taxes because the calculation of the Alternative Minimum Tax does not allow full deduction for taxes paid to a foreign country . Other regulations such as the post date of foreign mailed tax returns are not recognized and can result in penalties for late filing if they arrive at the IRS later than the filing date . However , the filing date for overseas citizens has a two - month automatic extension to June 15 .
