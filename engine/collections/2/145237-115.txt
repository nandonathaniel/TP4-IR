The Assemblies of God has its roots in the Pentecostal Azusa Street Revival of the early 20th century . The Pentecostal aspects of the revival were not generally welcomed by established churches , and participants in the movement soon found themselves forced outside existing religious bodies . These people sought out their own places of worship and founded hundreds of distinctly Pentecostal congregations . By 1914 , many ministers and laymen alike began to realize just how far - reaching the spread of the revival and of Pentecostalism had become . Concerned leaders felt the desire to protect and preserve the results of the revival by uniting through cooperative fellowship .
