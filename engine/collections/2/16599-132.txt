Harrison performed `` My Sweet Lord '' at every one of his relatively few solo concerts , starting with the two Concert for Bangladesh shows at New York 's Madison Square Garden on 1 August 1971 . The recording released on the subsequent live album was taken from the evening show and begins with Harrison 's spoken `` Hare Krishna '' over his opening acoustic - guitar chords . Among the 24 backing musicians was a `` Soul Choir '' featuring singers Claudia Linnear , Dolores Hall and Jo Green , but it was Harrison who sung the end - of - song Guru Stotram prayer in his role as lead vocalist , unlike on the studio recording ( where it was sung by the backing chorus ) ; the slide guitar parts were played by Eric Clapton and Jesse Ed Davis .
