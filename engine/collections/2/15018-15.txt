Osment first achieved stardom in 1999 , when he appeared in The Sixth Sense , co-starring Bruce Willis . For his portrayal of Cole Sear , a psychic child , Osment won the Saturn Award for Best Performance by a Younger Actor . He was also nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor , becoming the second - youngest performer ever to receive an Academy nomination for a supporting role , but lost the final Oscar vote to Michael Caine ( with whom he would later work , appearing together in Secondhand Lions ) . One of Osment 's lines in The Sixth Sense , `` I see dead people , '' became a popular catchphrase and is often repeated or parodied on television programs and in other media . The phrase is # 44 on the American Film Institute 's list of 100 Movie Quotes . He made three minor ( voice - only ) guest appearances on the animated TV series Family Guy in 2000 and 2001 .
