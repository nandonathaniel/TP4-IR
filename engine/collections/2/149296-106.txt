Persistent ( or common ) figs have all female flowers that do not need pollination for fruiting ; the fruit can develop through parthenocarpic means . This is a popular horticulture fig for home gardeners . Dottato ( Kadota ) , Black Mission , Brown Turkey , Brunswick , and Celeste are some representative cultivars . Caducous ( or Smyrna ) figs require cross pollination by the fig wasp with pollen from caprifigs for the fruit to mature . If not pollinated the immature fruits drop . Some cultivars are Marabout , Inch√†rio , and Zidi . Intermediate ( or San Pedro ) figs set an unpollinated breba crop but need pollination for the later main crop . Examples are Lampeira , King , and San Pedro .
