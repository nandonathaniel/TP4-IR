Radical nationalism in Italy -- support for expansionism and cultural revolution to create a `` New Man '' and a `` New State '' -- began to grow in 1912 during the Italian conquest of Libya and was supported by Italian Futurists and members of the ANI . Futurism that was both an artistic - cultural movement and initially a political movement in Italy led by Filippo Tommaso Marinetti who founded the Futurist Manifesto ( 1908 ) , that championed the causes of modernism , action and political violence as necessary elements of politics while denouncing liberalism and parliamentary politics . Marinetti rejected conventional democracy for based on majority rule and egalitarianism while promoting a new form of democracy , that he described in his work `` The Futurist Conception of Democracy '' as the following : `` We are therefore able to give the directions to create and to dismantle to numbers , to quantity , to the mass , for with us number , quantity and mass will never be -- as they are in Germany and Russia -- the number , quantity and mass of mediocre men , incapable and indecisive '' . The ANI claimed that liberal democracy was no longer compatible with the modern world and advocated a strong state and imperialism , claiming that humans are naturally predatory and that nations were in a constant struggle , in which only the strongest could survive .
