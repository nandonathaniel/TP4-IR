The high temperature of annealing may result in oxidation of the metal 's surface , resulting in scale . If scale must be avoided , annealing is carried out in a special atmosphere , such as with endothermic gas ( a mixture of carbon monoxide , hydrogen gas , and nitrogen gas ) . Annealing is also done in forming gas , a mixture of hydrogen and nitrogen .
