The first recorded European sighting of the Australian mainland , and the first recorded European landfall on the Australian continent ( in 1606 ) , are attributed to the Dutch . The first ship and crew to chart the Australian coast and meet with Aboriginal people was the Duyfken captained by Dutch navigator , Willem Janszoon . He sighted the coast of Cape York Peninsula in early 1606 , and made landfall on 26 February at the Pennefather River near the modern town of Weipa on Cape York . The Dutch charted the whole of the western and northern coastlines and named the island continent `` New Holland '' during the 17th century , but made no attempt at settlement . William Dampier , an English explorer and privateer , landed on the north - west coast of New Holland in 1688 and again in 1699 on a return trip . In 1770 , James Cook sailed along and mapped the east coast , which he named New South Wales and claimed for Great Britain .
