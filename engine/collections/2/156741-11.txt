Mangrove swamps protect coastal areas from erosion , storm surge ( especially during hurricanes ) , and tsunamis . The mangroves ' massive root systems are efficient at dissipating wave energy . Likewise , they slow down tidal water enough so its sediment is deposited as the tide comes in , leaving all except fine particles when the tide ebbs . In this way , mangroves build their own environments . Because of the uniqueness of mangrove ecosystems and the protection against erosion they provide , they are often the object of conservation programs , including national biodiversity action plans .
