As Cory teaches his class about the value of money , and Stuart makes a risky investment on new technology for Minkus International , Farkle becomes concerned about being poor and starts seeing there is greater value to his friendships and family than money and material things can give . Cory goes further into his money lesson by emphasizing there is a large part of the world that is less fortunate , revealing a greater `` secret of life '' : kindness and charity toward others . Cory challenges the class to come up with ideas for using money to help those in need , but this prompts Farkle to leave class immediately and to talk to his father about their relationship and his company 's purpose , saying he needs to do more for the rest of the world . So Stuart begins a charitable organization and looks to give away money for a charitable cause . With help from NBA owner Mark Cuban , Stuart , Cory and Topanga listen to Riley , Lucas , Maya and Farkle about how they would help the less fortunate . Ultimately , on Farkle 's request , Stuart and Mark invest on Maya , who lives in need and appreciates all she has been given . Meanwhile , Auggie worries about his father when he does not receive his whole allowance , but learns the importance of Cory 's contributions as a teacher , despite being paid less than Topanga .
