Film critic Roger Ebert gave the film 3.5 stars out of four and wrote , `` If ( F . ) Scott Fitzgerald were to return to life , he would feel at home in a Whit Stillman movie . Stillman listens to how people talk , and knows what it reveals about them '' . In her review for The New York Times , Janet Maslin praised Chris Eigeman 's performance : `` Mr. Eigeman makes the filmmaker a perfect mouthpiece who can brood amusingly about anything , no matter how petty . Here he plumbs the psychological subtext of Lady and the Tramp '' . Andrew Sarris , in his review for The New York Observer , wrote , `` Mr. Stillman 's free ticket with the critics for the seemingly magical minimalism of Metropolitan has long since expired . In his future projects , all the charm and buoyancy in the world may not compensate for a lack of structure and bedrock reality '' .
