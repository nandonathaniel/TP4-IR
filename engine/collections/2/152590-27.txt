Sodhe Matha sent legal notices to the film 's producers in early January 2014 about the film 's title Baahubali which is the name of a revered Arihant in Jainism , Bahubali , as they were afraid that the film would portray his story in a violent manner . Days later , Sobhu Yarlagadda defended the story of the film saying `` The film has nothing to do with Gomatheswara or the Jain religion . The story is completely fictional written by Vijayendra Prasad and will remain so . ' Baahubali ' refers to the amount of power the protagonist possesses . '' He also clarified that they have n't received the legal notice yet .
