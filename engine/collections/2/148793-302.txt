Orange is the national colour of the Netherlands . The royal family , the House of Orange - Nassau , derives its name in part from its former holding , the principality of Orange . ( The title Prince of Orange is still used for the Dutch heir apparent . ) The Republic of the Orange Free State ( Dutch : Oranje - Vrijstaat ) was an independent Boer republic in southern Africa during the second half of the 19th century , and later a British colony and a province of the Union of South Africa . It is the historical precursor to the present - day Free State province . Extending between the Orange and Vaal river , its borders were determined by the United Kingdom in 1848 when the region was proclaimed as the Orange River Sovereignty , with a seat of a British Resident in Bloemfontein . Oranjemund ( German for : `` Mouth of Oranje '' ) is a town situated in the extreme southwest of Namibia , on the northern bank of the Orange River mouth .
