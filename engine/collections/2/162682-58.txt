Zidane and France went on to play against defending champions and favourites Brazil at the Stade de France in the 1998 FIFA World Cup Final . France dominated Brazil from the kick - off , with Zidane scoring two similar goals , both headers from corner kicks taken by Emmanuel Petit and Youri Djorkaeff . Courtesy of Zidane 's two goals , France went into the half - time break 2 -- 0 up with one hand already on the World Cup trophy . Petit added a third goal deep in stoppage time to seal the 3 -- 0 win and France 's first ever World Cup . Zidane became an instant national hero , and over one million people celebrated the victory on the Champs - Élysées where a huge image of Zidane was projected on the Arc de Triomphe along with the words `` Merci Zizou '' .
