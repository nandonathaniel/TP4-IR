The earliest known depiction of carnivorous plants in popular culture was a case wherein a large man - eating tree was reported to have consumed a young woman in Madagascar in 1878 . The South Australian Register carried the story in 1881 . It was accompanied by an illustration of the tree consuming the woman , said to be a member from the `` little known but cruel tribe '' called the Mkodos . The story was attributed to a Dr. Carl Liche who supposedly witnessed the event . The account has been debunked as pure myth as it appears Dr. Liche , the Mkodos , and the tree were all fabrications .
