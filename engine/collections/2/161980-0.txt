Literature in World War I is generally thought to include poems , novels and drama ; diaries , letters , and memoirs are often included in this category as well . Although the canon continues to be challenged , the texts most frequently taught in schools and universities are lyrics by Siegfried Sassoon and Wilfred Owen ; poems by Ivor Gurney , Edward Thomas , Charles Sorley , David Jones and Isaac Rosenberg are also widely anthologised . Many of the works during and about the war were written by men , because of the war 's intense demand on the young men of that generation ; however , a number of women ( especially in the British tradition ) created literature about the war , often observing the effects of the war on soldiers , domestic spaces , and the homefront more generally .
