In 2001 , Barry Bonds established the current record of 73 home runs in a single season . There had long been suspicions that the dramatic increase in power hitting was fueled in large part by the abuse of illegal steroids ( as well as by the dilution of pitching talent due to expansion ) , but the issue only began attracting significant media attention in 2002 and there was no penalty for the use of performance - enhancing drugs before 2004 . In 2007 , Bonds became MLB 's all - time home run leader , surpassing Hank Aaron , as total major league and minor league attendance both reached all - time highs .
