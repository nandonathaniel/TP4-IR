Captain Jack Sparrow has become one of the most iconic film characters of all time . When Dead Man 's Chest grossed over $1 billion worldwide , Ian Nathan attributed this to Sparrow 's popularity : `` Pirates , the franchise , only had to turn up . There was a powerful holdover from the cheeky delights of its debut , something we had n't felt since the Clone Wars called it a day . '' Empire in 2006 declared Depp 's performance the seventy - fourth `` thing that rocked our world '' and later named him the eighth greatest movie character of all time . In 2015 , a new poll of the 100 greatest film characters of all time placed him as the fourteenth greatest . A survey of more than 3,000 people showed Jack Sparrow was the most popular Halloween costume of 2006 , and a 2007 poll held by the Internet Movie Database showed Sparrow to be the second most popular live action hero after Indiana Jones . In a 2007 Pearl & Dean poll , Jack Sparrow was listed as Depp 's most popular performance .
