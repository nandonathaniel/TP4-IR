Vampire , Predator , Terminator , Zombie - A common family of variations derived from simple `` elimination '' games , players split into two uneven teams . Depending on the variant , the team with fewer players is given some advantage reducing that team 's ability to be eliminated from the game . `` Vampires '' , for instance , may turn players from the other `` Hunter '' team into Vampire players by shooting them . `` Terminators '' or `` Predators '' may require a hit in a certain area , such as the facemask , to be eliminated , while other hits do n't count . `` Zombies '' may have both advantages and disadvantages ; they may require multiple hits and be able to convert players from the other team , but may also have a disadvantage such as being required to walk , or to `` convert '' players by tapping them with the barrel instead of marking them with a paintball .
