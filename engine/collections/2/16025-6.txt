Multicellular organisms arise in various ways , for example by cell division or by aggregation of many single cells . Colonial organisms are the result of many identical individuals joining together to form a colony . However , it can often be hard to separate colonial protists from true multicellular organisms , because the two concepts are not distinct ; colonial protists have been dubbed `` pluricellular '' rather than `` multicellular '' .
