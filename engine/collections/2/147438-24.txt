In one episode , `` The Secret of Snow '' , the episode does not start off in the backyard , but on a floor that has a red storybook on it . Also , Austin , though never shown , is the only Backyardigan who makes a physical appearance in the episode ; the other four appear only in the storybook . This is the only time only one of the real Backyardigans appears .
