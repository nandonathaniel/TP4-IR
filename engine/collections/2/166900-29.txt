Ico uses minimal dialog in a fictional language to provide the story throughout the game . Voice actors included Kazuhiro Shind≈ç as Ico , Rieko Takahashi as Yorda , and Misa Watanabe as the Queen . Ico and the Queen 's words are presented in either English or Japanese subtitles depending on the release region , but Yorda 's speech is presented in a symbolic language . Ueda opted not to provide the translation for Yorda 's words as it would have overcome the language barrier between Ico and Yorda , and detracted from the `` holding hands '' concept of the game . In the non-North American releases , playing through the game again after completing the game replaces the symbolic text with appropriate language subtitles .
