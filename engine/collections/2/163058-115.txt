After an IRS settlement offer was rejected by VCCDD , the IRS further expanded its audit in July 2009 to include all recreational and utility revenue bonds issued by VCCDD as well as similar bonds issued by Sumter Landing CDD , on the basis that Sumter Landing CDD is also an `` alter ego '' of the developers . However , the 10 district CDDs were not included in the expanded audit , since as shown above the District CDDs Boards are elected by the residents .
