EternalBlue exploits a vulnerability in Microsoft 's implementation of the Server Message Block ( SMB ) protocol . This Windows vulnerability was not a zero - day flaw , but one for which Microsoft had released a `` critical '' advisory , along with a security patch to fix the vulnerability two months before , on 14 March 2017 . The patch was to the Server Message Block ( SMB ) protocol used by Windows , and fixed several versions of the Microsoft Windows operating system , including Windows Vista , Windows 7 , Windows 8.1 , and Windows 10 , as well as server and embedded versions such as Windows Server 2008 onwards and Windows Embedded POSReady 2009 respectively , but not the older unsupported Windows XP , Windows Server 2003 , and Windows 8 ( unsupported because Windows 8.1 is classified as a mandatory service pack upgrade ) . The day after the WannaCry outbreak Microsoft released updates for these too .
