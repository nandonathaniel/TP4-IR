The Browns wore brown pants for the first time in team history on August 18 , 2008 , preseason game against the New York Giants . The pants contain no stripes or markings . The team had the brown pants created as an option for their away uniform when they integrated the gray facemask in 2006 . They were not worn again until the Browns `` family '' scrimmage on August 9 , 2009 with white - striped socks . The Browns have continued to wear the brown pants throughout the 2009 season . Browns quarterback Brady Quinn supported the team 's move to wearing the brown pants full - time , claiming that the striped pattern on the white pants `` prohibit ( ed ) mobility '' . However , the fans generally did not like the brown pants , and after being used for only one season , the team returned to their white shirt - on - white pants in 2010 . Coach Eric Mangini told The Plain Dealer the Browns wo n't use the brown pants anymore . `` It was n't very well - received , '' Mangini said . `` I hope we can get to the point where we can wear fruit on our heads and people would n't notice . '' At the time , the brown pants were n't officially dropped by the team , but simply not used .
