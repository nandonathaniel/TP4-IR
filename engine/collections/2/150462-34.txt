As computerized engine control units ( ECUs ) became more capable , much of the logic built into the transmission 's valve body was offloaded to the ECU . Some manufacturers use a separate computer dedicated to the transmission called a transmission control unit ( TCU ) , also known as the transmission control module ( TCM ) , which shares information with the engine management computer . In this case , solenoids turned on and off by the computer control shift patterns and gear ratios , rather than the spring - loaded valves in the valve body . This allows for more precise control of shift points , shift quality , lower shift times , and ( on some newer cars ) semi-automatic control , where the driver tells the computer when to shift . The result is an impressive combination of efficiency and smoothness . Some computers even identify the driver 's style and adapt to best suit it .
