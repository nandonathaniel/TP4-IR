Jihad means `` to strive or struggle '' ( in the way of God ) . Jihad , in its broadest sense , is `` exerting one 's utmost power , efforts , endeavors , or ability in contending with an object of disapprobation '' . Depending on the object being a visible enemy , the Devil , and aspects of one 's own self ( such as sinful desires ) , different categories of jihad are defined . Jihad also refers to one 's striving to attain religious and moral perfection . When used without any qualifier , Jihad is understood in its military form . Some Muslim authorities , especially among the Shi'a and Sufis , distinguish between the `` greater jihad '' , which pertains to spiritual self - perfection , and the `` lesser jihad '' , defined as warfare .
