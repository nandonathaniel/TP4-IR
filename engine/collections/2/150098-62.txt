The international home release structure of Dragon Ball Z is complicated by the licensing and release of the companies involved in producing and distributing the work . Releases of the media occurred on both VHS and DVD with separate edited and uncut versions being released simultaneously . Both versions of the edited and uncut material are treated as different entries and would frequently make Billboard rankings as separate entries . Home release sales were featured prominently on the Nielsen VideoScan charts . Further complicating the release of the material was Funimation itself ; which was known to release `` DVDs out of sequence in order to get them out as fast as possible '' ; as in the case of their third season . Pioneer Entertainment distributed the Funimation / Saban edited - only dub of 53 episodes on seventeen VHS between 1997 and 1999 , and seventeen DVDs throughout 1999 . Two box sets separating them into the Saiyan and Namek arcs were also released on VHS in 1999 , and on DVD in 2001 . Funimation 's own distribution of their initial in - house dub , which began with episode 54 , in edited or uncut VHS ran between 2000 and 2003 . A DVD version was produced alongside these , although they were only produced uncut and contained the option to watch the original Japanese with subtitles .
