The area formerly occupied by Five Points was gradually redeveloped through the twentieth century . In the west and south , it is occupied by major federal , state , and city administration buildings and courthouses known collectively as Civic Center , Manhattan . In addition Columbus Park , Collect Pond Park , Foley Square , and various facilities of the New York City Department of Corrections are clustered around lower Centre Street . The corrections facilities are the most direct link to the neighborhood 's past : the infamous The Tombs jail / prison , in which many criminals from Five Points were incarcerated and quite a few executed , stood near the site of the current `` City Prison Manhattan '' at 125 White Street . The northeastern and eastern portion of Five Points is now within the sprawling Chinatown . Many tenement buildings dating from the late 19th century still line the streets in this area .
