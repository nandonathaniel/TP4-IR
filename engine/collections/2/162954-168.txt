In many states , the office of justice of the peace has been abolished or transferred to another court , such as the magistrate court . In larger cities , cases may be heard in a municipal court which has jurisdiction only within that city . Most efforts to abolish the office of justice of the peace have been led by the American Bar Association , which views non-lawyer judges as no longer necessary , as there are now far more persons with formal legal education than in the past when justices of the peace were first used .
