The player starts the game with a Command Center , a scout , and three workers ( in a normal random map game ) for whichever of the six original factions they choose . The player search and gather resources such as Food , Carbon , Nova Crystals , and Ore and then using the resources in order to create new buildings , units , workers and so on . Food is used for low - end units and troopers , as well as the work force . Carbon is used in place of Wood in Age of Empires 2 for buildings and artillery . Nova Crystals create the more high - end units and can be gathered through getting special `` holocrons '' ( from Relics in AoE 2 ) . Ore is used for defensive structures as well as the Gungan unique unit Fambaa . The player can build separate units at separate buildings designed specifically for different types of units . The player can advance through the four Tech Levels by paying a certain amount of resources . When a player advances a Tech Level , more units , buildings , and upgrades become available .
