Hall effect sensors are readily available from a number of different manufacturers , and may be used in various sensors such as rotating speed sensors ( bicycle wheels , gear - teeth , automotive speedometers , electronic ignition systems ) , fluid flow sensors , current sensors , and pressure sensors . Common applications are often found where a robust and contactless switch or potentiometer is required . These include : electric airsoft guns , triggers of electropneumatic paintball guns , go - cart speed controls , smart phones , and some global positioning systems .
