Section 119 concerns the appearance of the accused in a magistrate 's court on a charge requiring trial in High Court . Sometimes the prosecutor uses Chapter 19 to secure a preliminary plea from the accused in the Magistrate 's Court . The prosecutor may put the charge to the accused , even if such charge is not triable in the magistrate 's court . The prosecutor must have written authority from the DPP to take this step . The State not obliged to go this route to get case to the High Court for trial . It may rely instead on section 75 .
