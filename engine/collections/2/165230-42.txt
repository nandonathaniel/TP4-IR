Despite popular lore , it seems unlikely that Drake reached Cape Horn or the eponymous Drake Passage , because his descriptions do not fit the first and his shipmates denied having seen an open sea . The first report of his discovery of an open channel south of Tierra del Fuego was written after the 1618 publication of the voyage of Willem Schouten and Jacob le Maire around Cape Horn in 1616 .
