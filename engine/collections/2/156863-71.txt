The metopes , separate individual tableaux that could usually not contain more than three figures each , usually depicted individual scenes belonging to a broader context . It is rare for scenes to be distributed over several metopes ; instead , a general narrative context , usually a battle , is created by the combination of multiple isolated scenes . Other thematical contexts could be depicted in this fashion . For example , the metopes at the front and back of the Temple of Zeus at Olympia depicted the Twelve Labours of Heracles . Individual mythological scenes , like the abduction of Europa or a cattle raid by the Dioscuri could be thus depicted , as could scenes from the voyage of the Argonauts or the Trojan War . The battles against the centaurs and Amazons , as well as the gigantomachy , all three depicted on the Parthenon , were recurring themes on many temples .
