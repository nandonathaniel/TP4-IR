In May 2016 , Apple significantly redesigned its Union Square Apple Store in downtown San Francisco , adding large glass doors for the entry , open spaces with touch - sensitive tables and shelves for product displays , and rebranded rooms for the store . `` The Avenue '' is the central location for hardware , as well as for receiving advice from salespersons and `` Creative Pros '' - individuals with specialized knowledge of music , creativity , apps and photography . The `` Genius Bar '' becomes the `` Genius Grove '' , a tree - lined area for help and support . `` The Forum '' features a large video screen and offers game nights , sessions with experts in creative arts , and community events . `` The Boardroom '' lets aspiring developers and entrepreneurs learn how to use their products to their full potential . `` The Plaza '' , while limited to select locations , offers a `` park - like '' space outside the store featuring free 24 / 7 Wi - Fi access and will host live concerts on some weekends . Designed by Jony Ive and Angela Ahrendts , the idea was to make Apple Stores into `` town squares '' , in which people come naturally to the store as a gathering place , and to `` help foster human experiences that draw people out of their digital bubbles '' . The new design will be adopted to every store Apple has , and while renovation is undergoing , stores are either relocated or temporarily closed . For some locations , including its flagship Fifth Avenue store in New York City , the redesign means substantial expansion of space , requiring dismantling , and possibly reworking , of its physical properties .
