Likewise , a Prime Minister is no longer just `` first amongst equals '' in HM Government ; although theoretically the Cabinet might still outvote the PM , in practice the PM progressively entrenches his or her position by retaining only personal supporters in the Cabinet . In occasional reshuffles , the Prime Minister can sideline and simply drop from Cabinet the Members who have fallen out of favour : they remain Privy Counsellors , but the Prime Minister decides which of them are summoned to meetings . The Prime Minister is responsible for producing and enforcing the Ministerial Code .
