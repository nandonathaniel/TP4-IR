Odysseus was curious as to what the Sirens sang to him , and so , on the advice of Circe , he had all of his sailors plug their ears with beeswax and tie him to the mast . He ordered his men to leave him tied tightly to the mast , no matter how much he would beg . When he heard their beautiful song , he ordered the sailors to untie him but they bound him tighter . When they had passed out of earshot , Odysseus demonstrated with his frowns to be released . Some post-Homeric authors state that the Sirens were fated to die if someone heard their singing and escaped them , and that after Odysseus passed by they therefore flung themselves into the water and perished .
