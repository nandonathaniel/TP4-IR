Several years later , in 88 BC , a Roman army was sent to put down an emerging Asian power , king Mithridates of Pontus . The army , however , was not defeated and won . One of Marius ' old quaestors , Lucius Cornelius Sulla , had been elected consul for the year , and was ordered by the senate to assume command of the war against Mithridates . Marius , a member of the `` populares '' party , had a tribune revoke Sulla 's command of the war against Mithridates . Sulla , a member of the aristocratic ( `` optimates '' ) party , brought his army back to Italy and marched on Rome . Sulla was so angry at Marius ' tribune that he passed a law intended to permanently weaken the tribunate . He then returned to his war against Mithridates . With Sulla gone , the populares under Marius and Lucius Cornelius Cinna soon took control of the city .
