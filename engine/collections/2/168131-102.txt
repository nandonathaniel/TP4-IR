England 's third goal was referenced in a 2006 Adidas advertisement , where English midfielder Frank Lampard takes a shot at German keeper Oliver Kahn , and a similar event happens . On 27 June 2010 at that year 's World Cup a similar goal by Lampard was wrongly disallowed ( TV replays showed the ball landing past the goal line before bouncing away ) which would have levelled the second - round game against Germany 2 -- 2 ( Germany won 4 -- 1 ) . Kenneth Wolstenholme 's commentary on the third goal that bounced on the line , `` It 's a goal ! '' was used ( along with the sound of breaking glass ) in the tape - looped coda of an early version of The Beatles song `` Glass Onion '' , available on the album Anthology 3 . Kit Kat parodied the controversial third goal in an advert for the Kit Kat bar . The goal is scored and the linesman was shown about to eat a Kit Kat bar as opposed to following the game . Upon realising that a possible goal has been scored , he hastily stuffs the bar into his mouth and awards the goal .
