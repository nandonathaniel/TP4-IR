Traditional arts make up a large section of New Zealand art and include whakairo ( carving ) , raranga ( weaving ) , kapa haka ( group performance ) , whaikorero ( oratory ) , and tā moko ( tattoo ) . Practitioners often follow the techniques of their ancestors , but today Māoritanga also includes contemporary arts such as film , television , poetry and theatre .
