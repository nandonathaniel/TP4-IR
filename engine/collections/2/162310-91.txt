Hoover was by nature an activist and attempted to do what he could to alleviate the widespread suffering caused by the Depression , but his strict adherence to what he believed were Republican principles precluded him from establishing relief directly from the federal government . The Depression cost Hoover the presidency with the 1932 landslide election of Franklin D. Roosevelt . Roosevelt 's New Deal coalition controlled American politics for most of the next three decades , excepting the two - term presidency of Republican Dwight Eisenhower . The Democrats made major gains in the 1930 midterm elections , giving them congressional parity ( though not control ) for the first time since Woodrow Wilson 's presidency .
