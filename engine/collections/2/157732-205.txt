In most institutions , medical education lasts for four years . Basic subjects are taken up in the first and second years , while clinical sciences are studied in the second and third years . In their fourth year , students rotate in the various hospital departments , spending up to two months each in the fields of internal medicine , surgery , obstetrics and gynecology , and pediatrics , and several weeks in the other specialties . After this , students graduate with a Doctorate in Medicine and apply for postgraduate internship ( PGI ) in an accredited hospital of their choice . After PGI , the student is eligible to take the Medical Licensure Examination . Passing the examinations confers the right to practice medicine as well as to apply in a Residency Training Program .
