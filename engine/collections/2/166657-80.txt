After the 1962 season , Raiders managing general partner F. Wayne Valley hired Al Davis as Raiders head coach and general manager . At 33 , he was the youngest person in professional football history to hold the positions . Davis immediately began to implement what he termed the `` vertical game '' , an aggressive offensive strategy inspired by the offense developed by Chargers head coach Sid Gillman . Under Davis the Raiders improved to 10 -- 4 and he was named the AFL 's Coach of the Year in 1963 . Though the team slipped to 5 -- 7 -- 2 in 1964 , they rebounded to an 8 -- 5 -- 1 record in 1965 . The famous silver and black Raider uniform debuted at the regular - season opening game on September 8 , 1963 . Prior to this , the team wore a combination of black and white with gold trim on the pants and oversized numerals .
