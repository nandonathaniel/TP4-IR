In Mexico , the ID number is called the CURP ( Clave Única de Registro de Población ) although the most important and accepted ID card would be the election card ( `` credencial de elector '' or else `` credencial del INE , '' as per the initials of `` Instituto Nacional Electoral / National Institute of Elections , the institution responsible for electoral procedures ) . There are , however , other important ID numbers in Mexico : for instance , the social security number , which is the number assigned by Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social ( Mexican Institute of Social Security , or IMSS ) to every citizen who starts working , or the RFC ( Registro Federal del Contribuyente ) which is assigned by the Treasury and has the same format as the CURP but a shorter length .
