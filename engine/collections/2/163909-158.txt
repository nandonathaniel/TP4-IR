After years of futility , the 2006 season showed signs of hope . The impressive rookie campaigns of eventual American League Rookie of the Year Justin Verlander , centerfielder Curtis Granderson , and flamethrowing relief pitcher Joel Zumaya , coupled with a well - publicized early - season tirade by Leyland , helped the team explode and quickly rise to the top of the AL Central . The team reached a high point when they were 40 games over . 500 , but a second half swoon started to raise questions about the team 's staying power . On August 27 , a 7 -- 1 victory over the Cleveland Indians gave the Tigers their 82nd victory and their first winning season since 1993 . On September 24 , the Tigers beat the Kansas City Royals 11 -- 4 to clinch their first playoff berth since 1987 . A division title seemed inevitable . All that was required was one win in the final five games of the season , which included three games against the Royals , whom the Tigers had manhandled much of the season . However , the Tigers lost all five games to finish 95 -- 67 , and the division title went to the 96 -- 66 Minnesota Twins . The Tigers were the AL wild card winner , the first time a team from the AL Central had won the honor .
