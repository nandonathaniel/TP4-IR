Carrying all this in would not be easy . The postwar demobilisation left the US forces in Europe with only two groups of C - 47 Skytrain transports ( the military version of the Douglas DC - 3 , which the British called `` Dakota '' ) , nominally 96 aircraft , each of which could carry about 3.5 tons of cargo . LeMay believed that `` with an all - out effort '' of 100 daily round trips these would be able to haul about 300 tons of supplies a day . The RAF was somewhat better prepared , since it had already moved some aircraft into the German area , and they expected to be able to supply about 400 tons a day .
