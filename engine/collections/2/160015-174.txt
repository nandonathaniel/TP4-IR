In 1960 , the Institute for Women Protection adopted the Western holiday and established it on 25 Azar ( 16 December ) , the date the Institute was founded . The Institute 's action had the support of Queen Farah Pahlavi , the wife of the last Shah of Persia , who promoted the construction of maternity clinics in remote parts of the country to commemorate the day . The government used the holiday to promote its maternalist view of women . The Shah 's government honored and gave awards to women who represented the idealized view of the regime , including mothers who had many healthy children .
