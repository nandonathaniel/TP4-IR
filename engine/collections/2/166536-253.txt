The Dunning School considered failure inevitable because it felt that taking the right to vote or hold office away from Southern whites was a violation of republicanism . A second school sees the reason for failure as Northern Republicans ' lack of effectiveness in guaranteeing political rights to blacks . A third school blames the failure on not giving land to the freedmen so they could have their own economic base of power . A fourth school sees the major reason for the failure of reconstruction as the states ' inability to suppress the violence of Southern whites when they sought reversal for blacks ' gains . Etcheson ( 2009 ) points to the `` violence that crushed black aspirations and the abandonment by Northern whites of Southern Republicans . '' Etcheson wrote that it is hard to see Reconstruction `` as concluding in anything but failure . '' Etcheson adds , `` W.E.B. DuBois captured that failure well when he wrote in Black Reconstruction in America ( 1935 ) : ' The slave went free ; stood a brief moment in the sun ; then moved back again toward slavery . ' '' Other historians emphasize the failure to fully incorporate Southern Unionists into the Republican coalition .
