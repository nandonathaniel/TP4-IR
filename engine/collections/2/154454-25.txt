For steroid or thyroid hormones , their receptors are located inside the cell within the cytoplasm of the target cell . These receptors belong to the nuclear receptor family of ligand - activated transcription factors . To bind their receptors , these hormones must first cross the cell membrane . They can do so because they are lipid - soluble . The combined hormone - receptor complex then moves across the nuclear membrane into the nucleus of the cell , where it binds to specific DNA sequences , regulating the expression of certain genes , and thereby increasing the levels of the proteins encoded by these genes . However , it has been shown that not all steroid receptors are located inside the cell . Some are associated with the plasma membrane .
