In the books , Elena is considered `` one of the popular girls '' at her high school and always gets `` anything she wants '' . Executive producer of the television show , Julie Plec , said the Elena from the books was `` really kind of selfish '' . In The Vampire Diaries , Elena 's `` selfishness '' in the books as a human was never explored , because it `` did n't ever feel like a characteristic '' the show wanted for their heroine . Plec said `` We kind of abandoned that queen - bee popular complex that in a lot of ways defined early Elena in the books '' , while feeling that Elena 's actual flaw is her `` deep , deep connection to other people '' . In the books , Elena had blonde hair , but has brown hair in the television show . Describing Elena from the books , Dobrev said she is `` one of those mean girls that gets what she wants , popular ... and she 's blonde and blue eyed '' . Williamson told her that `` the angle we wanted to go for was the relatable , nice , girl next door , who the audience roots for '' . Katherine , on the other hand , is penned as a `` conniving , narcissistic , bitch '' . Describing Elena years later , Dobrev said she evolved from a `` younger , naive , sad , young girl '' to a `` strong woman '' .
