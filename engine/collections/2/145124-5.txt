According to etiquette authority Miss Manners , because the party centers on gift - giving , the baby shower is typically arranged and hosted by a close friend rather than a member of the family , since it is considered rude for families to beg for gifts on behalf of their members . However , this custom varies by culture or region and in some it is expected and customary for a close female family member to host the baby shower , often the baby 's grandmother .
