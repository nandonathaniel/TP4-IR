Can something exist without being perceived ? -- e.g. `` is sound only sound if a person hears it ? '' The most immediate philosophical topic that the riddle introduces involves the existence of the tree ( and the sound it produces ) outside of human perception . If no one is around to see , hear , touch or smell the tree , how could it be said to exist ? What is it to say that it exists when such an existence is unknown ? Of course , from a scientific viewpoint , it exists . It is human beings that are able to perceive it . George Berkeley in the 18th century developed subjective idealism , a metaphysical theory to respond to these questions , coined famously as `` to be is to be perceived '' . Today meta - physicists are split . According to substance theory , a substance is distinct from its properties , while according to bundle theory , an object is merely its sense data . The definition of sound , simplified , is a hearable noise . The tree will make a sound , even if nobody heard it . The definition states that sound is a hearable noise . So the tree could have been heard , though nobody was around to do so .
