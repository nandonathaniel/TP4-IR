In February 2015 , McLean announced he would reveal the meaning of the lyrics to the song when the original manuscript went for auction in New York City , in April 2015 . The lyrics and notes were auctioned on April 7 , and sold for $1.2 million . In the sale catalogue notes , McLean revealed the meaning in the song 's lyrics : `` Basically in American Pie things are heading in the wrong direction ... It ( life ) is becoming less idyllic . I do n't know whether you consider that wrong or right but it is a morality song in a sense . '' The catalogue confirmed some of the better known references in the song 's lyrics , including mentions of Elvis Presley ( `` the king '' ) and Bob Dylan ( `` the jester '' ) , and confirmed that the song culminates with a near - verbatim description of the death of Meredith Hunter at the Altamont Free Concert , ten years after the plane crash that killed Holly , Valens , and Richardson .
