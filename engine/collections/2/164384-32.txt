Because pressure was once commonly measured by its ability to displace a column of liquid in a manometer , pressures are often expressed as a depth of a particular fluid ( e.g. , inches of water ) . Manometric measurement is the subject of pressure head calculations . The most common choices for a manometer 's fluid are mercury ( Hg ) and water ; water is nontoxic and readily available , while mercury 's density allows for a shorter column ( and so a smaller manometer ) to measure a given pressure . The abbreviation `` W.C. '' or the words `` water column '' are often printed on gauges and measurements that use water for the manometer .
