Cantillon develops a circular - flow model of the economy that shows the distribution of farm production between property owners , farmers , and workers . Farm production is exchanged for the goods and services produced in the cities by entrepreneurs and artisans . While the property owners are `` independent , '' the model demonstrates the mutual interdependence between all the classes of people that Adam Smith dubbed the `` invisible hand '' in The Theory of Moral Sentiments ( 1759 ) .
