Numbers declined for the 1904 Games in St. Louis , Missouri , United States , due in part to the lengthy transatlantic boat trip required of the European competitors , and the integration with the Louisiana Purchase Exposition World 's Fair , which again spread the event out over an extended period . In contrast with Paris 1900 , the word Olympic was used for practically every contest , including those exclusively for school boys or for Irish - Americans .
