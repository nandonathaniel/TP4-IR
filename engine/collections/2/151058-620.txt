Reinforced forms are likewise common in locative adverbs ( words such as English here and there ) , based on related Latin forms such as hic `` this '' vs. hīc `` here '' , hāc `` this way '' , and ille `` that '' vs. illīc `` there '' , illāc `` that way '' . Here again French prefers bare ecce while Spanish and Italian prefer eccum ( French ici `` here '' vs. Spanish aquí , Italian qui ) . In western languages such as Spanish , Portuguese and Catalan , doublets and triplets arose such as Portuguese aqui , acá , cá `` ( to ) here '' ( accu - hīc , accu - hāc , eccu - hāc ) . From these , a prefix a - was extracted , from which forms like aí `` there ( near you ) '' ( a - ( i ) bi ) and ali `` there ( over yonder ) '' ( a - ( i ) llīc ) were created ; compare Catalan neuter pronouns açò ( acce - hoc ) `` this '' , això ( a - ( i ) psum - hoc ) `` that ( near you ) '' , allò ( a - ( i ) llum - hoc ) `` that ( yonder ) '' .
