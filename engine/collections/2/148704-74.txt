Van Persie scored a team - best four UEFA Euro 2008 qualifying goals , and was deployed as a winger behind lone striker Ruud van Nistelrooy during the tournament after Van Basten decided to change to a 4 -- 2 -- 3 -- 1 formation . As Wesley Sneijder and Rafael van der Vaart were preferred in the midfield , Van Persie was left to battle with Arjen Robben for the remaining spot on the wing . On 13 June , he scored as a 55th - minute substitute in a 4 -- 1 Group C victory over 2006 World Cup finalists France , and started the next match against Romania , scoring off a pass from Demy de Zeeuw with an excellent volley into the back of the net . He finished with two goals as the Netherlands finished atop their group but again suffered a first knock - out round , second stage elimination .
