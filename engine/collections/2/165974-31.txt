Gerry arranged for Holly and her friends Denise and Sharon to travel to his homeland of Ireland . They arrive at their destination , a house in the beautiful Irish countryside where they find letters from Gerry for Sharon & Denise , one asking Denise to take Holly to his favorite pub . While there , they meet William , a singer who strongly reminds Holly of her deceased husband . He asks her to stay to see him after his last song ( `` Galway Girl '' ) , which he dedicates to her . Upon hearing it , she is overcome with emotion and walks out , because it was the song Gerry sang to her shortly after they first met .
