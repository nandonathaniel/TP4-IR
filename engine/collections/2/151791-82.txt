The ability to ask questions is considered by some to distinguish language from non-human systems of communication . Some captive primates ( notably bonobos and chimpanzees ) , having learned to use rudimentary signing to communicate with their human trainers , proved able to respond correctly to complex questions and requests . Yet they failed to ask even the simplest questions themselves . Conversely , human children are able to ask their first questions ( using only question intonation ) at the babbling period of their development , long before they start using syntactic structures . Although babies from different cultures acquire native languages from their social environment , all languages of the world without exception -- tonal , non-tonal , intonational and accented -- use similar rising `` question intonation '' for yes -- no questions . This fact is a strong evidence of the universality of question intonation . In general , according to some authors , sentence intonation / pitch is pivotal in spoken grammar and is the basic information used by children to learn the grammar of whatever language .
