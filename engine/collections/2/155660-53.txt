They were only formally possessed by Spain for much of their colonial history , and were generally considered part of the `` Carolines '' ( present - day Federated State of Micronesia , Palau , and the US Territories of Marianas and Guam , as well as the Marshall Islands themselves ) , or alternatively the `` Nuevas Filipinas '' ( `` New Philippines '' ) . The islands were mostly left to their own affairs except for short - lived religious missions ( documented in 1668 and 1731 ) during the 16th and 17th centuries . They were largely ignored by European powers except for cartographic demarcation treaties between the Iberian Empires ( Portugal and Castilian Spain ) in 1529 , 1750 and 1777 . The archipelago corresponding to the present - day country was independently named by Krusenstern , after British explorer John Marshall , who visited them together with Thomas Gilbert in 1788 , en route from Botany Bay to Canton ( two ships of the First Fleet ) , and started establishing German and British trading posts , not formally contested by Spain .
