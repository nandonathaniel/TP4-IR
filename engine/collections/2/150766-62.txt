Voluntary Aided schools , linked to a variety of organisations . They can be faith schools ( about two thirds Church of England - affiliated ; just under one third Roman Catholic Church , and a few another faith ) , or non-denominational schools , such as those linked to London Livery Companies . The charitable foundation contributes towards the capital costs of the school ( typically 10 % ) , and appoints a majority of the school governors . The governing body employs the staff and has primary responsibility for admissions .
