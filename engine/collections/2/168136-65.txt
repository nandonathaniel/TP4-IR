One major issue with lever - actions ( and to a lesser extent pump - actions ) was that early shotgun shells were often made of paper or similar fragile materials ( modern hulls are plastic or metal ) . As a result , the loading of shells , or working of the action of the shotgun , could often result in cartridges getting crushed and becoming unusable , or even damaging the gun .
