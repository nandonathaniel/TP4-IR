Aztec religious life was organized around the calendars . As most Mesoamerican people , the Aztecs used two calendars simultaneously : a ritual calendar of 260 days called the tonalpohualli and a solar calendar of 365 days called the xiuhpohualli . Each day had a name and number in both calendars , and the combination of two dates were unique within a period of 52 years . The tonalpohualli was mostly used for divinatory purposes and it consisted of 20 day signs and number coefficients of 1 -- 13 that cycled in a fixed order . The xiuhpohualli was made up of 18 `` months '' of 20 days , and with a remainder of 5 `` void '' days at the end of a cycle before the new xiuhpohualli cycle began . Each 20 - day month was named after the specific ritual festival that began the month , many of which contained a relation to the agricultural cycle . Whether , and how , the Aztec calendar corrected for leap year is a matter of discussion among specialists . The monthly rituals involved the entire population as rituals were performed in each household , in the calpolli temples and in the main sacred precinct . Many festivals involved different forms of dancing , as well as the reenactment of mythical narratives by deity impersonators and the offering of sacrifice , in the form of food , animals and human victims .
