By late 1963 , some Fender amplifiers moved to blackface cosmetics . Other 1963 model amps -- particularly the Vibroverb ( the first Fender amp featuring internal reverb ) -- remained brown . The amps still spanned the spectrum from 4 watts to 85 , but the difference in volume was larger , due to the improved , clean tone of the 85w Twin .
