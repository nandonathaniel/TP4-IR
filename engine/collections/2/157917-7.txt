The concept and term `` magic '' developed in European society and thus using it when discussing non-Western cultures or pre-modern forms of Western society raises problems , as it may impose Western categories that are alien to them . While `` magic '' remains an emic term in the history of Western societies , it remains an etic term when applied to non-Western societies . During the twentieth century , many scholars focusing on Asian and African societies rejected the term `` magic '' , as well as related concepts like `` witchcraft '' , in favour of the more precise terms and concepts that existed within these specific societies . A similar approach has been taken by many scholars studying pre-modern societies in Europe , such as Classical antiquity , who find the modern concept of ' magic ' inappropriate and favour more specific terms originating within the framework of the ancient cultures which they are studying . Alternately , this term implies that all categories of magic are ethnocentric and that such Western preconceptions are an unavoidable component of scholarly research .
