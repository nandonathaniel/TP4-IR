The state hosts the Bengal tiger in Jim Corbett National Park , the oldest national park of the Indian subcontinent . The Valley of Flowers , a UNESCO World Heritage Site located in the upper expanses of Bhyundar Ganga near Joshimath in Gharwal region , is known for the variety and rarity of its flowers and plants . One who raised this was Sir Joseph Dalton Hooker , Director of the Royal Botanic Gardens , Kew , who visited the region . As a consequence , Lord Dalhousie issued the Indian Forest Charter in 1855 , reversing the previous laissez - faire policy . The following Indian Forest Act of 1878 put Indian forestry on a solid scientific basis . A direct consequence was the founding of the Imperial Forest School at Dehradun by Dietrich Brandis in 1878 . Renamed the ' Imperial Forest Research Institute ' in 1906 , it is now known as the Forest Research Institute ( India ) .
