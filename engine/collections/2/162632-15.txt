The settlement of Puerto Rico began with the establishment of the Ortoiroid culture from the Orinoco region in South America . Some scholars suggest that their settlement dates back 4000 years . An archeological dig at the island of Vieques in 1990 found the remains of what is believed to be an Ortoiroid man ( named Puerto Ferro man ) which was dated to around 2000 BC . The Ortoiroid were displaced by the Saladoid , a culture from the same region that arrived on the island between 430 and 250 BC .
