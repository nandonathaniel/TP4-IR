At the end of each U.S. Survivor season from Survivor : Africa onward , various Survivor props and memorabilia are auctioned online for charity . The most common recipient has been the Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation . Most recently , proceeds have gone toward The Serpentine Project , a charity founded by Jeff Probst , dedicated to helping those transitioning out of foster care upon emancipation at 18 years of age . Items up for auction have included flags , mats , tree mails , contestant torches , contestant clothing , autographed items , immunity idols and the voting urn .
