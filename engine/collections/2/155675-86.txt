The major impact of the Thirty Years ' War , in which mercenary armies were extensively used , was the devastation of entire regions scavenged bare by the foraging armies . Episodes of widespread famine and disease devastated the population of the German states and , to a lesser extent , the Low Countries and Italy , while bankrupting many of the powers involved . The war ended with the Treaty of MÃ¼nster , a part of the wider Peace of Westphalia .
