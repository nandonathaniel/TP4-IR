Salt Satyagraha produced scant progress toward dominion status or self - rule for India , and did not win any major concessions from the British . It also failed to attract Muslim support . Congress leaders decided to end satyagraha as official policy in 1934 . Nehru and other Congress members drifted further apart from Gandhi , who withdrew from Congress to concentrate on his Constructive Programme , which included his efforts to end untouchability in the Harijan movement . Even though British authorities were again in control by the mid-1930s , Indian , British , and world opinion increasingly began to recognise the legitimacy of claims by Gandhi and the Congress Party for sovereignty and self - rule . The Satyagraha campaign of the 1930s also forced the British to recognise that their control of India depended entirely on the consent of the Indians -- Salt Satyagraha was a significant step in the British losing that consent .
