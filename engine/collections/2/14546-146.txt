Prime Minister Golda Meir , Minister of Defense Moshe Dayan , and Chief of General Staff David Elazar met at 8 : 05 am the morning of Yom Kippur , six hours before the war began . Dayan opened the meeting by arguing that war was not a certainty . Elazar then presented his argument in favor of a pre-emptive attack against Syrian airfields at noon , Syrian missiles at 3 : 00 pm , and Syrian ground forces at 5 : 00 pm `` When the presentations were done , the prime minister hemmed uncertainly for a few moments but then came to a clear decision . There would be no preemptive strike . Israel might be needing American assistance soon and it was imperative that it would not be blamed for starting the war . ' If we strike first , we wo n't get help from anybody ' , she said . '' Prior to the war , Kissinger and Nixon consistently warned Meir that she must not be responsible for initiating a Middle east war . On October 6 , 1973 , the war opening date , Kissinger told Israel not to go for a preemptive strike , and Meir confirmed to him that Israel would not .
