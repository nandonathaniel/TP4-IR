In the 19th and 20th centuries numerous violins were produced in France , Saxony and the Mittenwald in what is now Germany , in the Tyrol , now parts of Austria and Italy , and in Bohemia , now part of the Czech Republic . About seven million violin family instruments and basses , and far more bows , were shipped from Markneukirchen between 1880 and 1914 . Many 19th and early 20th century instruments shipped from Saxony were in fact made in Bohemia , where the cost of living was less . While the French workshops in Mirecourt employed hundreds of workers , the Saxon / Bohemian instruments were made by a cottage industry of `` mostly anonymous skilled laborers quickly turning out a simple , inexpensive product .
