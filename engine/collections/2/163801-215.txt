The euro is the second-most widely held reserve currency after the U.S. dollar . After its introduction on 4 January 1999 its exchange rate against the other major currencies fell reaching its lowest exchange rates in 2000 ( 25 October vs the U.S. dollar , 26 October vs Japanese Yen , 3 May vs Pound Sterling ) . Afterwards it regained and its exchange rate reached its historical highest point in 2008 ( 15 July vs U.S. dollar , 23 July vs Japanese Yen , 29 December vs Pound Sterling ) . With the advent of the global financial crisis the euro initially fell , only to regain later . Despite pressure due to the European sovereign - debt crisis the euro remained stable . In November 2011 the euro 's exchange rate index -- measured against currencies of the bloc 's major trading partners -- was trading almost two percent higher on the year , approximately at the same level as it was before the crisis kicked off in 2007.In late August 2017 € rose again above 1.20 $. It also hit new relative or absolute highs against £ and other currencies .
