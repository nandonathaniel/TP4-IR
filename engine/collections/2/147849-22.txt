In 1971 , Thomas chose to end the series after five years . Both ABC and the show 's sponsor , Clairol , wanted the series finale to be a wedding between the two central characters , but Thomas rebuffed them , saying that she felt it was the wrong message to send to her female audience , because it would give the impression that the only happy ending is marriage . That Girl has since become popular in syndication .
