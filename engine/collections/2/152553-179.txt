Matt Zoller Seitz , in his positive review of the film , observed how `` ( i ) t 's less interested in a giant monster 's rampage than in what it might feel like to be a tiny human watching it close up , or far away , or on TV . It is not about Godzilla or the beasts he fights ... it 's a combination epic horror film and parable of nature in revolt , filled with odd ellipses and surprising but appropriate storytelling choices , such as an early monster duel that plays out mainly on CNN . '' In regards to the film 's shallow characters , `` the film is inclined to see them as representatives of an endangered species rather than complex individuals '' . He also noted in the film `` a touch of Terrence Malick 's Transcendentalist humility in how the director lavishes attention on meadows and forests and rolling waves '' , with the film 's final shot evoking The Thin Red Line ( 1998 ) .
