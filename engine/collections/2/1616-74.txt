The Lithobiomorpha , also known as stone centipedes , represent the other main group of anamorphic centipedes ; they also reach a mature segment count of 15 trunk segments . This group has lost the compound eyes , and sometimes has no eyes altogether . Instead , its eyes have a single ocellus or a group of ocelli . Its spiracles are paired and can be found laterally . Every leg - bearing segment of this organism has a separate tergite , these alternating in length apart from a pair of long tergites on each of segments 7 and 8 . It also has relatively short antennae and legs compared to the Scutigeromorpha . Two families are included , the Henicopidae and Lithobiidae .
