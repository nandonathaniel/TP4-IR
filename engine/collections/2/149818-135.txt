The revolution had attracted support from a broad coalition ranging from secular , left - wing nationalists to Islamists on the right , and Khomeini , who was now based in Paris after being expelled from Iraq , chose to present himself as a moderate able to bring together all the different factions leading the revolution . On 3 November a SAVAK plan to arrest about 1,500 people considered to be leaders of the revolution was submitted to Mohammad Reza , who at first tentatively agreed , but then changed his mind , disregarding not the only plan , but also dismissing its author , Parviz Sabeti . On 5 November 1978 , Mohammad Reza went on Iranian television to say `` I have heard the voice of your revolution '' and promise major reforms . In a major concession to the opposition , on 7 November 1978 , Mohammad Reza freed all political prisoners while ordering the arrest of the former prime minister Amir - Abbas Hoveyda and several senior officials of his regime , a move that both emboldened his opponents and demoralised his supporters . On 21 November 1978 , the Treasury Secretary of the United States Michael Blumenthal visited Tehran to meet Mohammad Reza and reported back to President Carter , `` This man is a ghost '' , as by now the ravages of his cancer could not longer be concealed . In late December 1978 , the Shah learned that many of his generals were making overtures to the revolutionary leaders and the loyalty of the military could not longer be counted upon . In a sign of desperation , the following month Mohammad Reza reached out to the National Front , asking if one of their leaders would be willing to become prime minister .
