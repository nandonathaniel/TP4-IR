The port of Santiago became the main target of naval operations . The U.S. fleet attacking Santiago needed shelter from the summer hurricane season , thus nearby Guantánamo Bay , with its excellent harbor , was chosen for this purpose and attacked on June 6 ( 1898 invasion of Guantánamo Bay ) . The Battle of Santiago de Cuba on July 3 , 1898 was the largest naval engagement during the Spanish -- American War , resulting in the destruction of the Spanish Caribbean Squadron ( Flota de Ultramar ) .
