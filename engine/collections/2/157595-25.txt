Unfortunately for Douvier , his first attempt at bombing Clouseau fails , and the subsequent attempt by Chinese martial artist ' Mr. Chong ' ( an uncredited appearance by the founder of American Kenpo , Ed Parker ) is thwarted when Clouseau successfully fights him off ( believing him to be Clouseau 's valet Cato ( Burt Kwouk ) , who has orders to keep his employer alert with random attacks ) . Douvier tries again by posing as an informant to lure Clouseau into a trap , but the Chief Inspector 's car and clothes are stolen by transvestite criminal Claude Russo ( Sue Lloyd ) , who is unknowingly killed by Douvier 's men instead . Subsequently , Douvier and the French public believe Clouseau is dead ; as a result of this assumption , Clouseau 's ex-boss , former Chief Inspector Charles Dreyfus ( Herbert Lom ) , is restored to sanity and is released from the lunatic asylum to perform the investigation ( despite being seemingly disintegrated in the previous film ) .
