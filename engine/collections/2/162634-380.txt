Emma Caulfield The Blind Witch is a witch who resides at her Gingerbread Home made completely out of candy deep in the woods . Her house and the treats lure in children , whom she would cook and eat . At some point , the Blind Witch comes to possess the Evil Queen 's poisoned apple . One day , the Evil Queen bargains with two young children , named Hansel and Gretel , to find their lost father , in return for stealing a poisoned apple from the witch . However , despite the Queen 's warning not to eat anything , Hansel licks some frosting off a cupcake , awaking the witch . She tries to eat Hansel and Gretel but they trick her and lock her in her own oven . The Queen , who was watching the events through her mirror , sends a bolt of fire through the mirror and lights the oven on fire . Since her death , the Blind Witch works at the Underworld 's version of Granny 's Diner when she encounters Mary Margaret . She has n't forgiven Regina for sending Hansel and Gretel to retrieve the apple and for burning her alive . Mary Margaret gets the Blind Witch to tell them where they can find Hercules . She tips them off by stating that he comes in from the shipyards during his lunch hour . The Blind Witch later informs Emma , Regina , and Red about where they can find Auntie Em stating that where she works is the competition to her business . She later acquired powers from Hades to keep the outsiders from escaping the Underworld in exchange for taking over the realm with Cruella when Hades leaves , this after Regina discovered that she was n't supposed to have any ability to obtain magic . After the heroes escape the Underworld , she continues her work in the Underbrooke diner at the time when King Arthur arrived after he was killed by Hades .
