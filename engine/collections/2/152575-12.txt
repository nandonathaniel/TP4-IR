Springfield 's Kwik - E-Mart is operated by an Indian American named Apu Nahasapeemapetilon , who mans the store with his brother Sanjay and is a caricature of the stereotypical `` foreign born '' convenience store clerk . Apu is an extremely devoted convenience store clerk / owner , rarely closing his store and occasionally working 96 - hour shifts . Apu proudly gouges customers and sells tainted merchandise , such as rotten meat or expired milk . Springfield 's Kwik - E-Mart is quite often the target of robbers , leading to Apu having been shot on several occasions . It is a favorite target of local criminal Snake Jailbird , who has held up the Kwik - E-Mart several times .
