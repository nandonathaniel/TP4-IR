Writing about the war in Foreign Affairs magazine Zulfikar Ali Bhutto stated `` There is no parallel in contemporary history to the cataclysm which engulfed Pakistan in 1971 . A tragic civil war , which rent asunder the people of the two parts of Pakistan , was seized by India as an opportunity for armed intervention . The country was dismembered , its economy shattered and the nation 's self - confidence totally undermined . '' This statement of Bhutto has given rise to the myth of betrayal prevalent in modern Pakistan . This view was contradicted by the post-War Hamoodur Rahman Commission , ordered by Bhutto himself , which in its 1974 report indicted generals of the Pakistan Army for creating conditions which led to the eventual loss of East Pakistan and for inept handling of military operations in the East .
