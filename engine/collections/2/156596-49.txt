Adam West as Bruce Wayne / Batman : A millionaire whose parents were murdered by criminals , he now secretly uses his vast fortune to fight crime as Batman . Producer William Dozier cast Adam West in the role after seeing him perform as the James Bond - like spy Captain Q in a Nestl√© Quik television ad . Lyle Waggoner had screen - tested for the role , though West ultimately won out because , it was said , he was the only person who could deliver the hilarious lines with a straight face . West later voiced an animated version of the title character on The New Adventures of Batman and well as Super Friends : The Legendary Super Powers Show and The Super Powers Team : Galactic Guardians .
