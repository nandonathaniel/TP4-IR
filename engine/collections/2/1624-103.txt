Comparison of EEG bands Band Frequency ( Hz ) Location Normally Pathologically Delta < 4 frontally in adults , posteriorly in children ; high - amplitude waves adult slow - wave sleep in babies Has been found during some continuous - attention tasks subcortical lesions diffuse lesions metabolic encephalopathy hydrocephalus deep midline lesions Theta 4 -- 7 Found in locations not related to task at hand higher in young children drowsiness in adults and teens idling Associated with inhibition of elicited responses ( has been found to spike in situations where a person is actively trying to repress a response or action ) . focal subcortical lesions metabolic encephalopathy deep midline disorders some instances of hydrocephalus Alpha 8 -- 15 posterior regions of head , both sides , higher in amplitude on dominant side . Central sites ( c3 - c4 ) at rest relaxed / reflecting closing the eyes Also associated with inhibition control , seemingly with the purpose of timing inhibitory activity in different locations across the brain . coma Beta 16 -- 31 both sides , symmetrical distribution , most evident frontally ; low - amplitude waves range span : active calm → intense → stressed → mild obsessive active thinking , focus , high alert , anxious benzodiazepines Dup15q syndrome Gamma > 32 Somatosensory cortex Displays during cross-modal sensory processing ( perception that combines two different senses , such as sound and sight ) Also is shown during short - term memory matching of recognized objects , sounds , or tactile sensations A decrease in gamma - band activity may be associated with cognitive decline , especially when related to the theta band ; however , this has not been proven for use as a clinical diagnostic measurement Mu 8 -- 12 Sensorimotor cortex Shows rest - state motor neurons . Mu suppression could indicate that motor mirror neurons are working . Deficits in Mu suppression , and thus in mirror neurons , might play a role in autism .
