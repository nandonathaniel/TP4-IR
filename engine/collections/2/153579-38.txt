The system of DNA profiling used today is based on PCR and uses simple sequences or short tandem repeats ( STR ) . This method uses highly polymorphic regions that have short repeated sequences of DNA ( the most common is 4 bases repeated , but there are other lengths in use , including 3 and 5 bases ) . Because unrelated people almost certainly have different numbers of repeat units , STRs can be used to discriminate between unrelated individuals . These STR loci ( locations on a chromosome ) are targeted with sequence - specific primers and amplified using PCR . The DNA fragments that result are then separated and detected using electrophoresis . There are two common methods of separation and detection , capillary electrophoresis ( CE ) and gel electrophoresis .
