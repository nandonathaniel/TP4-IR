The Working Khaki uniform was worn by Officers and Chief Petty Officers , primarily aboard ship or in selected working areas at bases ashore . Originally it was simply the Service Dress Khaki uniform worn without the coat and tie . Similar to , but less formal than , the Service Khaki , it consisted of a short or long - sleeve khaki uniform shirt , with warfare insignia and badges ( i.e. command pins , nametags , etc. , but no ribbons ) worn on the top of the left pocket , and pin - on metal rank devices located on the collar . It also came with a set of khaki trousers , a khaki belt with a gold belt buckle , a command or `` U.S. Navy '' ballcap ( garrison cap optional ) , and black or brown low quarter shoes , black or brown boots , or black leather safety shoes . It was often referred to as the `` Wash Khaki '' uniform , because it was a 100 % cotton uniform that could be laundered but required pressing , differentiating it from the Summer Khaki made of Certified Navy Twill ( CNT ) or a poly - wool blend that is considered acceptable for wear ashore and off base , but which requires dry - cleaning . At the beginning of January 2011 , the working khakis were replaced by the Navy Working Uniform , although the Navy Junior ROTC still uses them .
