The Presidents ' Trophy winner is guaranteed home - ice advantage in all four rounds of the Stanley Cup playoffs , provided the team advances that far . However , it does not guarantee that success , as only eight of all the Presidents ' Trophy winners have gone on to win the Stanley Cup in their respective years , leading to a popular superstition that the Trophy may be cursed . In addition , six Presidents ' Trophy winners have been eliminated in the preliminary round of the playoffs , with first - round upsets being common in the NHL compared to other major professional sports .
