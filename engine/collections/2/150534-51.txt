Million Ants ( voiced by Tom Kenny ) -- A sentient ant colony who was brought to life by ( and later had an affair with ) Supernova . He is virtually invincible as long as his queen ant is unharmed , because if he loses any ants , they can simply be replaced by laying more eggs . He is killed by Supernova when she crushes the queen after he tries to stop her from killing Rick and Morty . He is likely a parody of Ant - Man , though he bears more of a resemblance to the Marvel villain Swarm , and DC comics superhero ( formerly villainous ) Clayface .
