Unsafe at Any Speed by Ralph Nader , published in 1965 , is a pioneering book accusing car manufacturers of being slow to introduce safety features , and reluctant to spend money on improving safety . The subject for which the book is probably most widely known , the rear - engined GM Chevrolet Corvair , is covered in the first chapter . It relates to the first ( 1960 -- 1964 ) models that had a swing - axle suspension design which was prone to `` tuck under '' in certain circumstances . In substitution for the cost - cutting lack of a front stabilizer bar ( anti-roll bar ) , Corvairs required tire pressures which were outside of the tire manufacturer 's recommended tolerances . The Corvair relied on an unusually high front to rear pressure differential ( 15psi front , 26psi rear , when cold ; 18 psi and 30psi hot ) , and if one inflated the tires equally , as was standard practice for all other cars at the time , the result was a dangerous oversteer .
