The park is named after an Ojibwe legend of the sleeping bear . According to the legend , an enormous forest fire on the western shore of Lake Michigan drove a mother bear and her two cubs into the lake for shelter , determined to reach the opposite shore . After many miles of swimming , the two cubs lagged behind . When the mother bear reached the shore , she waited on the top of a high bluff . The exhausted cubs drowned in the lake , but the mother bear stayed and waited in hopes that her cubs would finally appear . Impressed by the mother bear 's determination and faith , the Great Spirit created two islands ( North and South Manitou islands ) to commemorate the cubs , and the winds buried the sleeping bear under the sands of the dunes where she waits to this day . The `` bear '' was a small tree - covered knoll at the top edge of the bluff that , from the water , had the appearance of a sleeping bear . Wind and erosion have caused the `` bear '' to be greatly reduced in size over the years .
