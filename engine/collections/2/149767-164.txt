Joseph LoDuca , a frequent Sam Raimi collaborator who composed the scores for the Evil Dead films , contributes the original music for Ash vs Evil Dead . The series also leverages excerpts from various 1970s and ' 80s popular songs , particularly featuring artists ( e.g. , Alice Cooper , Ted Nugent and Frijid Pink ) from the greater Detroit area where Season One 's action is based ( and where Raimi , Campbell and Tapert grew up ) . In an interview , Sam Raimi states that the music selected for the series is based on the lack of growth the Ash character has progressed over the past 30 -- 35 years , and that , `` the music should reflect the last time he was engaged in society , and living '' .
