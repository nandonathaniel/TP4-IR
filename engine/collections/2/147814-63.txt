In the Song dynasty ( 960 -- 1279 ) more than a hundred higher level examinations were held . Officials selected through the exams became dominant in the bureaucracy . Theoretically , the examinations were open to adult ( at least in terms of literacy ) Chinese males , with some restrictions . This included even individuals from the occupied northern territories . Many individuals moved from a low social status to political prominence through success in imperial examination . Examples include Wang Anshi , who proposed reforms to make the exams more practical , and Zhu Xi , whose interpretations of the Four Classics became the orthodox Neo-Confucianism which dominated later dynasties . Two other prominent successful entries into politics through the examination system were Su Shi and his brother Su Zhe : both of whom became political opponents of Wang Anshi . Indeed , one of the major objectives of the examination system was to promote diversity of viewpoints and to avoid over-filling of offices with individuals of particular political or partisan alignment , as might occur with alternative , more biased methods , which could allow for active recruitment . Yet the process of studying for the examination tended to be time - consuming and costly , requiring time to spare and tutors . Most of the candidates came from the numerically small but relatively wealthy land - owning scholar - official class .
