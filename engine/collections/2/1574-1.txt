The Hebrew Bible states that the temple was constructed under Solomon , king of the United Kingdom of Israel and Judah and that during the Kingdom of Judah , the temple was dedicated to Yahweh , and is said to have housed the Ark of the Covenant . Jewish historian Josephus says that `` the temple was burnt four hundred and seventy years , six months , and ten days after it was built '' , although rabbinic sources state that the First Temple stood for 410 years and , based on the 2nd - century work Seder Olam Rabbah , place construction in 832 BCE and destruction in 422 BCE , 165 years later than secular estimates .
