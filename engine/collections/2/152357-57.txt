Production of Sense and Sensibility was scheduled for fifty - eight days , though this was eventually extended to sixty - five . Filming commenced in mid-April 1995 at a number of locations in Devon , beginning with Saltram House ( standing in for Norland Park ) , where Winslet and Jones shot the first scene of the production : when their characters read about Barton Cottage . As Saltram was a National Trust property , Schamus had to sign a contract before production began , and staff with the organisation remained on set to carefully monitor the filming . Production later returned to shoot several more scenes , finishing there on 29 April . The second location of filming , Flete House , stood in for part of Mrs. Jennings ' London estate , where Edward first sees Elinor with Lucy . Representing Barton Cottage was a Flete Estate stone cottage , which Thompson called `` one of the most beautiful spots we 've ever seen . ''
