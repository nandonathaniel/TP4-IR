From the 21st Dynasty onward , more copies of the Book of the Dead are found in hieratic script . The calligraphy is similar to that of other hieratic manuscripts of the New Kingdom ; the text is written in horizontal lines across wide columns ( often the column size corresponds to the size of the papyrus sheets of which a scroll is made up ) . Occasionally a hieratic Book of the Dead contains captions in hieroglyphic .
