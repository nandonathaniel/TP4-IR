Early was similarly unprepared when he ordered Harry T. Hays ' and Isaac E. Avery 's Brigades to attack the Union XI Corps positions on East Cemetery Hill . Once started , fighting was fierce : Col. Andrew L. Harris of the Union 2nd Brigade , 1st Division , came under a withering attack , losing half his men . Avery was wounded early on , but the Confederates reached the crest of the hill and entered the Union breastworks , capturing one or two batteries . Seeing he was not supported on his right , Hays withdrew . His right was to be supported by Robert E. Rodes ' Division , but Rodes -- like Early and Johnson -- had not been ordered up in preparation for the attack . He had twice as far to travel as Early ; by the time he came in contact with the Union skirmish line , Early 's troops had already begun to withdraw .
