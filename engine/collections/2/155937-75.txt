Since the deaths of Senna and Ratzenberger , the FIA has used safety as a reason to impose rule changes that otherwise , under the Concorde Agreement , would have had to be agreed upon by all the teams -- most notably the changes introduced for 1998 . This so - called ' narrow track ' era resulted in cars with smaller rear tyres , a narrower track overall , and the introduction of grooved tyres to reduce mechanical grip . There were to be four grooves on the front ( three in the first year ) and rear that ran through the entire circumference of the tyre . The objective was to reduce cornering speeds and to produce racing similar to rainy conditions by enforcing a smaller contact patch between tyre and track . This , according to the FIA , was to promote driver skill and provide a better spectacle .
