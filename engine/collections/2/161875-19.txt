Certain derecho situations are the most common instances of severe weather outbreaks which may become less favorable to tornado production as they become more violent ; the height of 30 -- 31 May 1998 upper Middle West - Canada - New York State derecho and the latter stages of significant tornado and severe weather outbreaks in 2003 and 2004 are only three examples of this . Some upper - air measurements used for severe - weather forecasting may reflect this point of diminishing return for tornado formation , and the mentioned three situations were instances during which the rare Particularly Dangerous Situation severe thunderstorm variety of severe weather watches were issued from the Storm Prediction Center of the U.S. National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration .
