In 2015 , experimental studies reported the detection of significant episodic ( situational ) cognitive impairment from impurities in indoor air breathed by test subjects who were not informed about changes in the air quality . Researchers at the Harvard University and SUNY Upstate Medical University and Syracuse University measured the cognitive performance of 24 participants in three different controlled laboratory atmospheres that simulated those found in `` conventional '' and `` green '' buildings , as well as green buildings with enhanced ventilation . Performance was evaluated objectively using the widely used Strategic Management Simulation software simulation tool , which is a well - validated assessment test for executive decision - making in an unconstrained situation allowing initiative and improvisation . Significant deficits were observed in the performance scores achieved in increasing concentrations of either volatile organic compounds ( VOCs ) or carbon dioxide , while keeping other factors constant . The highest impurity levels reached are not uncommon in some classroom or office environments .
