The alcohol laws of Kentucky , which govern the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages in that state , lead to a confusing patchwork of counties that are dry , prohibiting all sale of alcoholic beverages ; wet , permitting full retail sales under state license ; and `` moist '' , occupying a middle ground between the two . A justice of the Kentucky Supreme Court wrote in 1985 that the state 's alcohol laws were a `` maze of obscure statutory language '' and `` confusing at best . '' The general counsel of the Kentucky Office of Alcoholic Beverage Control ( ABC ) noted in 2012 , `` That 's still the case . '' This led Kentucky governor Steve Beshear to appoint a task force in summer 2012 to attempt to streamline the state 's alcohol laws .
