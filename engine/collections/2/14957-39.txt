When the ancient Egyptian pharaoh Akhenaten uses a source of cosmic power , the Heart of the Universe , to seize power in present - day Earth ( killing most of Earth 's heroes in the process ) , Thanos uses a time - travel stratagem to defeat him . Thanos then uses the Heart of the Universe to reverse Akhenaten 's actions and was also compelled to correct a flaw in the universe , for which Mistress Death kisses him , and speaks to him for the first time . Changed by the experience , Thanos advises confidant Adam Warlock he will no longer seek universal conquest .
