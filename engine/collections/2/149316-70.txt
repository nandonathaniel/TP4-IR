When an insert is made such that the number of entries in a hash table exceeds the product of the load factor and the current capacity then the hash table will need to be rehashed . Rehashing includes increasing the size of the underlying data structure and mapping existing items to new bucket locations . In some implementations , if the initial capacity is greater than the maximum number of entries divided by the load factor , no rehash operations will ever occur .
