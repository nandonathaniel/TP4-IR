Schumer was one of the Gang of Eight , a bipartisan group of four Democratic and four Republican senators who wrote and sponsored a 2013 comprehensive immigration reform bill . At the time , Schumer was the chairman of the Immigration , Refugees , and Border Security subcommittee of the Senate Judiciary Committee . In June 2013 , the immigration bill passed the Senate with a strong majority -- 68 - 32 , with 14 Republicans joining all Democrats -- but the House of Representatives under Speaker John Boehner refused to take up the bill , and the legislation died .
