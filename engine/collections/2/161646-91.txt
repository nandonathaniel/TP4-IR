Spanish syntax is considered right - branching , meaning that subordinate or modifying constituents tend to be placed after their head words . The language uses prepositions ( rather than postpositions or inflection of nouns for case ) , and usually -- though not always -- places adjectives after nouns , as do most other Romance languages .
