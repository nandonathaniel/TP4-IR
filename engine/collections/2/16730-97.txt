After the 2011 relaunch , Diana gained new powers . These new abilities , which included superhuman speed , durability , longevity , accelerated healing , and even flight came in addition to her previous attributed Olympian strength . She is now considered to be stronger than Hercules . In addition to her weaponry , Diana 's indestructible bracelets can now create an thunderous explosion when she clashes them together . These new abilities are attributed to being the daughter of Hippolyta and Zeus . Her powers are now considered nearly unmeasurable if she goes without her Bracelets of Submission , which keep her powers in check . She uses these powers in battle against the goddess Artemis and quickly renders her unconscious with ease with a series of carefully positioned counterattacks . While using her godly strength , her outfit and accoutrements lit up and her eyes glowed like her father 's .
