Based loosely on the Officer Candidate School ( OCS ) , NCOC was a new concept ( at the time ) where high performing trainees attending basic infantry combat training were nominated to attend a two - phased course of focused instruction on jungle warfare , and included a hands - on portion of intense training , promotion to sergeant , and then a 12 - week assignment leading trainees going through advanced training .
