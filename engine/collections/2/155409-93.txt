The transmission gratings , which swing into the optical path behind the mirrors , provide Chandra with high resolution spectroscopy . The High Energy Transmission Grating Spectrometer ( HETGS ) works over 0.4 -- 10 keV and has a spectral resolution of 60 -- 1000 . The Low Energy Transmission Grating Spectrometer ( LETGS ) has a range of 0.09 -- 3 keV and a resolution of 40 -- 2000 .
