While large body parts are the same from 53 - 56 F - 100 & F250 's ( namely the hood , fenders , and all bed components ) in 1956 Ford did a redesign of the cab , changing the shape of the windshield , doors and door openings , and also offering a rear panoramic `` Big Back Window '' option . This makes the 1956 F series trucks into a one year only truck .
