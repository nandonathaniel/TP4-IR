The recognized founder of empiricism was John Locke who proposed in An Essay Concerning Human Understanding ( 1689 ) that the only true knowledge that could be accessible to the human mind was that which was based on experience . He argued that the human mind was created as a tabula rasa , a `` blank tablet , '' upon which sensory impressions were recorded and built up knowledge through a process of reflection .
