Historically , El Niño events are thought to have been occurring for thousands of years . For example , it is thought that El Niño affected the Inca Empire in modern - day Peru , who sacrificed humans in order to try to prevent the rains . Scientists have also found the chemical signatures of warmer sea surface temperatures and increased rainfall caused by El Niño in coral specimens that are around 13,000 years old . In around 1525 when Francisco Pizarro made landfall on Peru , he noted rainfall occurring in the deserts which subsequently became the first written record of the impacts of El Niño . Modern day research and reanalysis techniques have managed to find at least 26 El Niño events since 1900 , with the 1982 - 83 , 1997 -- 98 and 2014 -- 16 events among the strongest on record .
