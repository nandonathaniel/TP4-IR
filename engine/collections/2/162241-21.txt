Coughing fits can occur on their own or can be triggered by yawning , stretching , laughing , eating , or yelling ; they usually occur in groups , with multiple episodes on an hourly basis throughout the day . This stage usually lasts two to eight weeks , or sometimes longer . A gradual transition then occurs to the convalescent stage , which usually lasts one to four weeks . This stage is marked by a decrease in paroxysms of coughing , both in frequency and severity , and a cessation of vomiting . A tendency to produce the `` whooping '' sound after coughing may remain for a considerable period after the disease itself has cleared up .
