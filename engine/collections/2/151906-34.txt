The segmented DAC , which combines the thermometer - coded principle for the most significant bits and the binary - weighted principle for the least significant bits . In this way , a compromise is obtained between precision ( by the use of the thermometer - coded principle ) and number of resistors or current sources ( by the use of the binary - weighted principle ) . The full binary - weighted design means 0 % segmentation , the full thermometer - coded design means 100 % segmentation .
