The Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) `` battled Michigan 's Department of Environmental Quality behind the scenes for at least six months over whether Flint needed to use chemical treatments to keep lead lines and plumbing connections from leaching into drinking water '' and `` did not publicize its concern that Flint residents ' health was jeopardized by the state 's insistence that such controls were not required by law '' . In 2015 , EPA water expert Miguel A. Del Toral `` identified potential problems with Flint 's drinking water in February , confirmed the suspicions in April and summarized the looming problem '' in an internal memo circulated on June 24 , 2015 .
