A parlay , accumulator , or combo bet is a single bet that links together two or more individual wagers and is dependent on all of those wagers winning together . The benefit of the parlay is that there are much higher payoffs than placing each individual bet separately , since the difficulty of hitting all of them is much higher . If any of the bets in the parlay lose , the entire parlay loses . If any of the plays in the parlay ties , or `` pushes '' , the parlay reverts to a lower number of teams with the odds reducing accordingly .
