In tetrapodomorph fishes such as Eusthenopteron , the part of the body that would later become the neck was covered by a number of gill - covering bones known as the opercular series . These bones functioned as part of pump mechanism for forcing water through the mouth and past the gills . When the mouth opened to take in water , the gill flaps closed ( including the gill - covering bones ) , thus ensuring that water entered only through the mouth . When the mouth closed , the gill flaps opened and water was forced through the gills . In Acanthostega , a basal tetrapod , the gill - covering bones have disappeared , although the underlying gill arches are still present . Besides the opercular series , Acanthostega also lost the throat - covering bones ( gular series ) . The opercular series and gular series combined are sometimes known as the operculo - gular or operculogular series . Other bones in the neck region lost in Acanthostega ( and later tetrapods ) include the extrascapular series and the supracleithral series . Both sets of bones connect the shoulder girdle to the skull . With the loss of these bones , tetrapods acquired a neck , allowing the head to rotate somewhat independently of the torso . This , in turn , required stronger soft - tissue connections between head and torso , including muscles and ligaments connecting the skull with the spine and shoulder girdle . Bones and groups of bones were also consolidated and strengthened .
