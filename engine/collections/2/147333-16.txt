Further studies on the cholinergic system and AD demonstrated acetylcholine plays a role in learning and memory . Scopolamine , an anticholinergic drug , was used to block cholinergic activity in young adults and induce memory impairments similar to those present in the elderly . The memory impairments were reversed when treated with physostigmine , a cholinergic agonist . However , reversing memory impairments in AD patients may not be this easy due to permanent changes in brain structure .
