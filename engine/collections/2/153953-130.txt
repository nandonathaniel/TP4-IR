In Roman Catholicism , all marriages more distant than first - cousin marriages are allowed , and first - cousin marriages can be contracted with a dispensation . This was not always the case , however : the Catholic Church has gone through several phases in kinship prohibitions . At the dawn of Christianity in Roman times , marriages between first cousins were allowed . For example , Emperor Constantine , the first Christian Roman Emperor , married his children to the children of his half - brother . First and second cousin marriages were then banned at the Council of Agde in AD 506 , though dispensations sometimes continued to be granted . By the 11th century , with the adoption of the so - called canon - law method of computing consanguinity , these proscriptions had been extended even to sixth cousins , including by marriage . But due to the many resulting difficulties in reckoning who was related to whom , they were relaxed back to third cousins at the Fourth Lateran Council in AD 1215 . Pope Benedict XV reduced this to second cousins in 1917 , and finally , the current law was enacted in 1983 . In Catholicism , close relatives who have married unwittingly without a dispensation can receive an annulment .
