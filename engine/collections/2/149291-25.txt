The Internet protocol suite provides end - to - end data communication specifying how data should be packetized , addressed , transmitted , routed , and received . This functionality is organized into four abstraction layers which classify all related protocols according to the scope of networking involved . From lowest to highest , the layers are the link layer , containing communication methods for data that remains within a single network segment ( link ) ; the internet layer , providing internetworking between independent networks ; the transport layer handling host - to - host communication ; and the application layer , which provides process - to - process data exchange for applications .
