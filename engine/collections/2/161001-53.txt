Siamese Dream was released on July 27 , 1993 and debuted at number ten on the Billboard 200 the following week . The album was almost universally lauded by music critics . Select 's Andrew Perry praised it as `` the most grand - scale , expansively - passionate blasts of music you 'll hear this year '' and remarked that it would be `` hard for anyone to top this one '' . John Harris of NME wrote that Siamese Dream , `` for all its air of non-committal blankness and exercise - book psychoanalysis , is a startling , deeply satisfying record '' . Steve Hochman of the Los Angeles Times predicted that `` the scale of its success will likely be tied to how many fans are willing to stop moshing and enter into some rather contemplative , even tender territory '' , and wrote that `` the songs tend to drift in places , and some get a bit long - winded , but the overall balance between the harsh and the sweet makes for a strong and distinctive package '' . Lorraine Ali of Rolling Stone called the album `` a strong , multidimensional extension of Gish that confirms that Smashing Pumpkins are neither sellouts nor one - offs . ''
