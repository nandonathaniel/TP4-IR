Visual effects producers were hired to begin work on the series during the initial writing period , with Fuller explaining that the series would require such things as `` digital augmentation on certain alien species '' and `` the transporter beams '' . He said , `` We 're trying to cultivate distinct looks for all of those things that are unique to our version of Star Trek and carry through the themes we love seeing in fifty years of Star Trek , but doing a slightly different approach . '' Pixomondo is the primary visual effects vendor for the series , with Spin VFX and Crafty Apes also working on the show . Kurtzman noted that the series utilizes multiple CG environments which take several months to properly render . The shuttle bay of the Discovery is completely computer - generated , with actors performing in front of a green screen for scenes in that environment ; using the digital set is more expensive than any other set created for the series , including the practically - built ones .
