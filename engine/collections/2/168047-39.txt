Other materials have been tried with varying degrees of success , such as the 1950s Grafton plastic alto saxophone and its recent successor , the polycarbonate saxophone , Vibratosax . There is also the wooden Sawat saxophone created in Thailand on a small scale . Recent years have seen the use of higher copper alloys substituted for the `` yellow brass '' or `` cartridge brass '' that are most common , for visual and tonal effect . Yanagisawa 's 902 and 992 series saxophones are made with phosphor bronze , which is claimed to offer slightly different , more `` vintage '' tonal qualities from the brass 901 and 991 models of identical design . Other saxophones made of high copper alloys are sold under the brands Chateau , Kessler , Saxgourmet , and Bauhaus Walstein . Yanagisawa and other manufacturers , starting with the King Super 20 around 1950 , have made saxophone necks , bells , or entire instruments from sterling silver . Keilwerth and P. Mauriat have made saxes with a nickel silver body . Opinions vary on the significance of body materials to sound . With the exception of the identical brass and phosphor bronze Yanagisawa models , opportunities to isolate body materials from other variables in design and construction are lacking .
