In the secondary market , securities are sold by and transferred from one investor or speculator to another . It is therefore important that the secondary market be highly liquid ( originally , the only way to create this liquidity was for investors and speculators to meet at a fixed place regularly ; this is how stock exchanges originated , see History of the Stock Exchange ) . As a general rule , the greater the number of investors that participate in a given marketplace , and the greater the centralization of that marketplace , the more liquid the market .
