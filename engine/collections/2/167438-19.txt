Gerry Conway and Roy Thomas succeeded Stan Lee as writer and editor , respectively , of The Amazing Spider - Man . Together with inker John Romita , Sr. , they came to the decision to have Gwen Stacy killed off . It was Romita who first suggested the idea , during a plotting session with Conway when Romita was still penciller on The Amazing Spider - Man . Conway later said his contribution to the decision was motivated by a desire to bring Mary Jane Watson to the forefront , as he shared Lee 's feeling that she was a more interesting character than Gwen Stacy : `` ( Mary Jane ) had n't lost the edge that made her an interesting character . Gwen did n't have an edge . She was just a nice person . ''
