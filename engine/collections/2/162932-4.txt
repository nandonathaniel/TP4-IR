The mathematical description of stock market movements has been a subject of intense interest . The conventional assumption has been that stock markets behave according to a random log - normal distribution . Among others , mathematician Beno√Æt Mandelbrot suggested as early as 1963 that the statistics prove this assumption incorrect . Mandelbrot observed that large movements in prices ( i.e. crashes ) are much more common than would be predicted from a log - normal distribution . Mandelbrot and others suggested that the nature of market moves is generally much better explained using non-linear analysis and concepts of chaos theory . This has been expressed in non-mathematical terms by George Soros in his discussions of what he calls reflexivity of markets and their non-linear movement . George Soros said in late October 1987 , ' Mr. Robert Prechter 's reversal proved to be the crack that started the avalanche ' .
