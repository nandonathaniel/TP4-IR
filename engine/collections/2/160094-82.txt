The Big Five personality traits have been assessed in some non-human species but methodology is debatable . In one series of studies , human ratings of chimpanzees using the Hominoid Personality Questionnaire , revealed factors of extraversion , conscientiousness and agreeableness -- as well as an additional factor of dominance -- across hundreds of chimpanzees in zoological parks , a large naturalistic sanctuary , and a research laboratory . Neuroticism and openness factors were found in an original zoo sample , but were not replicated in a new zoo sample or in other settings ( perhaps reflecting the design of the CPQ ) . A study review found that markers for the three dimensions extraversion , neuroticism , and agreeableness were found most consistently across different species , followed by openness ; only chimpanzees showed markers for conscientious behavior .
