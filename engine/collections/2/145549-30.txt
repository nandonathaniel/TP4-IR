Pinkner and Wyman revealed in a conference call interview that the episode was the `` culmination of a lot of things that ( they ) had been working on for quite a while '' . Though they loved all of their episodes , the two stated that `` Entrada '' was a particular favorite of theirs , with Pinker elaborating that `` if the only episode of Fringe you ever tune into watch is this one , sure , it 's going to take you five minutes to catch up , but you will feel what 's going on , and you will understand the relationships ... ( It 's ) a great entry point '' . The producers considered making `` Entrada '' the mid-season finale , but instead selected `` Marionette '' , the following week 's episode .
