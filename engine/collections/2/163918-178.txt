From this time , there was a growing acceptance of the position of Prime Minister and the title was more commonly used , if only unofficially . Associated initially with the Whigs , the Tories started to accept it . Lord North , for example , who had said the office was `` unknown to the constitution '' , reversed himself in 1783 when he said , `` In this country some one man or some body of men like a Cabinet should govern the whole and direct every measure . '' In 1803 , William Pitt the Younger , also a Tory , suggested to a friend that `` this person generally called the first minister '' was an absolute necessity for a government to function , and expressed his belief that this person should be the minister in charge of the finances .
