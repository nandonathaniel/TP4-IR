I was trying to keep it close to the vest throughout the release . Paul Walker used to say that ( an eighth film ) was guaranteed . And in some ways , when your brother guarantees something , you sometimes feel like you have to make sure it comes to pass ... so if fate has it , then you 'll get this when you hear about it . ( Furious 7 ) was for Paul , ( the eighth film ) is from Paul .
