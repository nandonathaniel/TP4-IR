In 1825 , a faction of the Griqua people was induced by Dr John Philip , superintendent of the London Missionary Society in Southern Africa , to relocate to a place called Philippolis , a mission station for the San , several hundred miles southeast of Griqualand . Philip 's intention was for the Griquas to protect the missionary station there against banditti in the region , and as a bulwark against the northward movement of white settlers from the Cape Colony . Friction between the Griquas and the settlers over land rights resulted in British troops being sent to the region in 1845 . It marked the beginning of nine years of British intervention in the affairs of the region , which the British named Transorange .
