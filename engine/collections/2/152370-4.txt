Consider a block that is to be lifted by a wedge . As the wedge slides under the block , the block slides up the sloped side of a wedge . This lifts the weight F of the block . The horizontal force F needed to lift the block is obtained by considering the velocity of the wedge v and the velocity of the block v. If we assume the wedge does not dissipate or store energy , then the power into the wedge equals the power out .
