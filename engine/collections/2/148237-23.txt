The Stooge films made between 1935 and 1941 captured the team at their peak , according to film historians Ted Okuda and Edward Watz , authors of The Columbia Comedy Shorts . Nearly every film produced became a classic in its own right . Hoi Polloi ( 1935 ) adapted the premise of Pygmalion , with a stuffy professor making a bet that he can transform the uncultured trio into refined gentlemen ; the plotline worked so well that it was reused twice , as Half - Wits Holiday ( 1947 ) and Pies and Guys ( 1958 ) . Three Little Beers ( 1935 ) featured the Stooges running amok on a golf course to win prize money . Disorder in the Court ( 1936 ) features the team as star witnesses in a murder trial . Violent is the Word for Curly ( 1938 ) was a quality Chase - directed short that featured the musical interlude `` Swingin ' the Alphabet '' . In A Plumbing We Will Go ( 1940 ) -- one of the team 's quintessential comedies -- the Stooges are cast as plumbers who nearly destroy a socialite 's mansion , causing water to exit every appliance in the home . Other entries of the era are considered among the team 's finest work , including Uncivil Warriors ( 1935 ) , A Pain in the Pullman and False Alarms ( both 1936 ) , Grips , Grunts and Groans , The Sitter Downers , Dizzy Doctors ( all 1937 ) , Tassels in the Air ( 1938 ) , We Want Our Mummy ( 1939 ) , Nutty but Nice ( 1940 ) , and An Ache in Every Stake and In the Sweet Pie and Pie ( both 1941 ) .
