In the great song of praise to God for his triumph over the Whore of Babylon in chapter 19 of the New Testament book of Revelation , the Greek word ἀλληλούϊα ( allēluia ) , a transliteration of the same Hebrew word , appears four times , as an expression of praise rather than an exhortation to praise . In English translations this is mostly rendered as `` Hallelujah '' , but as `` Alleluia '' in several translations , while a few have `` Praise the Lord '' , `` Praise God '' , `` Praise our God '' , or `` Thanks to our God '' .
