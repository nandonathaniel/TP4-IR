With the effects of the late - 2000s recession reducing breakfast traffic to the stores , Burger King announced that it was making the first wholesale changes to its breakfast line - up in many years . In early 2010 , Burger King tested a new group of breakfast products under its new BK Brunch product line ; a reintroduced English muffin sandwich , a sandwich featuring ciabatta bread , a pair of breakfast bowls , and a non-alcoholic mimosa . In September , a slightly modified variation of the menu was taken national during one of the largest menu expansions in the company 's history . Chief Marketing Officer Mike Kappitt said breakfast produced 12 percent of the company 's income , but that was only half of what McDonald 's made . Part of the expansion was a major advertising campaign that encouraged people to change their minds about skipping breakfast at a time of high unemployment . 3G Capital has continued the expansion of the breakfast program with the introduction of Quaker Oats Company oatmeal to its menu in late 2011 . Oatmeal has been shown to be a popular addition to breakfast menus industry - wide due to its low cost , ease in preparation and perception as a healthy , whole - grain option . Analysts from industry analytic firm Technomic stated that it was a good move for Burger King to add a winning product to its menu , but that it should have tried to be more creative by adding other , similar products such as grits .
