On 15 March 1981 , the Salvadoran Army began a `` sweep '' operation in Cabañas Department in northern El Salvador near the Honduran border . The sweep was accompanied by the use of scorched earth tactics by the Salvadoran Army and indiscriminate killings of anyone captured by the army . Those displaced by the `` sweep '' who were not killed outright fled the advance of the Salvadoran Army ; hiding in caves and under trees to evade capture and probable summary execution . On 18 March , three days after the sweep in Cabañas began , 4 - 8,000 survivors of the sweep ( mostly women and children ) attempted to cross the Rio Lempa into Honduras to flee violence . There , they were caught between Salvadoran and Honduran troops . The Salvadoran Air Force , subsequently bombed and strafed the fleeing civilians with machine gun fire , killing hundreds . Among the dead were at least 189 persons who were unaccounted for and registered as `` disappeared '' during the operation .
