The distinctions between the two geese have led to confusion and debate among ornithologists . This has been aggravated by the overlap between the small types of Canada goose and larger types of cackling goose . The old `` lesser Canada goose '' was believed to be a partly hybrid population , with the birds named B. c. taverneri considered a mixture of B. c. minima , B. c. occidentalis , and B. c. parvipes . In addition , the barnacle goose has been determined to be a derivative of the cackling goose lineage , whereas the Hawaiian goose is derived from the Canada goose .
