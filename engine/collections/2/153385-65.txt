The magazine 's format was changed beginning with the April 11 , 2004 , issue to start the week 's listings in each issue on Sunday ( the day in which television listings magazines supplemented in newspapers traditionally began each week 's listings information ) , rather than Saturday . In July 2004 , the overnight listings were removed entirely , replaced by a grid that ran from 11 : 00 p.m. to 2 : 00 a.m. that included only the broadcast stations in each edition 's home market and a handful of cable channels . It also listed a small selection of late - night movies airing on certain channels . The time period of the listings in the daytime grids also shifted from starting at 5 : 00 a.m. and ending at 5 : 00 p.m. to running from 7 : 00 a.m. to 7 : 00 p.m. By this point , the log listings were restricted to programs airing from 7 : 00 to 11 : 00 p.m. In early 2005 , more channels were added to the prime time and late - night grids .
