Nucleic acids DNA and RNA are of great importance because they code for the production of all cellular proteins . They are made up of monomers called nucleotides which consist of an organic base : A , G , C and T or U , a pentose sugar , and a phosphate group . They have backbones in which the 3 ' carbon of the ribose sugar is connected to the phosphate group via a phosphodiester bond . This bond is formed through the with the help of a class of cellular enzymes called polymerases . In this enzymatically driven condensation reaction all incoming nucleotides have a triphosphorylated ribose which loses a pyrophosphate group to form the inherent phosphodiester bond . This reaction is driven by the large negative free energy change associated with the release of pyrophosphate . The sequence of bases in the nucleic acid backbone is also known as the primary structure . Nucleic acids can be millions of nucleotides long thus leading to the genetic diversity of life . The bases stick out from the pentose - phosphate polymer backbone in DNA and are hydrogen bonded in pairs to their complementary partners ( A with T and G with C ) . This creates a double helix with pentose phosphate backbones on either side , thus forming a secondary structure .
