There are many variations of the original cube , some of which are made by Rubik . The mechanical products include the Rubik 's Magic , 360 , and Twist . Also , electronics like the Rubik 's Revolution and Slide were also inspired by the original . One of the newest 3 × 3 × 3 Cube variants is the Rubik 's TouchCube . Sliding a finger across its faces causes its patterns of coloured lights to rotate the same way they would on a mechanical cube . The TouchCube also has buttons for hints and self - solving , and it includes a charging stand . The TouchCube was introduced at the American International Toy Fair in New York on February 15 , 2009 .
