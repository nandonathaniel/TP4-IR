Traditionally , the field has been applied radially -- in and away from the rotation axis of the motor . However some designs have the field flowing along the axis of the motor , with the rotor cutting the field lines as it rotates . This allows for much stronger magnetic fields , particularly if halbach arrays are employed . This , in turn , gives power to the motor at lower speeds . However , the focused flux density can not rise about the limited residual flux density of the permanent magnet despite high coercivity and like all electric machines , the flux density of magnetic core saturation is the design constraint .
