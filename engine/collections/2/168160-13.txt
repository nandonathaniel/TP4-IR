States that were granted waivers from AFDC program rules to run mandatory welfare - to - work programs were also required to rigorously evaluate the success of their programs . As a result , many types of mandatory welfare - to - work programs were evaluated in the early 1990s . While reviews of such programs found that almost all programs led to significant increases in employment and reductions in welfare rolls , there was little evidence that income among former welfare recipients had increased . In effect , increases in earnings from jobs were offset by losses in public income , leading many to conclude that these programs had no anti-poverty effects . However , the findings that welfare - to - work programs did have some effect in reducing dependence on government increased support among policymakers for moving welfare recipients into employment .
