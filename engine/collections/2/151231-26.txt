While Fisher was on a mission in Iceland , he was informed that Sarah was allegedly killed by a drunk driver in late 2007 or early 2008 ; however , three years later , he heard a rumor that her death was no accident and went to Malta to investigate . After being captured by Third Echelon in Malta , Grim revealed that Sarah is alive but if Sam wanted to see his daughter again he had to help her investigate Tom Reed . At Third Echelon HQ , Grim played a recording that Lambert made before his death in New York explaining that Sarah 's death was faked to prevent her from being used as leverage by a mole inside Third Echelon to compromise Sam and the agency . After learning of this revelation , Sam reluctantly continued to help Grim in stopping Reed from assassinating the President , all the while reuniting with his daughter and retiring from government work .
