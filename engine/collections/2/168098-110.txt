This was the second murder that Birley was convicted of . In 1996 , Birley had been convicted of the murder of 69 - year - old Maurice Hoyle in his house in Barnsley and served 18 years of a life sentence before being released on licence . As a result of having already been convicted of one murder , Birley was given a whole - life tariff for the murder of Mr Gogarty . His partner , Helen Nichols , was told she must serve a minimum of 20 years for her part in the murder .
