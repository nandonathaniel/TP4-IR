In 1936 the U.S. court ruled in U.S. v. One Package that medically prescribing contraception to save a persons life or well being was not illegal under the Comstock Law ; following this decision , the American Medical Association Committee on Contraception revoked its 1936 statement condemning birth control . A national survey in 1937 showed 71 percent of the adult population supported the use of contraception . By 1938 347 birth control clinics were running in the United States despite their advertisement still being illegal . First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt publicly supported birth control and family planning . In 1966 , President Lyndon B. Johnson started endorsing public funding for family planning services , and the Federal Government began subsidizing birth control services for low - income families . The Affordable Care Act , passed into law on March 23 , 2010 under President Barack Obama , requires all plans in the Health Insurance Marketplace to cover contraceptive methods . These include barrier methods , hormonal methods , implanted devices , emergency contraceptives , and sterilization procedures .
