The `` position of trust under 18 '' anti-exploitation rules were expanded in 2005 by Bill C - 2 where a judge may choose to term a situation to be sexual exploitation based on the nature and circumstances of the relationship including the age of the younger party , age difference , evolution of the relationship ( how it developed , e.g. quickly and secretly over the Internet ) , the control or influence over the young person ( degree of control or influence the other person had over the young person ) . This passed before the 2008 amendments , and they were not repealed so they are still in effect and can apply towards adults in these situations with young persons over the age of consent and under 18 ( 16 - 17 ) .
