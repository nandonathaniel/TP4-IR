In the 11th and 12th centuries thinkers argued that human society consisted of three orders : those who pray , those who fight , and those who labour . The structure of the first order , the clergy , was in place by 1200 and remained singly intact until the religious reformations of the 16th century . The very general category of those who labour ( specifically , those who were not knightly warriors or nobles ) diversified rapidly after the 11th century into the lively and energetic worlds of peasants , skilled artisans , merchants , financiers , lay professionals , and entrepreneurs , which together drove the European economy to its greatest achievements . The second order , those who fight , was the rank of the politically powerful , ambitious , and dangerous . Kings took pains to ensure that it did not resist their authority .
