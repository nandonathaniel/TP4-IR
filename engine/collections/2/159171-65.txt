On the other side of this debate , many judges hold the view that separation of powers means that the Judiciary is independent and untouchable within the judicial sphere . In this view , separation of powers means that the Judiciary alone holds all powers relative to the judicial function and that the Legislative and Executive branches may not interfere in any aspect of the Judicial branch . An example of the second view at the state level is found in the Florida Supreme Court holding that only the Florida Supreme Court may license and regulate attorneys appearing before the courts of Florida , and only the Florida Supreme Court may set rules for procedures in the Florida courts . The State of New Hampshire also follows this system .
