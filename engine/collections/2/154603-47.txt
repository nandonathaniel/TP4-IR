Promyelocytic leukaemia bodies ( PML bodies ) are spherical bodies found scattered throughout the nucleoplasm , measuring around 0.1 -- 1.0 Î¼m . They are known by a number of other names , including nuclear domain 10 ( ND10 ) , Kremer bodies , and PML oncogenic domains . PML bodies are named after one of their major components , the promyelocytic leukemia protein ( PML ) . They are often seen in the nucleus in association with Cajal bodies and cleavage bodies . PML bodies belong to the nuclear matrix , an ill - defined super-structure of the nucleus proposed to anchor and regulate many nuclear functions , including DNA replication , transcription , or epigenetic silencing . The PML protein is the key organizer of these domains that recruits an ever - growing number of proteins , whose only common known feature to date is their ability to be SUMOylated . Yet , pml - / - mice ( which have their PML gene deleted ) can not assemble nuclear bodies , develop normally and live well , demonstrating that PML bodies are dispensable for most basic biological functions .
