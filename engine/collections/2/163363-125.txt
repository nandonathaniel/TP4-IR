With effect from 3 April 2006 , the period of time required to obtain Indefinite Leave to Remain increases to five years . These changes were debated in House of Commons Standing Committee on 20 June 2006 . All Labour MPs voted for preserving the retroactive aspect of the changes , while all other MPs voted that the Government should bring in transitional arrangements to allow those already in the UK before the rule change to qualify under the previous four - year rule . These changes were protested in demonstrations and rallies in London on 16 June and 23 July 2006 .
