The Thamnophilidae contains several large or very large genera and numerous small or monotypic ones . Several , which are difficult to assign , seem to form a third , hitherto unrecognised clade independently derived from ancestral antbirds . The results also confirmed suspicions of previous researchers that some species , most notably in Myrmotherula and Myrmeciza , need to be assigned to other genera . Still , due to the difficulties of sampling from such a large number of often poorly known species , the assignment of some genera is still awaiting confirmation .
