In 1907 , he introduced a new candy , bite - sized , flat - bottomed , conical - shaped pieces of chocolate that he named `` Hershey 's Kiss '' . Initially , they were individually wrapped by hand in squares of aluminum foil , and the introduction of machine wrapping in 1921 simplified the process while adding the small paper ribbon to the top of the package to indicate that it was a genuine Hershey product . Today , 80 million of the candies are produced each day . Other products introduced included Mr. Goodbar ( 1925 ) , containing peanuts in milk chocolate , Hershey 's Syrup ( 1926 ) , semisweet chocolate chips ( 1928 ) , and the Krackel bar containing crisped rice ( 1938 ) .
