The oldest version of the modern name Shetland is Hetlandensis recorded in 1190 becoming Hetland in 1431 after various intermediate transformations . This then became Hjaltland in the 16th century . As Shetlandic Norn was gradually replaced by Scots Hjaltland became Èœetland . When use of the letter yogh was discontinued , it was often replaced by the similar - looking letter z , hence Zetland , the mis pronounced form used to describe the pre-1975 county council . However the earlier name is Innse Chat -- the island of the cats ( or the cat tribe ) as referred to in early Irish literature and it is just possible that this forms part of the Norse name . The Cat tribe also occupied parts of the northern Scottish mainland -- hence the name of Caithness via the Norse Katanes ( `` headland of the cat '' ) , and the Gaelic name for Sutherland , Cataibh , meaning `` among the Cats '' .
