The 1987 F - Series carried over the same body style from the seventh generation , yet sported a new rounded front clip that improved aerodynamics , as well as the softening of body lines around the rear of the bed and fender arches around the wheel wells . The interior was also completely redesigned in 1987 . The transmissions available on SuperCab models were a four - or five - speed manual ; regular cab models were also available with automatic transmission . The Custom trim made a comeback for the eighth generation . In 1988 , the 4.9 Liter inline - six , 5.8 Liter V8 , and 7.5 Liter V8 engines gained electronic fuel injection . International Navistar also increased the displacement of their 6.9 Liter V8 in the same year , resulting in the new 7.3 Liter unit . This was also the first year of a five - speed manual overdrive transmission , which included the Mazda M5OD in the F - 150s and the heavy - duty ZF5 in the F - 250s and F - 350s . Four - speed manuals were dropped as standard equipment after 1987 , but were available as a customer - ordered option until 1989 . In 1989 , the C6 three - speed automatic was replaced as the base automatic transmission with the E4OD , a four - speed electronically controlled automatic overdrive unit , though the C6 was still available as an option , mostly in F - 250s and F - 350s , until 1997 . Heavy - Duty models included F - 250s and F - 350s ( along with F - Super Dutys ) that were classified as incomplete vehicles only that were produced with no bed , but appeared as tow trucks , box trucks ( notably U-Haul ) , flatbed trucks , dump trucks and other models . Although the F - 250s , F - 250 HDs ( heavy duty ) , and F - 350s were built as a Chassis cab models only from 1987 to 1997 , owners can convert the models to pickup trucks . However General Pacheco , Argentina and São Bernardo do Campo , Brazil assemblies were the only places F - 250 , F - 250 HD , and F - 350 were built and sold as pickup trucks models . Despite being produced only in General Pacheco , Argentina and São Bernardo do Campo , Brazil assemblies ( located in South America ) F - 250s , F - 250 HDs , and F - 350s were shipped from South America to the United States as imports from 1987 to 1997 .
