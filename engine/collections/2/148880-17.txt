The constitutional provisions in relation to use of the official language in legislation at the State level largely mirror those relating to the official language at the central level , with minor variations . State legislatures may conduct their business in their official language , Hindi or ( for a transitional period , which the legislature can extend if it so chooses ) English , and members who can not use any of these have the same rights to their mother tongue with the Speaker 's permission . The authoritative text of all laws must be in English , unless Parliament passes a law permitting a state to use another language , and if the original text of a law is in a different language , an authoritative English translation of all laws must be prepared .
