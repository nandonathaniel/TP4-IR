Prevention may be possible when therapy is targeted at those with early symptoms but is not effective when provided to all individuals whether or not symptoms are present . The main treatments for people with PTSD are counselling and medication . A number of different types of therapy may be useful . This may occur one - on - one or in a group . Antidepressants of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor type are the first - line medications for PTSD and result in benefit in about half of people . These benefits are less than those seen with therapy . It is unclear if using medications and therapy together has greater benefit . Other medications do not have enough evidence to support their use , and in the case of benzodiazepines , may worsen outcomes .
