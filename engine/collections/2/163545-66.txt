As of October 2010 , a series of new covers have been released . The first book 's cover is more or less the back cover of the normal cover ( only blue ) . The second cover is gold , the third is purple , the fourth is red , the fifth is green , the sixth is dark blue , the seventh is silver and the eighth is yellow . The new mass market paperback edition covers all feature Skulduggery on the front and Valkyrie on the back . Some were released with a short story set a few months after the plot of the novel . Landy stated on his blog that these stories will be gradually removed from the reprints of the books and instead published in a collection of short stories in early 2014 .
