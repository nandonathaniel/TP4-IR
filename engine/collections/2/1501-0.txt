An azeotrope ( UK / əˈziːəˌtrəʊp / , US / əˈziəˌtroʊp / ) or a constant boiling point mixture is a mixture of two or more liquids whose proportions can not be altered or changed by simple distillation . This happens because when an azeotrope is boiled , the vapour has the same proportions of constituents as the unboiled mixture .
