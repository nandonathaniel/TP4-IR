It is believed that the last case of someone being executed by being pressed to death ( peine forte et dure ) , in the country , was carried out in 1735 at Horsham . At the assizes a man who pretended to be dumb and lame , was indicted for murder and robbery . When he was brought to the bar , he would not speak or plead . Witnesses told the court , that they had heard him speak so he was taken back to Horsham gaol . As he would not plead they laid 100 pounds ( 45 kg ) weight on him , then as he still would not plead , they added 100 pounds ( 45 kg ) more , and a further 100 pounds ( 45 kg ) making a total of 300 pounds ( 140 kg ) weight , still he would not speak ; so 50 pounds ( 23 kg ) more was added , when he was nearly dead , the executioner , who weighed about 16 stone ( 100 kg ) or 17 stone ( 110 kg ) , laid down upon the board which was over him , and killed him in an instant .
