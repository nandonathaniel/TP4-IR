The textbook method is to compare the observed value of F with the critical value of F determined from tables . The critical value of F is a function of the degrees of freedom of the numerator and the denominator and the significance level ( α ) . If F ≥ F , the null hypothesis is rejected . The computer method calculates the probability ( p - value ) of a value of F greater than or equal to the observed value . The null hypothesis is rejected if this probability is less than or equal to the significance level ( α ) .
