Planning for the operation began in 1943 . In the months leading up to the invasion , the Allies conducted a substantial military deception , codenamed Operation Bodyguard , to mislead the Germans as to the date and location of the main Allied landings . The weather on D - Day was far from ideal and the operation had to be delayed 24 hours ; a further postponement would have meant a delay of at least two weeks as the invasion planners had requirements for the phase of the moon , the tides , and the time of day that meant only a few days each month were deemed suitable . Adolf Hitler placed German Field Marshal Erwin Rommel in command of German forces and of developing fortifications along the Atlantic Wall in anticipation of an Allied invasion .
