Minuit is generally credited with orchestrating the purchase of Manhattan Island for the Dutch from the Lenape Native Americans . Manhattan later became the site of the Dutch city of New Amsterdam , modern - day New York City . A common myth states that Minuit purchased Manhattan for $24 worth of trinkets ; However , a letter written by Dutch merchant Peter Schaghen to directors of the Dutch East India Company stated that Manhattan was purchased `` for the value of 60 guilders , '' an amount worth around $1,050 in 2015 dollars . Minuit also founded the Delaware colony in the early 1600s .
