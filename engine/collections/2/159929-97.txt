Zim desires to bring his masters to Earth to witness his next plan for world domination involving a brain parasite , so he remotely takes control of the `` Massive '' . However , at the time he takes control , the Tallest are under attack from a resistance group known as `` The Resisty '' ( a name met with breathtaking laughter from the Tallest ) . Meanwhile , Dib has been attempting to salvage / reverse engineer Tak 's spaceship ( which he acquired in `` Tak : The Hideous New Girl '' ) and manages to repair enough of its systems to establish a remote connection of his own to get into Zim 's computer and wrestle for control of the Tallest 's ship . When the Tallest realize what 's going on , they transfer Zim 's control over to the Resisty so he brings their ship in and they self - destruct . The Tallest then contact Zim to punish him for what he has done , only to find that he 's under attack from the brain parasite .
