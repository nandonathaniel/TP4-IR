Although there is no direct literary source for the induction , the tale of a tinker being duped into believing he is a lord is one found in many literary traditions . Such a story is recorded in Arabian Nights where Harun al - Rashid plays the same trick on a man he finds sleeping in an alley . Another is found in De Rebus Burgundicis by the Dutch historian Pontus de Huyter , where Philip , Duke of Burgundy , after attending his sister 's wedding in Portugal , finds a drunken `` artisan '' whom he entertains with a `` pleasant Comedie . '' Arabian Nights was not translated into English until the mid 18th century , although Shakespeare may have known it by word of mouth . He could also have known the Duke of Burgundy story as , although De Rebus was n't translated into French until 1600 , and into English until 1607 , there is evidence the story existed in English in a jest book ( now lost ) by Richard Edwardes , written in 1570 .
