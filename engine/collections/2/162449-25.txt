The Roman hegemony over the Mediterranean areas resulted in the substitution of glassblowing for earlier Hellenistic casting , core - forming and mosaic fusion techniques . The earliest evidence of blowing in Hellenistic work consists of small blown bottles for perfume and oil retrieved from the glass workshops on the Greek island of Samothrace and at Corinth in mainland Greece which were dated to the 1st century AD .
