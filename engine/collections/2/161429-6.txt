Tin - plates were a major import for the United States ; tens of millions of dollars in these goods entered the country each year . In the preceding 20 years tariff rates had been raised and dropped multiple times on tin - plates with no change in import levels , and domestic production had remained inconsequential . In a last attempt to stimulate the infant domestic tin - plate industry , the 1890 tariff raised the duty level from thirty percent to seventy percent . The Act also included a unique provision that stated tin - plates should be admitted free of any duty after 1897 , unless domestic production in any year reached one third the imports in that year . The goal was for the duty to be protective , or not exist at all .
