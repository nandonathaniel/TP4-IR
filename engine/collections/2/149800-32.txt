A laptop 's central processing unit ( CPU ) has advanced power - saving features and produces less heat than one intended purely for desktop use . Typically , laptop CPUs have two processor cores , although 4 - core models are also available . For low price and mainstream performance , there is no longer a significant performance difference between laptop and desktop CPUs , but at the high end , the fastest 4 - to - 8 - core desktop CPUs still substantially outperform the fastest 4 - core laptop processors , at the expense of massively higher power consumption and heat generation ; the fastest laptop processors top out at 56 watts of heat , while the fastest desktop processors top out at 150 watts .
