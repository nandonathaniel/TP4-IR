Allusions to myth were very widespread in Egyptian art and architecture . In temple design , the central path of the temple axis was likened to the sun god 's path across the sky , and the sanctuary at the end of the path represented the place of creation from which he rose . Temple decoration was filled with solar emblems that underscored this relationship . Similarly , the corridors of tombs were linked with the god 's journey through the Duat , and the burial chamber with the tomb of Osiris . The pyramid , the best - known of all Egyptian architectural forms , may have been inspired by mythic symbolism , for it represented the mound of creation and the original sunrise , appropriate for a monument intended to assure the owner 's rebirth after death . Symbols in Egyptian tradition were frequently reinterpreted , so that the meanings of mythical symbols could change and multiply over time like the myths themselves .
