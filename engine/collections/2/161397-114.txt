Aside from the 32 picks each club gets , compensatory draft picks are given to teams that have lost more compensatory free agents than they have gained . These are spread out from rounds 3 to 7 , and a total of 32 are given . Clubs are required to make their selection within a certain period of time , the exact time depending on which round the pick is made in . If they fail to do so on time , the clubs behind them can begin to select their players in order , but they do not lose the pick outright . This happened in the 2003 draft , when the Minnesota Vikings failed to make their selection on time . The Jacksonville Jaguars and Carolina Panthers were able to make their picks before the Vikings were able to use theirs . Selected players are only allowed to negotiate contracts with the team that picked them , but if they choose not to sign they become eligible for the next year 's draft . Under the current collective bargaining contract , all contracts to drafted players must be four - year deals with a club option for a fifth . Contracts themselves are limited to a certain amount of money , depending on the exact draft pick the player was selected with . Players who were draft eligible but not picked in the draft are free to sign with any club .
