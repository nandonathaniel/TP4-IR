On October 29 , 2012 , Hurricane Sandy caused extensive damage to low - lying coastal areas of Brooklyn , Queens , Nassau and Suffolk counties , destroying or severely damaging thousands of area homes and other structures by ocean and bay storm surges . Hundreds of thousands of residents were left without electric power for periods of time ranging up to several weeks while the damage was being repaired . The slow - moving `` Superstorm Sandy '' ( so - nicknamed because its winds weakened below hurricane intensity as it made landfall ) caused 90 % of Long Island households to lose power and an estimated $18 billion in damages in Nassau & Suffolk Counties alone . The storm also had a devastating impact on coastal communities in the Brooklyn and Queens portions of the island , including Coney Island in Brooklyn and the Rockaway Peninsula in Queens , although estimates of monetary damages there are usually calculated as part of the overall losses suffered in New York City as a whole . The extent of Sandy 's damages is second only to those caused by the 1938 Long Island Express , when adjusted for inflation . Although a lower central pressure was recorded in Sandy , the National Hurricane Center estimates that the 1938 hurricane had a lower pressure at landfall . Hurricane Sandy and its profound impacts have prompted the discussion of constructing seawalls and other coastal barriers around the shorelines of Long Island and New York City to minimize the risk of destructive consequences from another such event in the future .
