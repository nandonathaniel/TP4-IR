Skaters are generally free to select their own attire , with a few restrictions . In competition , females may wear a dress , typically with matching attached briefs , and since 2004 , they may also choose trousers . They may wear opaque flesh - colored leggings or tights under dresses and skirts , which may extend to cover their skates . Men must wear trousers -- they are not allowed to wear tights , although , officials do not always impose a deduction for violations . Matching costumes are not required in pair skating and ice dance .
