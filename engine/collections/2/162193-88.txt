Although Colorado voters approved the constitutional amendment legalizing retail sales of marijuana for recreational purposes , the amendment and enabling legislation also provided that localities could limit or ban retail outlets within a city or unincorporated portion of a county through a `` local option '' . The provisions of Amendment 64 concerning personal use are not affected by the local bans on retail sales , so that growing and possession of small quantities of `` personal '' pot in are legal statewide under state ( but not federal ) law . Most localities have chosen to ban retail stores , at least temporarily .
