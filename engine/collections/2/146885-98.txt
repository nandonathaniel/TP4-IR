Domestic offtake further reduced silver in circulation , as the improving fortunes of the merchant class led to increased demand for tablewares . Silversmiths had always regarded coinage as a source of raw material , already verified for fineness by the government . As a result , sterling coins were being melted and fashioned into sterling silverware at an accelerating rate . A 1697 Act of Parliament tried to stem this tide by raising the minimum acceptable fineness on wrought plate from sterling 's 92.5 % to a new Britannia silver standard of 95.83 % . Silverware made purely from melted coins would be found wanting when the silversmith took his wares to the Assay Office , thus discouraging the melting of coins .
