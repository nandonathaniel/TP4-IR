Two broad canals link the river to other river basins : the Kennet and Avon Canal ( Reading to Bath ) and the Grand Union Canal ( London to the Midlands ) . The Grand Union effectively bypassed the earlier , narrow and winding Oxford Canal which also remains open as a popular scenic recreational route . Three further cross-basin canals are disused but are in various stages of reconstruction : the Thames and Severn Canal ( via Stroud ) , which operated until 1927 ( to the west coast of England ) , the Wey and Arun Canal to Littlehampton , which operated until 1871 ( to the south coast ) , and the Wilts and Berks Canal .
