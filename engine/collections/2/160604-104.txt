It came to a head in the middle of the war with the writing of a column in the New York World - Telegram by Pegler , who alleged that merchant seamen refused to work on Sundays per union rules , causing sick USMC servicemen to unload their own supplies in an incident off Guadalcanal . He went on to say that these seamen received `` fabulous pay for sailors , including overtime bonuses , whereas the navy men draw only the modest pay for their ratings without extras . '' This was a specific allegation , and in February 1943 , the National Maritime Union , representing seven other unions , filed suit for libel against Hearst Newspapers , publisher of the newspaper , and the Associated Press for its wide dissemination of what was claimed to be an untrue story . As part of their suit , they pointed out that Government allotments for families , low - rate premiums on insurance , hospitalization , dental care , pension , and civil service rating consideration tend to balance the pay of ordinary seamen in civilian service . But they denied the incident ever took place , and were backed by a report of Admiral William F. Halsey , commander of United States forces in the South Pacific , to the Navy Department in which Halsey praised the `` co-operation , efficiency and courage '' of the merchant seamen and asserted that `` In no instance have merchant marine seamen refused to discharge cargo from their vessels or in any other way failed to co-operate with the United States forces ashore in that ( South Pacific ) area . '' They won their suit , but the residual effect would last for decades .
