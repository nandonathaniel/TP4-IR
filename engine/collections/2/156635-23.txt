Assuming that one person drinks water and one owns a zebra , then it is possible not only to deduce the answers to the two questions , but to figure out a complete solution of who lives where , in what color house , keeping what pet , drinking what drink , and smoking what brand of cigarettes . By considering the clues a few at a time , it is possible to slowly build inferences that incrementally complete the puzzle 's unique correct solution . For example , by clue 10 , the Norwegian lives in house # 1 , and by clue 15 , house # 2 must be blue . The Norwegian 's house therefore can not be blue , nor can it be red , where the Englishman lives ( clue 2 ) , or green or ivory , which are next to each other ( clue 6 ) . It must therefore be yellow , which means the Norwegian also smokes Kools ( clue 8 ) .
