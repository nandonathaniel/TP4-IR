As a state dependent on both smokestack industry and scenic tourism , New Mexico was at the center of the debates over clean air legislation , particularly the Clean Air Act of 1967 and its amendments in 1970 and 1977 . The Kennecott Copper Corporation , which operated a large smelter at Hurley , New Mexico , generating as a byproduct thick clouds of air pollution , led the opposition to the environmentalists , represented by the New Mexico Citizens for Clean Air and Water . Eventually the company was forced to comply with fairly strict federal standards . They often delayed the compliance process for years by threatening economic repercussions , such as plant closings and unemployment , if forced to comply with standards .
