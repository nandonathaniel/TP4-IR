On November 23 , 1993 , Guns N ' Roses released a collection of punk and glam rock covers entitled `` The Spaghetti Incident ? '' Izzy Stradlin 's recorded guitar parts were replaced by Gilby Clarke . Many of the tracks were recorded during the same sessions as the Illusions albums , which were originally intended to produce 3 or 4 albums . Initially , the band was going to release a covers EP in 1992 or 1993 , but decided on making a full album and recorded more songs . Bassist Duff McKagan sings on many of the album 's tracks and Hanoi Rocks frontman Michael Monroe appears on `` Ai n't It Fun '' as a guest vocalist . Slash described the recording of the album as `` spontaneous and unpainted '' . The title of the album is an inside joke referring to a food fight that occurred between Axl Rose and Steven Adler . During his lawsuit against the band , Adler 's attorney described the food fight as `` the Spaghetti Incident '' . The meaning was explained by drummer Matt Sorum in a 1994 interview with Much Music and confirmed by Slash in his autobiography , Slash .
