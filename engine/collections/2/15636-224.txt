Brazil 's return to democracy in 1985 after over 20 years of military authoritarian rule , and the subsequent end of rampant censorship , allowed for a new freedom of expression which promoted creativity and experimentation in expressive culture . Commercial and cultural imports from Europe and North America have often influenced Brazil 's own cultural output . For example , the hip hop that has stemmed from New York is localized into forms of musical production such as Funk Carioca and Brazilian hip hop . Bands from Rio de Janeiro also had influence in the mid-to - late development of the Punk in Brazil , and that of Brazilian thrash metal . Democratic renewal also allowed for the recognition and acceptance of this diversification of Brazilian culture . Rio de Janeiro is also the homeland of the biggest entertainment event in the world , the Rock in Rio Festival , which had editions in 1985 , 1991 , 2001 , 2011 , 2013 , 2015 and 2017 .
