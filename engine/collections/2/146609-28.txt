The macula densa 's detection of elevated sodium chloride , which leads to a decrease in GFR , is based on the concept of purinergic signaling . An increase in the salt concentration causes several cell signals to eventually cause the adjacent afferent arteriole to constrict . This decreases the amount of blood coming from the afferent arterioles to the glomerular capillaries , and therefore decreases the amount of fluid that goes from the glomerular capillaries into the Bowman 's space ( the glomerular filtration rate ( GFR ) ) .
