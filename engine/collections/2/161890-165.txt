The best - known popular culture response to the deaths at Kent State was the protest song `` Ohio '' , written by Neil Young for Crosby , Stills , Nash & Young . They promptly recorded the song , and preview discs ( acetates ) were rushed to major radio stations , although the group already had a hit song , `` Teach Your Children '' , on the charts at the time . Within two and a half weeks of the Kent State shootings , `` Ohio '' was receiving national airplay . Crosby , Stills , and Nash visited the Kent State campus for the first time on May 4 , 1997 , where they performed the song for the May 4 Task Force 's 27th annual commemoration .
