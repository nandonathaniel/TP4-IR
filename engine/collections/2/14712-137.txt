Pernicious anemia is caused by a lack of intrinsic factor , which is required to absorb vitamin B from food . A lack of intrinsic factor may arise from an autoimmune condition targeting the parietal cells ( atrophic gastritis ) that produce intrinsic factor or against intrinsic factor itself . These lead to poor absorption of vitamin B . Macrocytic anemia can also be caused by removal of the functional portion of the stomach , such as during gastric bypass surgery , leading to reduced vitamin B / folate absorption . Therefore , one must always be aware of anemia following this procedure .
