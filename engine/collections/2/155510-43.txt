Bacchus , the god of wine - for the Greeks , Dionysus - is the patron deity of agriculture and the theater . He was also known as the Liberator ( Eleutherios ) , freeing one from one 's normal self , by madness , ecstasy , or wine . The divine mission of Dionysus was to mingle the music of the aulos and to bring an end to care and worry . The Romans would hold dinner parties where wine was served to the guest all day along with a three course feast . Scholars have discussed Dionysus ' relationship to the `` cult of the souls '' and his ability to preside over communication between the living and the dead .
