The electron affinity of an atom can be described either as the energy released by an atom when an electron is added to it , conversely as the energy required to detach an electron from a singly charged anion . The sign of the electron affinity can be quite confusing , as atoms that become more stable with the addition of an electron ( and so are considered to have a higher electron affinity ) show a decrease in potential energy ; i.e. the energy gained by the atom appears to be negative . For atoms that become less stable upon gaining an electron , potential energy increases , which implies that the atom gains energy . In such a case , the atom 's electron affinity value is positive . Consequently , atoms with a more negative electron affinity value are considered to have a higher electron affinity ( they are more receptive to gaining electrons ) , and vice versa . However , in the reverse scenario where electron affinity is defined as the energy required to detach an electron from an anion , the energy value obtained will be of the same magnitude but have the opposite sign . This is because those atoms with a high electron affinity are less inclined to give up an electron , and so take more energy to remove the electron from the atom . In this case , the atom with the more positive energy value has the higher electron affinity . As one progresses from left to right across a period , the electron affinity will increase .
