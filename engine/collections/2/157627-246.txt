There was an extensive maritime trade network operating between the Harappan and Mesopotamian civilisations as early as the middle Harappan Phase , with much commerce being handled by `` middlemen merchants from Dilmun '' ( modern Bahrain and Failaka located in the Persian Gulf ) . Such long - distance sea trade became feasible with the development of plank - built watercraft , equipped with a single central mast supporting a sail of woven rushes or cloth .
