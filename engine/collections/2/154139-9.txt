A floating - point system can be used to represent , with a fixed number of digits , numbers of different orders of magnitude : e.g. the distance between galaxies or the diameter of an atomic nucleus can be expressed with the same unit of length . The result of this dynamic range is that the numbers that can be represented are not uniformly spaced ; the difference between two consecutive representable numbers grows with the chosen scale .
