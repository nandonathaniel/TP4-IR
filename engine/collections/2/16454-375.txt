Old Dominion enjoyed nearly as large an advantage in 1983 when the Final Four was played at the Norfolk Scope in its home city of Norfolk , Virginia , but also lost its semifinal . The Scope has never been the Lady Monarchs ' regular home court . ODU has always used on - campus arenas , first the ODU Fieldhouse and since 2002 the Ted Constant Convocation Center . The following year , USC won the national title at Pauley Pavilion , the home court of its Los Angeles arch - rival UCLA .
