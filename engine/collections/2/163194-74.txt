When used in the name of an instrument , these terms are relative , describing the instrument 's range in comparison to other instruments of its family and not in comparison to the human voice range or instruments of other families . For example , a bass flute 's range is from C to F â™¯ , while a bass clarinet plays about one octave lower .
