Thomas Harris has given few interviews , and did not explain where he got inspiration for Hannibal Lecter until mid-2013 . Harris revealed that the character was inspired by a real - life doctor and murderer he met while visiting a prison in the city of Monterrey during a trip to Mexico in the 1960s when he was a 23 - year - old reporter . The doctor was serving a life sentence for murdering a young man , supposedly a `` close friend '' , mutilating his body into several body parts and putting them in a very small box . Harris , who would only refer to the surgeon by the fake name `` Dr. Salazar '' , described him as a `` small lithe pale man with dark red hair '' . He added : `` There was certain intelligence and elegance about him . '' Harris had gone to Mexico to interview Dykes Askew Simmons , a US citizen on death row for murdering three young people in the country , but he ended up also speaking to `` Salazar '' , who saved Simmons ' life after a guard shot him during an escape bid . `` Salazar '' revealed his dark side as he began discussing Simmons ' disfigured face , tormented upbringing and how attractive his victims had been .
