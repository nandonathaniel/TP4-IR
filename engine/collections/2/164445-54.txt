Kajganich worked with Lin , Lee , and Davison on The Invasion ( 2007 ) , and he knew they would champion good storytelling , and allow him the time to work out a solid first draft of the screenplay . Kajganich spoke of the remake being set in the , `` mid-1980s and in the present ... mirroring the twenty - odd - year gap King uses in the book ... and with a great deal of care and attention paid to the backstories of all the characters '' .
