The ideas on what exactly constituted this `` liberating insight '' was not fixed but developed over time . According to Bronkhorst , in earliest Buddhism the four truths did not serve as a description of `` liberating insight '' . Initially the term prajna served to denote this `` liberating insight . '' Later on , prajna was replaced in the suttas by the `` four truths . '' This happened in those texts where practicing the four jhanas preceded the attainment of `` liberating insight , '' and where this practice of the four jhanas then culminates in `` liberating insight . '' This `` liberating insight '' came to be defined as `` insight into the four truths , '' which is presented as the `` liberating insight '' which constituted the awakening , or `` enlightenment '' of the Buddha . When he understood these truths he was `` enlightened '' and liberated , as reflected in Majjhima Nikaya 26 : 42 : `` his taints are destroyed by his seeing with wisdom . ''
