So , we had won after all ! ... We had won the war . England would live ; Britain would live ; the Commonwealth of Nations and the Empire would live . How long the war would last or in what fashion it would end no man could tell , nor did I at this moment care ... We should not be wiped out . Our history would not come to an end . We might not even have to die as individuals . Hitler 's fate was sealed . Mussolini 's fate was sealed . As for the Japanese , they would be ground to powder . All the rest was merely the proper application of overwhelming force .
