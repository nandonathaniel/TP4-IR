The recent geological history of Victoria Falls can be seen in the form of the gorges below the falls . The basalt plateau over which the Upper Zambezi flows has many large cracks filled with weaker sandstone . In the area of the current falls the largest cracks run roughly east to west ( some run nearly north - east to south - west ) , with smaller north - south cracks connecting them .
