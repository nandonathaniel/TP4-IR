In 1840 , Belgium began to act as an external source of support for Carrera 's independence movement , in an effort to exert influence in Central America . The Compagnie belge de colonisation ( Belgian Colonization Company ) , commissioned by Belgian King Leopold I , became the administrator of Santo Tomas de Castilla replacing the failed British Eastern Coast of Central America Commercial and Agricultural Company . Even though the colony eventually crumbled , Belgium continued to support Carrera in the mid-19th century , although Britain continued to be the main business and political partner to Carrera 's regime . Rafael Carrera was elected Guatemalan Governor in 1844 .
