At the climax , Timmy and Vicky enter Maho Mushi and appear in a fighting arena . They use the power of their remotes to battle each other , control giant fighting robots to battle each other , fire blasts from the remote , and use the remotes as glowing swords to attack each other . Battling to a stalemate , Timmy realizes the only way to defeat Vicky is to become old enough that Cosmo and Wanda 's magic goes away , and the remotes will stop working . He ages himself all the way to age eighteen , and the remotes stop working . However , the Fairy Taxi arrives to take Cosmo and Wanda away . The fairies resist , so a tractor beam begins to suck them toward the taxi . Before it can get them both , the fairies make Timmy 10 years old again , so he gets to keep his fairies . Timmy gets both of the remotes back and recharges their power , using them to blast Vicky out of television and back into her room . She lands roughly in her bed , thinking it was all a dream . However , Vicky gets a cryptic message attached to a Timmy doll through the window of her bedroom , telling that Vicky is in really big trouble . Timmy has finally won the battle as he , Cosmo and Wanda leave the program . Timmy is still worried that his parents are still mad at him for what he has done .
