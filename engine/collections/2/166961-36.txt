Rome 's early enemies were the neighbouring hill tribes of the Volscians , the Aequi , and of course the Etruscans . As years passed and military successes increased Roman territory , new adversaries appeared . The fiercest were the Gauls , a loose collective of peoples who controlled much of Northern Europe including what is modern North and Central - East Italy .
