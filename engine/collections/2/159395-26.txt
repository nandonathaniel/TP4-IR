As was the custom , Congress appointed a committee to draft a preamble to explain the purpose of the resolution . John Adams wrote the preamble , which stated that because King George had rejected reconciliation and was hiring foreign mercenaries to use against the colonies , `` it is necessary that the exercise of every kind of authority under the said crown should be totally suppressed '' . Adams 's preamble was meant to encourage the overthrow of the governments of Pennsylvania and Maryland , which were still under proprietary governance . Congress passed the preamble on May 15 after several days of debate , but four of the middle colonies voted against it , and the Maryland delegation walked out in protest . Adams regarded his May 15 preamble effectively as an American declaration of independence , although a formal declaration would still have to be made .
