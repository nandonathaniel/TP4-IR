Goku uses Tien 's Solar Flare technique to blind the Great Ape Vegeta in order to buy time to create a Spirit Bomb , but Vegeta attacks Goku the instant he finishes gathering ki . Even in his battered state , Goku manages to wound Vegeta 's eye , but he ends up with Vegeta crushing him in his hand and breaking most of his body and bones in the process . While hiding , Gohan and Krillin watch the fight and try to come up with a plan to cut off Vegeta 's tail . They fail , but Yajirobe seizes an opening and severs Vegeta 's tail with his sword , forcing Vegeta to revert into his original form . Vegeta then angrily confronts Gohan , who is reluctant to fight at first , until he gets support from Goku . Goku then entrusts Krillin with the remaining ki from the Spirit Bomb .
