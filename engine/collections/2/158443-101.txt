In The History of Human Marriage ( 1922 ) , Edvard Westermarck defined marriage as `` a more or less durable connection between male and female lasting beyond the mere act of propagation till after the birth of the offspring . '' In The Future of Marriage in Western Civilization ( 1936 ) , he rejected his earlier definition , instead provisionally defining marriage as `` a relation of one or more men to one or more women that is recognized by custom or law '' .
