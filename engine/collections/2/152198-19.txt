Song dynasty ( 920 -- 1279 ) Daoist priest - doctors first recorded that tuberculosis , called shīzhài 尸 瘵 ( lit . `` corpse disease '' ) `` disease which changes a living being into a corpse '' , was caused by a specific parasite or pathogen , centuries earlier than their contemporaries in other countries . The Duanchu shizhai pin 斷 除 尸 瘵 品 `` On the Extermination of the Corpse Disease '' is the 23rd chapter in Daoist collection Wushang xuanyuan santian Yutang dafa 無 上 玄 元 三 天 玉堂 大法 `` Great Rites of the Jade Hall of the Three Heavens of the Supreme Mysterious Origins '' ( Daozang number 103 ) . The text has a preface dated 1126 , written by the Song dynasty Zhengyi Dao master Lu Shizhong 路 時 中 , who founded the Yutang dafa 玉堂 大法 tradition , but internal evidence reveals that the text could not have been written before 1158 .
