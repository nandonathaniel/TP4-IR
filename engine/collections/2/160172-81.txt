In the 15th century , the most important among all of the separate Christian kingdoms that made up the old Hispania were the Kingdom of Castile ( occupying northern and central portions of the Iberian Peninsula ) , the Kingdom of Aragon ( occupying northeastern portions of the peninsula ) , and the Kingdom of Portugal occupying the far western Iberian Peninsula . The rulers of the kingdoms of Castile and Aragon were allied with dynastic families in Portugal , France , and other neighboring kingdoms .
