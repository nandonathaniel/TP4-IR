In England , telling ghost stories , local legends , and other strange , bizarre , and fantastic `` winter stories '' ( as Charles Dickens -- author of A Christmas Carol - termed them ) is a centuries - old tradition , to which William Shakespeare contributed with The Winter 's Tale ( 1623 ) but which was well known even before Shakespeare 's time . ( In contrast , the Ireland , Scotland , and the USA favor Halloween as a time for telling ghostly tales . ) Colin Fleming details other contributors to this tradition in the Paris Review .
