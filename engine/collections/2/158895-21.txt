Elk or wapiti ( Cervus canadensis ) are the most abundant large mammal found in Yellowstone ; paleontological evidence confirms their continuous presence for at least 1,000 years . Yellowstone National Park was established in 1872 , when market hunting of all large grazing animals was rampant . Not until after 1886 , when the United States Army was called in to protect the park and wildlife slaughter was brought under control , did the large animals increase in number . In recent years , however , Yellowstone 's elk population has plummeted . The Northern Herd , the only herd that winters in the park , has declined from nearly 20,000 animals in 1994 to less than 4,000 in 2013 . Ecologists have linked this decline to a declining population of cutthroat trout in Yellowstone Lake , caused by invasive lake trout . With less fish to eat , grizzly bears began to eat more elk calves , causing a steep decline in elk numbers .
