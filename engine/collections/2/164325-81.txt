Tamamonomae ( 玉藻 の 前 , Tamamo no Mae ) Voiced by : Ayaka Kimura ( game ) , Kyoko Hikami ( anime ) Tamaonomae appears to be Meirin 's future form as a kitsune woman with nine tails , though she exists in a different world . The world is not book world , it is named Sen - Kai , which is greater than the library . In the anime , she and Meirin may simply be alternative versions of one another ; she described Meirin as her `` other self '' , which in context may mean that Meirin is her creation or an independent creature which fissioned off from Tamamonomae . But in another ( but same company 's ) game , she is a really Meirin 's future form . Despite her sexual and alcoholic tendencies , is not an unsympathetic character ; she has considerable insight into people and does some fairly altruistic things for some of the other characters ; she restores Mariel to human form , helps Gargantua to acknowledge the truth , returns the Hat to Eve and finally seems to have taken Gargantua 's henchmen in as permanent guests .
