Mian Muhammad Nawaz Sharif took oath as prime minister of Pakistan and leader of the house on 17 February 1997 . The new Assembly came into power with an overwhelming majority . The Article 58 ( 2 ) ( b ) was later on omitted from the Constitution vide 13th Amendment in the Constitution in April 1997 . It may be pertinent to note at this point that while , ostensibly , sixteen amendments have been made in the Constitution so far , the ninth and the eleventh Constitutional Amendments were , however , passed by the Senate alone and fifteenth by the National Assembly alone , hence these amendments lapsed . The fourteenth Amendment in the Constitution empowered a check on floor crossing of legislators .
