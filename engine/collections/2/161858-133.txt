On 16 June 1963 , also after the Limited Test Ban Treaty , the 1211th Test Squadron was inactivated , and its assets were re-designated as the 58th Weather Reconnaissance Squadron , and the unit activated on 1 February 1964 . The new designation created no change in unit mission , although the squadron then emerged into the `` Age of the F Troop '' . The `` F '' was from the assignment of the RB - 57F Canberra to the squadron . According to the official history of the `` F Troop 58th Weather Squadron , '' the RB - 57F proved itself to be an aircraft gifted with the capabilities of exceptional payload , high altitude , long - range performance , and extended loiter time , all of which were useful for taking air samples .
