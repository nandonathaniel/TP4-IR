In addition to the brilliance and virtuosity of Parker , the alto sax was also popularized in the 1950s by top saxophonists such as Sonny Stitt , Cannonball Adderley , Sonny Criss and Paul Desmond ( of the Dave Brubeck Quartet ) . The tenor sax , a popular form of saxophone as a solo instrument in jazz , was popularized by jazz greats such as Lester Young , Coleman Hawkins , Dexter Gordon , John Coltrane , Sonny Rollins , Stan Getz and Zoot Sims . The baritone sax , featured more in big bands ( notably by Harry Carney in the Duke Ellington Orchestra ) and larger ensembles than as a solo instrument , was popularized in jazz as a solo instrument within small groups by musicians such as Serge Chaloff , Gerry Mulligan , Pepper Adams and Leo Parker . The soprano saxophone was popularized by Sidney Bechet in early jazz , but then largely fell out of favor on the jazz scene until John Coltrane began to feature the instrument . Popular smooth jazz and contemporary pop musician Kenny G also uses the soprano sax as his principal instrument .
