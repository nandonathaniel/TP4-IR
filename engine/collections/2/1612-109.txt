Krugman wrote in March 2013 that by neglecting public investment and failing to create jobs , we are doing far more harm to future generations than merely passing along debt : `` Fiscal policy is , indeed , a moral issue , and we should be ashamed of what we 're doing to the next generation 's economic prospects . But our sin involves investing too little , not borrowing too much . '' Young workers face high unemployment and studies have shown their income may lag throughout their careers as a result . Teacher jobs have been cut , which could affect the quality of education and competitiveness of younger Americans .
