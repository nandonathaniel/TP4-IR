The computer case encloses most of the components of the system . It provides mechanical support and protection for internal elements such as the motherboard , disk drives , and power supplies , and controls and directs the flow of cooling air over internal components . The case is also part of the system to control electromagnetic interference radiated by the computer , and protects internal parts from electrostatic discharge . Large tower cases provide extra internal space for multiple disk drives or other peripherals and usually stand on the floor , while desktop cases provide less expansion room . All - in - one style designs from Apple , namely the iMac , and similar types , include a video display built into the same case . Portable and laptop computers require cases that provide impact protection for the unit . A current development in laptop computers is a detachable keyboard , which allows the system to be configured as a touch - screen tablet . Hobbyists may decorate the cases with colored lights , paint , or other features , in an activity called case modding .
