Starting in 1888 , Philipp Lenard , a student of Heinrich Hertz , conducted experiments to see whether cathode rays could pass out of the Crookes tube into the air . He built a Crookes tube ( later called a `` Lenard tube '' ) with a `` window '' in the end made of thin aluminum , facing the cathode so the cathode rays would strike it . He found that something came through , that would expose photographic plates and cause fluorescence . He measured the penetrating power of these rays through various materials . It has been suggested that at least some of these `` Lenard rays '' were actually X-rays .
