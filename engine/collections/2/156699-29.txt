The polarization has been present for only two close elections ( 2000 and 2004 ) . In the 1996 election , 31 U.S. states were `` blue '' ( i.e. , they voted for Democrat Bill Clinton ) and 19 `` red '' ( i.e. , they voted for Republican Bob Dole ) ( though at the time the current color scheme was not as universal as today ) . One trend that has been true for several election cycles is that states that vote Republican tend to be more rural and more sparsely populated ( thus having fewer electoral votes ) than states that vote Democratic .
