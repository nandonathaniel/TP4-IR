Freund was instrumental in developing a way to uniformly light the set so that each of the three cameras would pick up the same quality of image . Freund noted that a typical episode ( 20 -- 22 min . ) was shot in about 60 minutes , with one constant concern being the shades - of - gray contrast in the final print , as each stage of transmission and broadcast would exaggerate the contrast . Among other non-standard techniques used in filming the show , cans of paint ( in shades ranging from white to medium - gray ) were kept on set to `` paint out '' inappropriate shadows and disguise lighting flaws . Freund also pioneered `` flat lighting , '' in which everything is brightly lit to eliminate shadows and the need for endless relighting .
