Timbre , sometimes called `` color '' , or `` tone color , '' is the principal phenomenon that allows us to distinguish one instrument from another when both play at the same pitch and volume , a quality of a voice or instrument often described in terms like bright , dull , shrill , etc . It is of considerable interest in music theory , especially because it is one component of music that has as yet , no standardized nomenclature . It has been called `` ... the psychoacoustician 's multidimensional waste - basket category for everything that can not be labeled pitch or loudness , '' but can be accurately described and analyzed by Fourier analysis and other methods because it results from the combination of all sound frequencies , attack and release envelopes , and other qualities that a tone comprises .
