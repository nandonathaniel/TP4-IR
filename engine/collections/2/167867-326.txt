Since 1788 , English has been spoken in Oceania , and Australian English has developed as a first language of the vast majority of the inhabitants of the Australian continent , its standard accent being General Australian . The English of neighbouring New Zealand has to a lesser degree become an influential standard variety of the language . Australian and New Zealand English are each other 's closest relatives with few differentiating characteristics , followed by South African English and the English of southeastern England , all of which have similarly non-rhotic accents , aside from some accents in the South Island of New Zealand . Australian and New Zealand English stand out for their innovative vowels : many short vowels are fronted or raised , whereas many long vowels have diphthongised . Australian English also has a contrast between long and short vowels , not found in most other varieties . Australian English grammar aligns closely to British and American English ; like American English , collective plural subjects take on a singular verb ( as in the government is rather than are ) . New Zealand English uses front vowels that are often even higher than in Australian English .
