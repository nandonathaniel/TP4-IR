One such frame of reference is the Hubble flow , the apparent motions of galaxy clusters due to the expansion of space . Individual galaxies , including the Milky Way , have peculiar velocities relative to the average flow . Thus , to compare the Milky Way to the Hubble flow , one must consider a volume large enough so that the expansion of the Universe dominates over local , random motions . A large enough volume means that the mean motion of galaxies within this volume is equal to the Hubble flow . Astronomers believe the Milky Way is moving at approximately 630 km / s ( 1,400,000 mph ) with respect to this local co-moving frame of reference . The Milky Way is moving in the general direction of the Great Attractor and other galaxy clusters , including the Shapley supercluster , behind it . The Local Group ( a cluster of gravitationally bound galaxies containing , among others , the Milky Way and the Andromeda Galaxy ) is part of a supercluster called the Local Supercluster , centered near the Virgo Cluster : although they are moving away from each other at 967 km / s ( 2,160,000 mph ) as part of the Hubble flow , this velocity is less than would be expected given the 16.8 million pc distance due to the gravitational attraction between the Local Group and the Virgo Cluster .
