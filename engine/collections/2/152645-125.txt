In Illinois , the word `` town '' has been used both to denote a subdivision of a county called a township , and to denote a form of municipality similar to a village , in that it is generally governed by a president and trustees rather than a mayor . In some areas a `` Town '' may be incorporated legally as a Village ( meaning it has at large Trustees ) or a City ( meaning it has aldermen from districts ) and absorb the duties of the Township it is coterminous with ( maintenance of birth records , certain welfare items ) . Evanston , Berwyn and Cicero are examples of Towns in this manner . Under the current Illinois Municipal Code , an incorporated or unincorporated town may choose to incorporate as a city or as a village , but other forms of incorporation are no longer allowed .
