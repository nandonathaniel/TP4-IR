The permanganate - bisulfite - toluidine blue reaction is a highly selective and sensitive method for demonstrating elastic fibers under polarizing optics . The induced birefringence demonstrates the highly ordered molecular structure of the elastin molecules in the elastic fiber . This is not readily apparent under normal optics .
