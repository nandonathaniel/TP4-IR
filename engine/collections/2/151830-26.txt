When the case was appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit , the case was heard en banc by six of the seven judges sat on the court . The seventh judge Judge J. Braxton Craven , recused himself due to him being the original trial court judge . The opinion was 3 - 2 - 1 that the restructured busing orders should be affirmed for older students , but that it be remanded for those of elementary school age . Two dissenters would have affirmed the whole decision , while one would reverse McMillan 's ruling in its entirety . McMillan decided to follow his original plan for elementary school students after the case was remanded to him .
