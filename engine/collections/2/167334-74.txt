City officials in Montgomery and Detroit announced on October 27 , 2005 , that the front seats of their city buses would be reserved with black ribbons in honor of Parks until her funeral . Parks ' coffin was flown to Montgomery and taken in a horse - drawn hearse to the St. Paul African Methodist Episcopal ( AME ) church , where she lay in repose at the altar on October 29 , 2005 , dressed in the uniform of a church deaconess . A memorial service was held there the following morning . One of the speakers , United States Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice , said that if it had not been for Parks , she would probably have never become the Secretary of State . In the evening the casket was transported to Washington , D.C. and transported by a bus similar to the one in which she made her protest , to lie in honor in the rotunda of the U.S. Capitol .
