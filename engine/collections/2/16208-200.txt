In 2008 , Bloomberg claimed child labour in copper and cobalt mines that supplied Chinese companies in Congo . The children are creuseurs , that is they dig the ore by hand , carry sacks of ores on their backs , and these are then purchased by these companies . Over 60 of Katanga 's 75 processing plants are owned by Chinese companies and 90 percent of the region 's minerals go to China . An African NGO report claimed 80,000 child labourers under the age of 15 , or about 40 % of all miners , were supplying ore to Chinese companies in this African region . Amnesty International alleged in 2016 that some cobalt sold by Congo Dongfang Mining was produced by child labour , and that it was being used in lithium - ion batteries powering electric cars and mobile devices worldwide .
