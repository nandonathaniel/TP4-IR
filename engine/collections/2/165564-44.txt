The Games have also had significant negative effects on host communities ; for example , the Centre on Housing Rights and Evictions reports that the Olympics displaced more than two million people over two decades , often disproportionately affecting disadvantaged groups . The 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi were the most expensive Olympic Games in history , costing in excess of US $50 billion . According to a report by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development that was released at the time of the games , this cost will not boost Russia 's national economy , but may attract business to Sochi and the southern Krasnodar region of Russia in the future as a result of improved services . But by December 2014 , The Guardian stated that Sochi `` now feels like a ghost town '' , citing the spread - out nature of the stadiums and arenas , the still - unfinished construction , and the overall effects of Russia 's political and economic turmoil . Furthermore , at least four cities withdrew their bids for the 2022 Winter Olympics , citing the high costs or the lack of local support , resulting in only a two - city race between Almaty , Kazakhstan and Beijing , China . Thus in July 2016 , The Guardian stated that the biggest threat to the future of the Olympics is that very few cities want to host them . Bidding for the 2024 Summer Olympics also became a two - city race between Paris and Los Angeles , so the IOC took the unusual step of simultaneously awarding both the 2024 Games to Paris and the 2028 Games to Los Angeles .
