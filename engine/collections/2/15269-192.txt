The competition with Philadelphia has been particularly intense since the late 1970s , when the long - moribund Eagles returned to contention . In January 1981 , the two teams faced off in the NFC Championship , with Philadelphia winning 20 -- 7 . A series of other factors heightened tensions during the 1980s and 1990s , including several provocative actions by Philadelphia fans and Eagles head coach Buddy Ryan . Among these were the 1989 `` Bounty Bowls '' , in which Ryan allegedly placed a bounty on Dallas kicker Luis Zendejas and Veterans Stadium fans pelted the Cowboys with snowballs and other debris . A 1999 game at Philadelphia saw Eagles fans cheering as Michael Irvin lay motionless and possibly paralyzed on the field . In 2008 the rivalry became more intense when in the last game of the year in which both teams could clinch a playoff spot with a victory , the Philadelphia Eagles defeated the Cowboys 44 -- 6 . The following season , the Cowboys avenged that defeat by beating the Eagles three times : twice during the regular season to claim the title as NFC East champions and once more in a wild - card playoff game by a combined score of 78 -- 30 , including a 24 -- 0 shutout in week 17 . That three game sweep was Dallas ' first over any opponent and the longest winning streak against the Eagles since 1992 -- 1995 when Dallas won seven straight matches against Philadelphia . During the 2013 season Dallas won the first meeting 17 -- 3 at Lincoln Financial Field in Philadelphia . They would meet again in Week 17 at AT&T Stadium with the winner clinching the 2013 NFC East title . The Cowboys came into the game at a disadvantage with starting quarterback Tony Romo out with a season ending back injury which put backup Kyle Orton as the starter . It was a tight game with the Eagles up 24 -- 22 with less than 2 minutes to go in regulation . Orton got the ball and started driving down the field when he was intercepted by the Eagles defense , which ended the game and the Cowboys season . In 2014 , the Cowboys and Eagles both won against each other on the road , with Philadelphia posting a dominant 33 -- 10 win on Thanksgiving Day in Dallas , and Dallas returning the favor two weeks later by defeating the Eagles 38 -- 27 in Philadelphia . The second game between these rivals clenched a playoff spot for Dallas and led to formerly first place Philadelphia missing out on the post-season . Dallas leads the regular season all - time series 63 -- 50 .
