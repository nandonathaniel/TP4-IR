If both partners are young and healthy and have been trying to conceive for one year without success , a visit to a physician or women 's health nurse practitioner ( WHNP ) could help to highlight potential medical problems earlier rather than later . The doctor or WHNP may also be able to suggest lifestyle changes to increase the chances of conceiving .
