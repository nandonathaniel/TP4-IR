A few years later , in 474 , Syracuse 's tyrant Hiero defeated the Etruscans at the Battle of Cumae . Etruria 's influence over the cities of Latium and Campania weakened , and it was taken over by Romans and Samnites . In the 4th century , Etruria saw a Gallic invasion end its influence over the Po valley and the Adriatic coast . Meanwhile , Rome had started annexing Etruscan cities . This led to the loss of their north provinces . Etruscia was assimilated by Rome around 500 BCE .
