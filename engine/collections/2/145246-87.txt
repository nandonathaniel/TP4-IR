Paramount released a featurette of Mamoru Oshii ( director of the 1995 and 2004 original anime films ) visiting the studio , in which he says that Johansson exceeded his expectations for the role . Oshii told IGN that as the Major uses an assumed body and name , there was no basis for saying an Asian woman must portray her , and stated : `` I can only sense a political motive from the people opposing it , and I believe artistic expression must be free from politics . '' During a launch event in Tokyo , director Rupert Sanders said of Johansson : `` There are very few actresses with 20 years ' experience who have the cyberpunk ethic already baked in . I stand by my decision -- she 's the best actress of her generation . '' Addressing the controversy , producer Steven Paul referred to the film 's setting as `` an international world '' with characters of numerous nationalities .
