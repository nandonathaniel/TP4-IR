Soma is a seventeen - year - old Indian prince , and the twenty - sixth child of the Raja of Bengal . Unlike Ciel , he is spoiled and uses his parents ' fortune for his personal needs and blames all of his problems on others . During the course of his time in England , Soma begins to mature , although he still possesses childish traits . After learning that his servant Mina hated him for his ignorance and self - absorbed personality , Soma decided to stay with Ciel and learn how to act as a gentleman and even proclaims to be Ciel 's best friend . Shortly after , Ciel has him and Agni manage his townhouse in London , but they occasionally return to the Phantomhive manor for visits . Soma is constantly worrying about Ciel and becomes very pleased whenever he can be of assistance to him . Soma is frequently frightened by Sebastian , as he hides behind others whenever he is speaking to him . He is voiced by Shinnosuke Tachibana in Japanese and Christopher Ayres in the English dub .
