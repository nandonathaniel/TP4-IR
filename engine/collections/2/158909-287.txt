Some accounts argue that Truman had appointed Biddle as the main American judge for the trial as an apology for asking for his resignation . Ironically , Biddle was known during his time as Attorney General for opposing the idea of prosecuting Nazi leaders for crimes committed before the beginning of the war , even sending out a memorandum on 5 January 1945 on the subject . The note also expressed Biddle 's opinion that instead of proceeding with the original plan for prosecuting entire organizations , there should simply be more trials that would prosecute specific offenders .
