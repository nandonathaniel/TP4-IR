In the 1st century BC , Romans started to use concrete widely . Concrete was invented in the late 3rd century BC . It was a powerful cement derived from pozzolana , and soon supplanted marble as the chief Roman building material and allowed many daring architectural forms . Also in the 1st century BC , Vitruvius wrote De architectura , possibly the first complete treatise on architecture in history . In the late 1st century BC , Rome also began to use glassblowing soon after its invention in Syria about 50 BC . Mosaics took the Empire by storm after samples were retrieved during Lucius Cornelius Sulla 's campaigns in Greece .
