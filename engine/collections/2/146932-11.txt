In a 2004 episode of The Simpsons ( `` Catch ' Em If You Can '' ) , the Simpson family watches the film , and Lisa retorts , `` No it does n't ! '' The line has also been parodied countless times , usually substituting another word or phrase for `` love '' and / or `` you 're sorry , '' especially the latter . The quote is also shown in TV series Love Rain .
