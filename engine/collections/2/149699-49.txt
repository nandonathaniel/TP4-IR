In 1950 , Jaguar agreed to lease from the Ministry of Supply the Daimler Shadow 2 factory in Browns Lane , Allesley , Coventry , which at the time was being used by The Daimler Company Limited and moved to the new site from Foleshill over the next 12 months . Jaguar purchased Daimler -- not to be confused with Daimler - Benz or Daimler AG -- in 1960 from BSA . From the late 1960s , Jaguar used the Daimler marque as a brand name for their most luxurious saloons .
