Wolfdogs are a mixture of genetic traits , which results in less predictable behavior patterns compared to either the wolf or dog . The adult behavior of wolfdog pups also can not be predicted with comparable certainty to dog pups , even in third - generation pups produced by wolfdog mating with dogs or from the behavior of the parent animals . Thus , though the behavior of a single individual wolfdogs may be predictable , the behavior of the type as a whole is not . The majority of high wolf - content wolfdogs are very curious and are generally no more destructive than any other curious or active dogs .
