Although grizzlies are of the order Carnivora and have the digestive system of carnivores , they are normally omnivores : their diets consist of both plants and animals . They have been known to prey on large mammals , when available , such as moose , elk , caribou , white - tailed deer , mule deer , bighorn sheep , bison , and even black bears ; though they are more likely to take calves and injured individuals rather than healthy adults . Grizzly bears feed on fish such as salmon , trout , and bass , and those with access to a more protein - enriched diet in coastal areas potentially grow larger than inland individuals . Grizzly bears also readily scavenge food or carrion left behind by other animals . Grizzly bears will also eat birds and their eggs , and gather in large numbers at fishing sites to feed on spawning salmon . They frequently prey on baby deer left in the grass , and occasionally they raid the nests of raptors such as bald eagles .
