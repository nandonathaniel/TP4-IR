There were few executions in Britain in 1932 , and the first execution Pierrepoint attended was in Mountjoy Prison , Dublin , on 29 December 1932 , when his uncle Thomas was chief executioner at the hanging of Patrick McDermott , a young Irish farmer who had murdered his brother . Thomas engaged his nephew as assistant executioner , even though Pierrepoint had not yet observed a hanging in England and thus , despite being on the Home Office list of approved Assistant Executioners , was not allowed to officiate in England . Pierrepoint 's first execution after his promotion ( although he still acted as assistant until 1945 at Shepton Mallet ) was that of nightclub owner and gangster Antonio `` Babe '' Mancini , at Pentonville Prison on 17 October 1941 ; Mancini said `` Cheerio ! '' before the trapdoor was sprung .
