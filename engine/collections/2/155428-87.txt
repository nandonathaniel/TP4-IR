France provided weapons , mercenary fighters , and other assistance to Biafra and promoted its cause internationally , describing the situation as a genocide . Charles de Gaulle referred to `` Biafra 's just and noble cause '' . However , France did not recognise Biafra diplomatically . Through Pierre Laureys , France had apparently provided two B - 26s , Alouette helicopters , and pilots . France supplied Biafra with captured German and Italian weapons from World War II , sans serial numbers , delivered as part of regular shipments to CÃ´te d'Ivoire . France also sold Panhard armoured vehicles to the Nigerian federal government .
