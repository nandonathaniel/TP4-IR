While they were away , Memnon of Ethiopia , son of Tithonus and Eos , came with his host to help his stepbrother Priam . He did not come directly from Ethiopia , but either from Susa in Persia , conquering all the peoples in between , or from the Caucasus , leading an army of Ethiopians and Indians . Like Achilles , he wore armour made by Hephaestus . In the ensuing battle , Memnon killed Antilochus , who took one of Memnon 's blows to save his father Nestor . Achilles and Memnon then fought . Zeus weighed the fate of the two heroes ; the weight containing that of Memnon sank , and he was slain by Achilles . Achilles chased the Trojans to their city , which he entered . The gods , seeing that he had killed too many of their children , decided that it was his time to die . He was killed after Paris shot a poisoned arrow that was guided by Apollo . In another version he was killed by a knife to the back ( or heel ) by Paris , while marrying Polyxena , daughter of Priam , in the temple of Thymbraean Apollo , the site where he had earlier killed Troilus . Both versions conspicuously deny the killer any sort of valour , saying Achilles remained undefeated on the battlefield . His bones were mingled with those of Patroclus , and funeral games were held . Like Ajax , he is represented as living after his death in the island of Leuke , at the mouth of the Danube River , where he is married to Helen .
