By contrast , the Habsburg frontier had settled somewhat , a stalemate caused by a stiffening of the Habsburg defences . The Long War against Habsburg Austria ( 1593 -- 1606 ) created the need for greater numbers of Ottoman infantry equipped with firearms , resulting in a relaxation of recruitment policy . This contributed to problems of indiscipline and outright rebelliousness within the corps , which were never fully solved . Irregular sharpshooters ( Sekban ) were also recruited , and on demobilization turned to brigandage in the Jelali revolts ( 1590 -- 1610 ) , which engendered widespread anarchy in Anatolia in the late 16th and early 17th centuries . With the Empire 's population reaching 30 million people by 1600 , the shortage of land placed further pressure on the government . In spite of these problems , the Ottoman state remained strong , and its army did not collapse or suffer crushing defeats . The only exceptions were campaigns against the Safavid dynasty of Persia , where many of the Ottoman eastern provinces were lost , some permanently . This 1603 -- 1618 war eventually resulted in the Treaty of Nasuh Pasha , which ceded the entire Caucasus , except westernmost Georgia , back into Iranian Safavid possession .
