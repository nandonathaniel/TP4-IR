It is important to note that x ≦ y remains true if every element is equal . However , if the operator is changed , x ≤ y is true if and only if x ≠ y is also true . ≺ ≻ ≺ ( \ displaystyle \ prec ) ≻ ( \ displaystyle \ succ ) \ prec \ succ Karp reduction is Karp reducible to ; is polynomial - time many - one reducible to computational complexity theory L ≺ L means that the problem L is Karp reducible to L .
