In ancient Rome , marriage was often regarded more as a financial and political alliance than as a romantic association , especially in the upper classes ( see marriage in ancient Rome ) . Fathers usually began seeking husbands for their daughters when these reached an age between twelve and fourteen . The husband was usually older than the bride . While upper class girls married very young , there is evidence that lower class women often married in their late teens or early 20s .
