Inhabited by Kalinago people since the 13th century , and prior to that by other Amerindians , Barbados was visited by Spanish navigators in the late 15th century and claimed for the Spanish Crown . It first appeared in a Spanish map in 1511 . The Portuguese visited the island in 1536 , but they left it unclaimed , with their only remnants being an introduction of wild hogs for a good supply of meat whenever the island was visited . An English ship , the Olive Blossom , arrived in Barbados in 1625 ; its men took possession of it in the name of King James I. In 1627 , the first permanent settlers arrived from England , and it became an English and later British colony . As a wealthy sugar colony , it became an English centre of the African slave trade until that trade was outlawed in 1807 , with final emancipation of slaves in Barbados occurring over a period of years from 1833 .
