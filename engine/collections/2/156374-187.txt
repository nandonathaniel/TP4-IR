Robert N. Bellah has argued in his writings that although the separation of church and state is grounded firmly in the constitution of the United States , this does not mean that there is no religious dimension in the political society of the United States . He used the term Civil Religion to describe the specific relation between politics and religion in the United States . His 1967 article analyzes the inaugural speech of John F. Kennedy : `` Considering the separation of church and state , how is a president justified in using the word ' God ' at all ? The answer is that the separation of church and state has not denied the political realm a religious dimension . ''
