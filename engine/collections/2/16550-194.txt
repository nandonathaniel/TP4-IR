In January 1946 the Allied Control Council set the foundation of the future German economy by putting a cap on German steel production . The maximum allowed was set at about 5,800,000 tons of steel a year , equivalent to 25 % of the pre-war production level . The UK , in whose occupation zone most of the steel production was located , had argued for a more limited capacity reduction by placing the production ceiling at 12 million tons of steel per year , but had to submit to the will of the US , France and the Soviet Union ( which had argued for a 3 million ton limit ) . Steel plants thus made redundant were to be dismantled . Germany was to be reduced to the standard of life it had known at the height of the Great Depression ( 1932 ) . Consequently , car production was set to 10 % of pre-war levels , and the manufacture of other commodities was reduced as well .
