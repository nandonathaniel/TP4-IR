Prior to breakthrough , only the part of the tunnel - the semicircular cross-section above the bench - was excavated . Excavation of the bench in the southbound tunnel began on 9 July 2008 . This work progressed much quicker than the initial excavation work as several faces could be opened up at once . Again , the primary linings were sprayed onto the workings as digging progressed . The excavation and primary linings were completed on 31 March 2009 with a total of 737,000 cubic metres of spoil having been excavated .
