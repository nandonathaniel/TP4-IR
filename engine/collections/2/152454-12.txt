In 1829 , American William Austin Burt patented a machine called the `` Typographer '' which , in common with many other early machines , is listed as the `` first typewriter '' . The Science Museum ( London ) describes it merely as `` the first writing mechanism whose invention was documented , '' but even that claim may be excessive , since Turri 's invention pre-dates it . Even in the hands of its inventor , this machine was slower than handwriting . Burt and his promoter John D. Sheldon never found a buyer for the patent , so the invention was never commercially produced . Because the typographer used a dial , rather than keys , to select each character , it was called an `` index typewriter '' rather than a `` keyboard typewriter . '' Index typewriters of that era resemble the squeeze - style embosser from the 1960s more than they resemble the modern keyboard typewriter .
