In March 2014 , Brian Tyler signed on to compose the film 's score , replacing the composer for the first film , Alan Silvestri , while also marking his third film collaboration with Marvel following Iron Man 3 and Thor : The Dark World in 2013 . Tyler stated that the score pays homage to John Williams ' scores for Star Wars , Superman , and Raiders of the Lost Ark and references the scores for the Iron Man , Thor , and Captain America films in order to create a similar musical universe , saying , `` That 's the goal for sure . You have to build in nostalgia and do it upfront so you can relate to it . '' Danny Elfman also contributed music to the score , using Silvestri 's theme from the first film to create a new hybrid theme . Hollywood Records released the album digitally on April 28 , 2015 , and in physical formats on May 19 .
