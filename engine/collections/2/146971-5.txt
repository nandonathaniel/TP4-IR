The establishment of the Uniform Penny Post in 1840 , and the extension of the railway network to Newtown , helped to eventually turn his small rural concern into a company with global renown . In 1861 , Pryce - Jones hit upon a unique method of selling his wares . He distributed catalogues of his wares across the country , allowing people to choose the items they wished and order them via post ; he would then dispatch the goods to the customer via the railways . It was an ideal way of meeting the needs of customers in isolated rural locations who were either too busy or unable to get into Newtown to shop directly . This was the world 's first mail order business , an idea which would change the nature of retail in the coming century .
