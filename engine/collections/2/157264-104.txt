Another distinctive property of glucokinase is its moderate cooperativity with glucose , with a Hill coefficient ( n ) of about 1.7 . Glucokinase has only a single binding site for glucose and is the only monomeric regulatory enzyme known to display substrate cooperativity . The nature of the cooperativity has been postulated to involve a `` slow transition '' between two different enzyme states with different rates of activity . If the dominant state depends upon glucose concentration , it would produce an apparent cooperativity similar to that observed .
