Furthermore , every man is responsible for his own faith , and he must see it for himself that he believes rightly . As little as another can go to hell or heaven for me , so little can he believe or disbelieve for me ; and as little as he can open or shut heaven or hell for me , so little can he drive me to faith or unbelief . Since , then , belief or unbelief is a matter of every one 's conscience , and since this is no lessening of the secular power , the latter should be content and attend to its own affairs and permit men to believe one thing or another , as they are able and willing , and constrain no one by force .
