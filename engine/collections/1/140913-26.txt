Jennifer Schuessler , writing in the New York Times , notes that Alexander presents voluminous evidence in the form of both statistics and legal cases to argue that the tough - on - crime policies begun under the Nixon administration and amplified under Reagan 's war on drugs have devastated black America , where nearly one - third of black men are likely to spend time in prison during their lifetimes , and where many of these men will be second - class citizens afterwards . Schuessler also notes that Alexander 's book goes further , by asserting that the increase in incarceration was a deliberate effort to roll back civil rights gains , rather than a true response to increased rates of violent crime . Schuessler notes that the book has galvanized both black and white readers , some of whom view the work as giving voice to deep feelings that the criminal justice system is stacked against blacks , while others might question its portrayal of anti-crime policies as primarily motivated by racial animus .
