The two consuls were a part of the senate , but had more power than the senators . During senate meetings , the emperor sat between the two consuls , and usually acted as the presiding officer . Senators of the early empire could ask extraneous questions or request that a certain action be taken by the senate . Higher ranking senators spoke before those of lower rank , although the emperor could speak at any time .
