Johnny Cash -- who became known as `` The Man in Black '' -- became one of the most influential musicians of the 1960s ( and eventually , 20th century ) . Although primarily recording country , his songs and sound spanned many other genres including rockabilly , blues , folk and gospel . His music showed great compassion for minorities and others who were shunned by society , including prison inmates . Two of Cash 's most successful albums were recorded live in prison : At Folsom Prison and At San Quentin .
