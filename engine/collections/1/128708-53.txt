Bon Iver 's `` Perth '' was inspired by Heath Ledger . Justin Vernon , the lead singer and songwriter of the American indie folk band , revealed back in 2011 that he had begun working on the song in 2008 and was scheduled to meet with a music video director who was good friends with Ledger , Matt Amato . `` The first thing I worked on , the riff and the beginning melodies , was the first song on the record , ' Perth , ' '' Vernon told Exclaim ! . Amato was directing the band 's `` The Wolves ( Act I & II ) '' music video the day that Ledger died . `` It was no longer about just making a Bon Iver music video anymore , '' Vernon says . `` This was now our chance to be there with Matt as he grieved . It was a three - day wake . '' Amato told Vernon stories about Ledger that eventually became the inspiration for `` Perth , '' the opening track to the band 's second studio album Bon Iver , Bon Iver ( 2011 ) .
