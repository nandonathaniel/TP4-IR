A PPF ( production possibility frontier ) typically takes the form of the curve illustrated above . An economy that is operating on the PPF is said to be efficient , meaning that it would be impossible to produce more of one good without decreasing production of the other good . In contrast , if the economy is operating below the curve , it is said to be operating inefficiently because it could reallocate resources in order to produce more of both goods or some resources such as labor or capital are sitting idle and could be fully employed to produce more of both goods .
