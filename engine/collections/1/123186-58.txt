Steve Kloves was selected to write the screenplay . He described adapting the book as `` tough '' , as it did not `` lend itself to adaptation as well as the next two books . '' Kloves often received synopses of books proposed as film adaptations from Warner Bros. , which he `` almost never read '' , but Harry Potter jumped out at him . He went out and bought the book , and became an instant fan of the series . When speaking to Warner Bros. , he stated that the film had to be British , and had to be true to the characters . Kloves was nervous when he first met Rowling as he did not want her to think he was going to `` ( destroy ) her baby . '' Rowling admitted that she `` was really ready to hate this Steve Kloves , '' but recalled her initial meeting with him : `` The first time I met him , he said to me , ' You know who my favourite character is ? ' And I thought , You 're gon na say Ron . I know you 're gon na say Ron . But he said ' Hermione . ' And I just kind of melted . '' Rowling received a large amount of creative control , an arrangement that Columbus did not mind .
