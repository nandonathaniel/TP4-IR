To promote the release of their debut album , Wednesday Morning , 3 A.M. , the duo performed again at Folk City , as well as two shows at the Gaslight Caf√© , which went over poorly . Dave Van Ronk , a folk singer , was at the performances , and noted that several in the audience regarded their music as a joke . `` ' Sounds of Silence ' actually became a running joke : for a while there , it was only necessary to start singing ' Hello darkness , my old friend ... ' and everybody would crack up . '' Wednesday Morning , 3 AM sold only 3,000 copies upon its October release , and its dismal sales led Simon to move to London , England . While there , he recorded a solo album , The Paul Simon Songbook ( 1965 ) , which features a rendition of the song , titled `` The Sounds of Silence '' .
