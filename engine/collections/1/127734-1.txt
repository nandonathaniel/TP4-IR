Many applications of silicate glasses derive from their optical transparency , giving rise to their primary use as window panes . Glass will transmit , reflect and refract light ; these qualities can be enhanced by cutting and polishing to make optical lenses , prisms , fine glassware , and optical fibers for high speed data transmission by light . Glass can be coloured by adding metallic salts , and can also be painted and printed with vitreous enamels . These qualities have led to the extensive use of glass in the manufacture of art objects and in particular , stained glass windows . Although brittle , silicate glass is extremely durable , and many examples of glass fragments exist from early glass - making cultures . Because glass can be formed or moulded into any shape , it has been traditionally used for vessels : bowls , vases , bottles , jars and drinking glasses . In its most solid forms it has also been used for paperweights , marbles , and beads . When extruded as glass fiber and matted as glass wool in a way to trap air , it becomes a thermal insulating material , and when these glass fibers are embedded into an organic polymer plastic , they are a key structural reinforcement part of the composite material fiberglass . Some objects historically were so commonly made of silicate glass that they are simply called by the name of the material , such as drinking glasses and eyeglasses .
