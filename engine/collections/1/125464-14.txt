In 1411 , there was an uprising in Mainz against the patricians , and more than a hundred families were forced to leave . As a result , the Gutenbergs are thought to have moved to Eltville am Rhein ( Alta Villa ) , where his mother had an inherited estate . According to historian Heinrich Wallau , `` All that is known of his youth is that he was not in Mainz in 1430 . It is presumed that he migrated for political reasons to Strasbourg , where the family probably had connections . '' He is assumed to have studied at the University of Erfurt , where there is a record of the enrolment of a student called Johannes de Altavilla in 1418 -- Altavilla is the Latin form of Eltville am Rhein .
