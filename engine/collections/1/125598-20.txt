In case of multiple carbonyl types in one molecule , one can expect the most electrophilic carbonyl carbon to react first . Acyl chlorides and carboxylic anhydrides react fastest , followed by aldehydes and ketones . Esters react much more slowly and amides are almost completely unreactive due to resonance of the amide nitrogen towards the carbonyl group . This reactivity difference allows chemoselectivity when a reactant contains multiple carbonyl groups . An instructive example is found in the last part of the total synthesis of monensin by Kishi in 1979 :
