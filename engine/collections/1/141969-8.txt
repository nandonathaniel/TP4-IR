On 14 May 1607 , the London Company established the Jamestown Settlement about 40 miles inland along the James River , a major tributary of the Chesapeake Bay in present - day Virginia . In 1620 , George Calvert asked King James I for a charter for English Catholics to add the territory of the Plymouth Company . Also in 1609 , a much larger Third Supply mission was organized . A new purpose - built ship named the Sea Venture was rushed into service without the customary sea trials . She became flagship of a fleet of nine ships , with most of the leaders , food , and supplies aboard . Notable persons aboard the Sea Venture included fleet Admiral George Somers , Vice-Admiral Christopher Newport , the new governor for the Virginia Colony Sir Thomas Gates , future author William Strachey , and businessman John Rolfe with his pregnant wife .
