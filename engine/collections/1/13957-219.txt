Governor Lachlan Macquarie arranged for the construction of Sydney Hospital and saw it completed in 1816 . Parts of the facility have been repurposed for use as Parliament House but the hospital itself still operates to this day . The city 's first emergency department was established at Sydney Hospital in 1870 . Demand for emergency medical care increased from 1895 with the introduction of an ambulance service . The Sydney Hospital also housed Australia 's first teaching facility for nurses , the Nightingale Wing , established with the input of Florence Nightingale in 1868 .
