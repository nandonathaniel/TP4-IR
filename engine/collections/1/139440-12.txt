It is essential for lighting users to be aware of the Helmholtz -- Kohlrausch effect when working in theaters or in other venues where lighting is often used . In order to get the greatest effect to illuminate their stage or theater , the lighting users need to understand that color has an effect on brightness . For example , one color may appear brighter than another but really they have the same brightness . On stage , lighting users have the ability to make the colored lights appear much brighter than the white light by adding gels . This occurs even though gels can only absorb some of the light . When lighting a stage , the lighting users tend to choose reds , pinks , and blues because they are highly saturated colors and are really very dim . However , we perceive them as being brighter than the other colors because they are most affected by the Helmholtz -- Kohlrausch effect . We perceive that the color white does not look any brighter to us than individual colors . LED lights are a good example of this .
