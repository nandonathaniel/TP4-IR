The Fitbit Ultra suffered from a small design flaw : the unit had a permanently curved shape in order to clip directly onto any piece of clothing . The plastic used in the unit was not appropriate for the strain experienced at the looped end , and with time would become brittle , and crack . While most users experienced only minor cracking with no effects to the device 's function , in a few cases the cracking led to total failure . Fitbit offered replacement or repair of affected units that were under warranty .
