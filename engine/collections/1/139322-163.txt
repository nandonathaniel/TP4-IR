Central Park 's glaciated rock outcroppings attract climbers , especially boulderers ; Manhattan 's bedrock , a glaciated schist , protrudes from the ground frequently and considerably in some parts of Central Park . The two most renowned spots for boulderers are at Rock and Cat Rock ; others include Dog Rock , Duck Rock , Rock N ' Roll Rock , and Beaver Rock , near the south end of the park .
