It is symmetric around the point x = μ ( \ displaystyle x = \ mu ) , which is at the same time the mode , the median and the mean of the distribution . It is unimodal : its first derivative is positive for x < μ ( \ displaystyle x < \ mu ) , negative for x > μ ( \ displaystyle x > \ mu ) , and zero only at x = μ ( \ displaystyle x = \ mu ) . The area under the curve and over the x ( \ displaystyle x ) - axis is unity . Its density has two inflection points ( where the second derivative of f ( \ displaystyle f ) is zero and changes sign ) , located one standard deviation away from the mean , namely at x = μ − σ ( \ displaystyle x = \ mu - \ sigma ) and x = μ + σ ( \ displaystyle x = \ mu + \ sigma ) . Its density is log - concave . Its density is infinitely differentiable , indeed supersmooth of order 2 . Its second derivative f ′ ′ ( \ displaystyle f ^ ( \ prime \ prime ) ) is equal to its derivative with respect to its variance σ 2 ( \ displaystyle \ sigma ^ ( 2 ) ) .
