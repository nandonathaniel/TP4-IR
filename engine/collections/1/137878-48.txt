Little Richard was allegedly a heavy drinker and cigarette smoker during the mid-1960s . By 1972 , he was using cocaine , developing an addiction to the drug . He later lamented during that period , `` they should have called me Little Cocaine , I was sniffing so much of that stuff ! '' He got addicted to heroin and PCP around that same period . Of his drug experiences , he said `` I lost my reasoning '' . He said of his cocaine addiction that he did whatever he could to use cocaine . Little Richard admitted that his addiction to cocaine and heroin was costing him as much as $1,000 a day . In 1977 , longtime friend Larry Williams once showed up with a gun and threatened to kill Little Richard for failing to pay his drug debt . Little Richard later mentioned that this was the most fearful moment of his life because Williams 's own drug addiction made him wildly unpredictable . Little Richard did , however , also acknowledge that he and Williams were `` very close friends '' and when reminiscing of the drug - fueled clash , he recalled thinking `` I knew he loved me -- I hoped he did . '' Within that same year , Little Richard had several devastating personal experiences , including his brother Tony 's death of a heart attack , the accidental shooting of his nephew that he loved like a son , and the murder of two close personal friends -- one a valet at `` the heroin man 's house . '' The combination of these experiences convinced Little Richard to give up drugs and alcohol , along with rock and roll , and return to the ministry .
