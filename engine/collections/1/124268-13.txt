Confucianist Neo-Confucian orthodoxy , with its emphasis on ritual and propriety , has traditionally looked down upon humour as subversive or unseemly . The Confucian `` Analects '' itself , however , depicts the Master as fond of humorous self - deprecation , once comparing his wanderings to the existence of a homeless dog . Early Daoist philosophical texts such as `` Zhuangzi '' pointedly make fun of Confucian seriousness and make Confucius himself a slow - witted figure of fun . Joke books containing a mix of wordplay , puns , situational humour , and play with taboo subjects like sex and scatology , remained popular over the centuries . Local performing arts , storytelling , vernacular fiction , and poetry offer a wide variety of humorous styles and sensibilities .
