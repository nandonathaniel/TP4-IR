The retreat was relatively orderly up to the Bull Run crossings , but it was poorly managed by the Union officers . A Union wagon was overturned by artillery fire on a bridge spanning Cub Run Creek and incited panic in McDowell 's force . As the soldiers streamed uncontrollably toward Centreville , discarding their arms and equipment , McDowell ordered Col. Dixon S. Miles 's division to act as a rear guard , but it was impossible to rally the army short of Washington . In the disorder that followed , hundreds of Union troops were taken prisoner . Wagons and artillery were abandoned , including the 30 - pounder Parrott rifle , which had opened the battle with such fanfare . Expecting an easy Union victory , the wealthy elite of nearby Washington , including congressmen and their families , had come to picnic and watch the battle . When the Union army was driven back in a running disorder , the roads back to Washington were blocked by panicked civilians attempting to flee in their carriages .
