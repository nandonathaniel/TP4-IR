The National Network of Perinatal Quality Collaboratives ( NNPQC ) , sponsored by the CDC , supports state - based perinatal quality collaboratives ( PQCs ) in measuring and improving upon health care and health outcomes for mothers and babies . These PQCs have contributed to improvements such as reduction in deliveries before 39 weeks , reductions in healthcare associated blood stream infections , and improvements in the utilization of antenatal corticosteroids .
