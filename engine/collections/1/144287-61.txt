Photosynthesis measurement systems are not designed to directly measure the amount of light absorbed by the leaf . But analysis of chlorophyll - fluorescence , P700 - and P515 - absorbance and gas exchange measurements reveal detailed information about e.g. the photosystems , quantum efficiency and the CO assimilation rates . With some instruments even wavelength - dependency of the photosynthetic efficiency can be analyzed .
