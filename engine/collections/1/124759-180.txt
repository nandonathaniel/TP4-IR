In West Bengal , Holi is known by the name of `` Dol Jatra '' , `` Dol Purnima '' or the `` Swing Festival '' . The festival is celebrated in a dignified manner by placing the icons of Krishna and Radha on a picturesquely decorated palanquin which is then taken round the main streets of the city or the village . On the Dol Purnima day in the early morning , students dress up in saffron - coloured or pure white clothes and wear garlands of fragrant flowers . They sing and dance to the accompaniment of musical instruments , such as the ektara , dubri , and veena . The devotees take turns to swing them while women dance around the swing and sing devotional songs . During these activities , the men keep spraying coloured water and coloured powder , abir , at them .
