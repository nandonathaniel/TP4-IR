Miller claimed , in A note on the historical accuracy of this play , that `` while there were several judges of almost equal authority , I have symbolized them all in Hathorne and Danforth '' . However , this conflates Danforth with the historical and extremely influential figure of William Stoughton , who is not a character and is only briefly mentioned in the play . Both men were subsequent Deputy Governors , but it was Stoughton ( who , alone among the judges , was a bachelor who never married ) who ordered further deliberations after the jury initially acquitted Rebecca Nurse . He refused to ever acknowledge that the trials had been anything other than a success , and was infuriated when Governor Phips ( whose own wife , somehow , had been named as a possible witch ) ended the trials for good and released the prisoners .
