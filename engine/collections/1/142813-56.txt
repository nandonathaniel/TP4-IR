In September it was announced that an 18 - year - old male patient in France with beta - thalassemia major had been successfully treated . Beta - thalassemia major is an inherited blood disease in which beta haemoglobin is missing and patients are dependent on regular lifelong blood transfusions . The technique used a lentiviral vector to transduce the human ÃŸ - globin gene into purified blood and marrow cells obtained from the patient in June 2007 . The patient 's haemoglobin levels were stable at 9 to 10 g / dL . About a third of the hemoglobin contained the form introduced by the viral vector and blood transfusions were not needed . Further clinical trials were planned . Bone marrow transplants are the only cure for thalassemia , but 75 % of patients do not find a matching donor .
