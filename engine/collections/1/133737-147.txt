In Japan people usually use their cash cards ( キャッシュ カード , kyasshu kādo ) , originally intended only for use with cash machines , as debit cards . The debit functionality of these cards is usually referred to as J - Debit ( ジェイ デビット , Jeidebitto ) , and only cash cards from certain banks can be used . A cash card has the same size as a Visa / MasterCard . As identification , the user will have to enter his or her four - digit PIN when paying . J - Debit was started in Japan on March 6 , 2000 . However , J - Debit has not been that popular since then .
