1748 : Lewis Paul invented the hand driven carding machine . A coat of wire slips were placed around a card which was then wrapped around a cylinder . Lewis 's invention was later developed and improved by Richard Arkwright and Samuel Crompton , although this came about under great suspicion after a fire at Daniel Bourn 's factory in Leominster which specifically used Paul and Wyatt 's spindles . Bourn produced a similar patent in the same year .
