Members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter - day Saints ( also known as Mormons or Latter - day Saints ) believe that after Adam and Eve were expelled from the Garden of Eden they resided in a place known as Adam - ondi - Ahman , located in present - day Daviess County , Missouri . It is recorded in the Doctrine and Covenants that Adam blessed his posterity there and that he will return to that place at the time of the final judgement in fulfillment of biblical prophecy .
