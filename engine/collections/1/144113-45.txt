The Communications Act of 1934 refined and expanded on the authority of the FCC to regulate public airwaves in the United States , combining and reorganizing provisions from the Federal Radio Act of 1927 and the Mann - Elkins Act of 1910 . It empowered the FCC , among other things , to administer broadcasting licenses , impose penalties and regulate standards and equipment used on the airwaves . The Act also mandated that the FCC would act in the interest of the `` public convenience , interest , or necessity . '' The Act established a system whereby the FCC grants licenses to the spectrum to broadcasters for commercial use , so long as the broadcasters act in the public interest by providing news programming .
