If the contestant has the Million Dollar Wedge , the $100,000 envelope is replaced with a $1,000,000 envelope . The $1,000,000 prize has been awarded three times : to Michelle Loewenstein ( on the episode that aired October 14 , 2008 ) , to Autumn Erhard ( May 30 , 2013 ) , and to Sarah Manchester ( September 17 , 2014 ) . Contestants who win the $1,000,000 may receive it in installments over 20 years , or in a lump sum of that amount 's present value . When the contestant fails to land on the $1,000,000 wedge , Sajak will reveal where it was on the prize wheel .
