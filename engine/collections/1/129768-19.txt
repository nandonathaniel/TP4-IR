Although lander missions have twice occurred in pairs , no effort was made to synchronize the sol counts of the two landers within each pair . Thus , for example , although Spirit and Opportunity were sent to operate simultaneously on Mars , each counted its landing date as `` Sol 1 '' , putting their calendars approximately 21 sols out of sync . Spirit and Opportunity differ in longitude by 179 degrees , so when it is daylight for one it is night for the other , and they carried out activities independently while both were operational .
