The newer Lionsgate remastered sets all contain English , French , and Spanish audio as well as English subtitles . They do not include the special features present on the earlier non-remastered releases , but rather seasons 1 through 6 each contain a roughly 15 minute segment of a special called `` The Little House Phenomenon '' . Season 1 also contains the original Pilot movie . Season 7 contains no special features . Seasons 8 & 9 contain the three post-series movie specials as extras , with `` Look Back to Yesterday '' and `` The Last Farewell '' appearing on Season 8 , and `` Bless All The Dear Children '' appearing on Season 9 . Some fans of the show have been perplexed as to why Lionsgate did this , both because all of the movies take place after the Season 9 timeline , and also because they included `` The Last Farewell '' on Season 8 when that is considered by fans to be the end to the show given its significant and memorable ending . Lionsgate 's decision as to which movies to include on which season appears to have been based on broadcast order rather than production order , since `` Bless All The Dear Children '' was the last episode broadcast even though `` The Last Farewell '' was the last one produced . None of the available releases of the series contain `` Little House Years '' , which was a three - hour Thanksgiving special aired during Season 6 that largely consisted of flashback clips .
