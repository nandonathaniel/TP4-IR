The outcome of World War I was disastrous for both the German Reich and the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic . During the war , the Bolsheviks struggled for survival , and Vladimir Lenin recognised the independence of Finland , Estonia , Latvia , Lithuania and Poland . Moreover , facing a German military advance , Lenin and Trotsky were forced to enter into the Treaty of Brest - Litovsk , which ceded massive western Russian territories to the German Empire . After Germany 's collapse , a multinational Allied - led army intervened in the Russian Civil War ( 1917 -- 22 ) .
