Executions at Sing Sing were traditionally carried out at 11 p.m. on Thursdays . Condemned prisoners would be brought into the execution room escorted by seven guards and the prison chaplain . Already waiting in the room would be the warden of Sing Sing , the state electrician , two doctors and twelve state appointed witnesses . After the condemned prisoner was strapped into the chair and the electrodes attached , the warden would step forward and read out the final decision on the sentence . The prisoner would be asked for any last words or for a benediction . With a signal , the execution would then begin . Witnesses would leave once both doctors had confirmed that death had occurred .
