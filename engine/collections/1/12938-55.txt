If the ears are located at the side of the head , similar lateral localization cues as for the human auditory system can be used . This means : evaluation of interaural time differences ( interaural phase differences ) for lower frequencies and evaluation of interaural level differences for higher frequencies . The evaluation of interaural phase differences is useful , as long as it gives unambiguous results . This is the case , as long as ear distance is smaller than half the length ( maximal one wavelength ) of the sound waves . For animals with a larger head than humans the evaluation range for interaural phase differences is shifted towards lower frequencies , for animals with a smaller head , this range is shifted towards higher frequencies .
