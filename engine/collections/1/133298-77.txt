At the 2003 General Synod , the United Church of Christ began a campaign with `` emphasis on expanding the UCC 's name - brand identity through modern advertising and marketing . '' Formally launched during the advent season in 2004 , the campaign included coordinated program of evangelism and hospitality training for congregations paired with national and local television `` brand '' advertising , known as the `` God is Still Speaking '' campaign or `` The Stillspeaking Initiative . '' The initiative was themed around the quotation `` Never place a period where God has placed a comma , '' and campaign materials , including print and broadcast advertising as well as merchandise , featured the quote and a large `` comma , '' with a visual theme in red and black . United Church of Christ congregations were asked to opt into the campaign , signifying their support as well as their willingness to receive training on hospitality and evangelism . An evangelism event was held in Atlanta in August 2005 to promote the campaign . Several renewal groups panned the ad campaign for its efforts to create an ONA / progressive perception of the UCC identity despite its actual majority in centrist / moderate viewpoints . According to John Evans , associate professor of sociology at University of California , San Diego , `` The UCC is clearly going after a certain niche in American society who are very progressive and have a particular religious vision that includes inclusiveness ... They are becoming the religious brand that is known for this . ''
