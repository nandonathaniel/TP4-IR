SR 1 has become famous worldwide , but the highway was signed as several other routes prior to 1964 . When the road was first envisioned in the World War I era , California highways were referred to by either a highway name or a route number . The route numbers were used by state highway planners and the Legislature from 1915 until 1964 , but were never posted on highways , referred to by the auto clubs or public , nor used on maps . The SR 1 designation was first assigned in 1939 . Various portions of SR 1 have been posted and referred to by various names and numbers over the years . State construction of what became SR 1 started after the state 's third highway bond issue passed before 1910 .
