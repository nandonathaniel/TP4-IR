The three major rules of play in ice hockey that limit the movement of the puck : `` offside '' , `` icing '' , and the puck going out of play . A player is `` offside '' if he enters his opponent 's zone before the puck itself . Under many situations , a player may not `` ice the puck '' , shoot the puck all the way across both the centre line and the opponent 's goal line . The puck goes `` out of play '' whenever it goes past the perimeter of the ice rink ( onto the player benches , over the `` glass , '' or onto the protective netting above the glass ) and a stoppage of play is called by the officials using whistles . It also does not matter if the puck comes back onto the ice surface from those areas as the puck is considered dead once it leaves the perimeter of the rink .
