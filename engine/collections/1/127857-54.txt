Originally , the 12 July commemoration was that of the Battle of Aughrim , symbolising Irish Protestants ' victory in the Williamite war in Ireland . At Aughrim , which took place a year after the Boyne , the Jacobite army was destroyed , deciding the war in the Williamites ' favour . The Boyne , which , in the old Julian calendar , took place on 1 July O.S. , was treated as less important , third after Aughrim and the anniversary of the Irish Rebellion of 1641 on 23 October O.S.
