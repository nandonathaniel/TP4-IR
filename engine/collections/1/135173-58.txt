The three towers of the cantilever are each seated on four circular piers . Since the foundations were required to be constructed at or below sea level , they were excavated with the assistance of caissons and cofferdams . Caissons were used at locations that were either always under water , even at low tide , or where the foundations were to be built on mud and clay . Cofferdams were used where rock was nearer to the surface , and it was possible to work in low tide .
