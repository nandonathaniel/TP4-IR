Haunt appears on creatures , instants , and sorceries . When a creature or spell with haunt would be put into a graveyard from the battlefield , instead it is exiled `` haunting '' a creature . Haunt allows a player to use an effect twice : once when the spell is played ( or the creature enters the battlefield ) , and once when the creature it haunts is put into a graveyard . Haunt appears in Guildpact and is the ability associated with the Orzhov Syndicate .
