As an American icon , the Statue of Liberty has been depicted on the country 's coinage and stamps . It appeared on commemorative coins issued to mark its 1986 centennial , and on New York 's 2001 entry in the state quarters series . An image of the statue was chosen for the American Eagle platinum bullion coins in 1997 , and it was placed on the reverse , or tails , side of the Presidential Dollar series of circulating coins . Two images of the statue 's torch appear on the current ten - dollar bill . The statue 's intended photographic depiction on a 2010 forever stamp proved instead to be of the replica at the Las Vegas casino .
