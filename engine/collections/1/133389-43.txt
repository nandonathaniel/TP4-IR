Approximately 3 million cell clusters called pancreatic islets are present in the pancreas . Within these islets are four types of cells which are involved in the regulation of blood glucose levels . Each type of cell secretes a different type of hormone : α alpha cells secrete glucagon ( increase glucose in blood ) , β beta cells secrete insulin ( decrease glucose in blood ) , δ delta cells secrete somatostatin ( regulates / stops α and β cells ) and PP cells , or γ ( gamma ) cells , secrete pancreatic polypeptide . These act to control blood glucose through secreting glucagon to increase the levels of glucose , and insulin to decrease it .
