The new party invented some of the campaign and organizational techniques which were later adopted by the Federalists and became standard American practice . It was especially effective in building a network of newspapers in major cities to broadcast its statements and editorialize its policies . Fisher Ames , a leading Federalist , used the term `` Jacobin '' to link members of Jefferson 's party to the radicals of the French Revolution . He blamed the newspapers for electing Jefferson and wrote they were `` an overmatch for any Government ... The Jacobins owe their triumph to the unceasing use of this engine ; not so much to skill in use of it as by repetition '' .
