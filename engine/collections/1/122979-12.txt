This article is concerned with the terms and concept as used in and applied to the visual arts , although other fields such as aural - music and written word - literature have similar issues and philosophies . The term objet d'art is reserved to describe works of art that are not paintings , prints , drawings or large or medium - sized sculptures , or architecture ( e.g. household goods , figurines , etc. , some purely aesthetic , some also practical ) . The term oeuvre is used to describe the complete body of work completed by an artist throughout a career .
