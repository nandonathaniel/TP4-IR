UNFPA states that , `` Poorer women and those in rural areas often have less access to family planning services . Certain groups -- including adolescents , unmarried people , the urban poor , rural populations , sex workers and people living with HIV also face a variety of barriers to family planning . This can lead to higher rates of unintended pregnancy , increased risk of HIV and other STIs , limited choice of contraceptive methods , and higher levels of unmet need for family planning . ''
