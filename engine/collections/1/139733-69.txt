Congress has the power to overturn an executive order by passing legislation that invalidates it . Congress can also refuse to provide funding necessary to carry out certain policy measures contained with the order or to legitimize policy mechanisms . In the case of the former , the president retains the power to veto such a decision ; however , the Congress may override a veto with a two - thirds majority to end an executive order . It has been argued that a congressional override of an executive order is a nearly impossible event , due to the supermajority vote required and the fact that such a vote leaves individual lawmakers vulnerable to political criticism .
