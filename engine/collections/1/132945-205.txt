Like the way it began , the manner in which World War II ended cast a long shadow over international relations for decades to come . By June 30 , 1946 , there were components for only nine atomic bombs in the US arsenal , all Fat Man devices identical to the one used in the bombing of Nagasaki . The nuclear weapons were handmade devices , and a great deal of work remained to improve their ease of assembly , safety , reliability and storage before they were ready for production . There were also many improvements to their performance that had been suggested or recommended , but that had not been possible under the pressure of wartime development . The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , Fleet Admiral William D. Leahy had decried the use of the atomic bombs as adopting `` an ethical standard common to the barbarians of the Dark Ages '' , but in October 1947 , he reported a military requirement for 400 bombs .
