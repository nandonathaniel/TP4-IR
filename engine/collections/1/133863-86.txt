Falls Park on the Reedy , a large regional park in the West End with gardens and several waterfalls , with access to the Swamp Rabbit Trail . Dedicated in 2004 , the $15.0 million park is home to the Liberty Bridge , a pedestrian suspension bridge overlooking the Reedy River . The park 's development sparked a $75 million public - private development , Riverplace , directly across Main Street . Falls Park has been called the birthplace of Greenville , but in the mid-20th century the area was in severe decline , and the Camperdown Bridge had been built across the Falls , obstructing view . In the mid-1980s , the City adopted a master plan for the park , leading to the removal of the Camperdown Bridge and making way for extensive renovations , to include 20 acres ( 81,000 m ) of gardens and the Liberty Bridge . While bridges with similar structural concepts have been built in Europe , the Liberty Bridge is unique in its geometry .
