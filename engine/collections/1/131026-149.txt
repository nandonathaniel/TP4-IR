At the outbreak of World War I ( 1914 -- 1918 ) , Alfred Marshall was still working on his last revisions of his Principles of Economics . The 20th century 's initial climate of optimism was soon violently dismembered in the trenches of the Western Front . During the war , production in Britain , Germany , and France was switched to the military . In 1917 Russia crumbled into revolution led by Vladimir Lenin and who promoted Marxist theory and collectivized the means of production . Also in 1917 the United States of America entered the war Allies ( France and Britain ) , with President Woodrow Wilson claiming to be `` making the world safe for democracy '' , devising a peace plan of Fourteen Points . In 1918 Germany launched a spring offensive which failed , and as the allies counterattacked and more millions were slaughtered , Germany slid into the German Revolution , its interim government suing for peace on the basis of Wilson 's Fourteen Points . After the war , Europe lay in ruins , financially , physically , psychologically , and its future was dependent on the dictates of the Versailles Conference in 1919 .
