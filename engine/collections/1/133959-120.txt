The Ashanti prepared the fields by burning before the onset of the rainy season and cultivated with an iron hoe . Fields are left fallow for a couple years , usually after two to four years of cultivation . Plants cultivated include plantains , yams , manioc , corn , sweet potatoes , millet , beans , onions , peanuts , tomatoes , and many fruits . Manioc and corn are New World transplants introduced during the Atlantic European trade . Many of these vegetable crops could be harvested twice a year and the cassava ( manioc ) , after a two - year growth , provides a starchy root . The Ashanti transformed palm wine , maize and millet into beer , a favorite drink ; and made use of the oil from palm for many culinary and domestic uses .
