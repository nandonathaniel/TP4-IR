Cement - bound materials come in multiple types . Mass concrete is used where exceptional loads are expected , with thickness usually 100 to 150 millimetres ( 4 to 6 in ) , and optional reinforcement with steel mesh or polymer fibers . Other cement bound materials ( CBM ) , with less strength but also lower cost , are used . They are rated by strength , from the weakest CBM 1 ( also formerly known as soil cement ) through CBM 2 to CBM 3 , 4 , and 5 , which are more similar to concrete and are called `` lean mix '' .
