The 2nd edition product Mind Lords of the Last Sea introduced a new offshoot of Dark Sun elf . The people of Saragar call them `` ghost elves '' for their fair complexions , light blonde hair and pale blue eyes . Ghost elves are elitist and xenophobic , and live almost exclusively in the city of Sylvandretta . To maintain a pure bloodline , they have inbred for millennia , resulting in their lighter appearance and halving their lifespan compared to other Athasian elves .
