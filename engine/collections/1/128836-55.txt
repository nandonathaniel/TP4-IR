Shaykh al - Mufid writes that before the Battle of Karbala , Hussein ibn Ali and the commander of the enemy forces , Umar ibn Saad , met at night and talked together for a long time . After that meeting Umar ibn Saad sent a letter to the Governor of Kufa , Ubayd - Allah ibn Ziyad in which he wrote that Hussein ibn Ali has suggested that he go to ' one of the border outposts ' of the rapidly expanding Muslim empire as a way of resolving conflict . Other traditions name that border outpost as Al Hind or India . Even though Hussein ibn Ali himself was not able to go to India , some of the Shia did emigrate there for various reasons , including those who came as refugees from Umayyads and Abbasids persecution . These refugees brought with them rituals which kept alive the remembrance of Karbala and their Shia Identity .
