In 1415 , Frederick I became the elector of the Margraviate of Brandenburg , which he ruled until 1440 . During the 15th century , his successors established Berlin - Cölln as capital of the margraviate , and subsequent members of the Hohenzollern family ruled in Berlin until 1918 , first as electors of Brandenburg , then as kings of Prussia , and eventually as German emperors . In 1443 , Frederick II Irontooth started the construction of a new royal palace in the twin city Berlin - Cölln . The protests of the town citizens against the building culminated in 1448 , in the `` Berlin Indignation '' ( `` Berliner Unwille '' ) . This protest was not successful and the citizenry lost many of its political and economic privileges . After the royal palace was finished in 1451 , it gradually came into use . From 1470 , with the new elector Albrecht III Achilles , Berlin - Cölln became the new royal residence . Officially , the Berlin - Cölln palace became permanent residence of the Brandenburg electors of the Hohenzollerns from 1486 , when John Cicero came to power . Berlin - Cölln , however , had to give up its status as a free Hanseatic city . In 1539 , the electors and the city officially became Lutheran .
