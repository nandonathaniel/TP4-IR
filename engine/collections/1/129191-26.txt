Synthesis ( S ) phase : The genetic material is replicated ; each of the cell 's chromosomes duplicates to become two identical sister chromatids attached at a centromere . This replication does not change the ploidy of the cell since the centromere number remains the same . The identical sister chromatids have not yet condensed into the densely packaged chromosomes visible with the light microscope . This will take place during prophase I in meiosis .
