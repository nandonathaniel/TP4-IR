From at least the 4th Dynasty of Ancient Egypt , the Sun was worshipped as the god Ra , portrayed as a falcon - headed divinity surmounted by the solar disk , and surrounded by a serpent . In the New Empire period , the Sun became identified with the dung beetle , whose spherical ball of dung was identified with the Sun . In the form of the Sun disc Aten , the Sun had a brief resurgence during the Amarna Period when it again became the preeminent , if not only , divinity for the Pharaoh Akhenaton .
