The scene where Jack writes obsessively on the typewriter `` All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy '' was shot changing the language of the typescript in Italian , French , Spanish , and German , because the film would be dubbed in these languages in their respective countries . In the Italian version , Nicholson was dubbed by Giancarlo Giannini ; Kubrick sent him a congratulations letter for his excellent work as voice actor .
