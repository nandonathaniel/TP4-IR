In plants and other organisms , DNA methylation is found in three different sequence contexts : CG ( or CpG ) , CHG or CHH ( where H correspond to A , T or C ) . In mammals however , DNA methylation is almost exclusively found in CpG dinucleotides , with the cytosines on both strands being usually methylated . Non-CpG methylation can however be observed in embryonic stem cells , and has also been indicated in neural development . Furthermore , non-CpG methylation has also been observed in hematopoietic progenitor cells , and it occurred mainly in a CpApC sequence context .
