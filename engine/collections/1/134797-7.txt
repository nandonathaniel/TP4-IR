Throughout the nineteenth century , nearly all dust jackets were discarded at or soon after purchase . Many were probably discarded in bookstores as the books were put out for display , or when they were sold ; there is evidence that this was common practice in England until World War I . The period from the 1820s to 1900 was a golden age for publishers ' decorative bookbinding , and most dust jackets were much plainer than the books they covered , often simply repeating the main elements of the binding decoration in black on cream or brown paper . For this reason , most people preferred to display their books in their bindings , much as earlier generations had displayed their library books in their gold - tooled individual bindings , usually in leather or vellum . Even late in the nineteenth century there were still some publishers who were not using dust jackets at all ( the English publisher Methuen is one example ) . Some firms , such as subscription houses which sold millions of cheap books door - to - door , probably never used them .
