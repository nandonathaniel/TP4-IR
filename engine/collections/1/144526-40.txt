The officers performed a strip - search on the arrested Black Panthers before cameras , after a Fairmount Park Police Officer had been murdered . The picture ran on the front page of the Philadelphia Daily News and was seen around the world Days later the charges against the Panthers were dropped for lack of evidence . Subsequently the search was ruled illegal . Four people unrelated to the Panthers were ultimately found guilty of the murder .
