By the early years of the twentieth century , the Salle Garnier was to see such great performers as Nellie Melba and Enrico Caruso in La Boh√®me and Rigoletto ( in 1902 ) , and Feodor Chaliapin in the premiere of Jules Massenet 's Don Quichotte ( 1910 ) . This production formed part of a long association between the company and Massenet and his operas , two of which were presented there posthumously .
