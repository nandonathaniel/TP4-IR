Results of the War of 1812 between Great Britain and the United States , 1812 - 1815 , involved with no geographical changes . The main result of the war was two centuries of peace between the United States and Britain . All the causes of the war had disappeared with the end of the war between Britain and France and with the destruction of the power of Indians to block American expansion into the Northwest . American fears of the Native Americans ended , as did British plans to create a buffer Native American state . The American quest for honor after its humiliations by the British were satisfied . The final collapse of the opposition Federalist Party opened an `` Era of good feelings '' with lessened partisanship and an exuberant spirit . The British paid little attention to the war , concentrating instead on their final defeat of Napoleon in 1815 . The U.S. failed to gain any territory from British North America , contrary to many American politicians ' hopes and expectations , but it did gain land from Spain .
