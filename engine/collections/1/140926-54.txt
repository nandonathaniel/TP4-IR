In ring - porous woods of good growth , it is usually the latewood in which the thick - walled , strength - giving fibers are most abundant . As the breadth of ring diminishes , this latewood is reduced so that very slow growth produces comparatively light , porous wood composed of thin - walled vessels and wood parenchyma . In good oak , these large vessels of the earlywood occupy from 6 to 10 percent of the volume of the log , while in inferior material they may make up 25 % or more . The latewood of good oak is dark colored and firm , and consists mostly of thick - walled fibers which form one - half or more of the wood . In inferior oak , this latewood is much reduced both in quantity and quality . Such variation is very largely the result of rate of growth .
