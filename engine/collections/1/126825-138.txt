After the shooting of Florida teenager Trayvon Martin , Today ran a selectively edited version of the 9 - 1 - 1 call that George Zimmerman made prior to shooting and killing Martin ( which he defended as being committed in self defense while standing trial for the shooting , for which he was acquitted on charges of murder in July 2013 ) , which had the effect of making Zimmerman appear racist . In a March 2012 edition of the program , Today played a recording of Zimmerman saying , `` This guy looks like he 's up to no good . He looks black . '' However , several seconds of the call were cut from the 911 tape , removing Zimmerman 's description of Martin , and a question asked to him about the teenager by the 911 operator . In the original , unedited tape , Zimmerman said , `` This guy looks like he 's up to no good . Or he 's on drugs or something . It 's raining and he 's just walking around , looking about . '' The operator then asked , `` OK , and this guy -- is he black , white or Hispanic ? , '' to which Zimmerman answered , `` He looks black . ''
