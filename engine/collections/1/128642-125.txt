Pier Paolo Pasolini 's 1972 film The Canterbury Tales features several of the tales , some of which keep close to the original tale and some of which are embellished . The Cook 's Tale , for instance , which is incomplete in the original version , is expanded into a full story , and the Friar 's Tale extends the scene in which the Summoner is dragged down to hell . The film includes these two tales as well as the Miller 's Tale , the Summoner 's Tale , the Wife of Bath 's Tale , and the Merchant 's Tale .
