The Amplified Bible ( 1965 , revised 1987 ) generally uses Lord , but translates Exodus 6 : 3 as : `` I appeared to Abraham , to Isaac , and to Jacob as God Almighty ( El - Shaddai ) , but by My name the Lord ( Yahweh -- the redemptive name of God ) I did not make Myself known to them ( in acts and great miracles ) .
