Many of the papers presented at these first two symposia were unreferenced . Prior to the symposia , the study of Turkish culinary culture was first popularized by the publication of Süheyl Ünver 's Fifty Dishes in Turkish History in 1948 . This book was based on recipes found in an 18th century Ottoman manuscript . His second book was about palace cuisine during the reign of Mehmet II . Following the publication of Ünver 's book subsequent studies were published , including a 1978 study by a historian named Bahaettin Ögel about the Central Asian origins of Turkish cuisine .
