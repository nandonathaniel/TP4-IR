The realisation of Zola 's ideas was hindered by a lack of capable dramatists writing naturalist drama . André Antoine emerged in the 1880s with his Théâtre Libre that was only open to members and therefore was exempt from censorship . He quickly won the approval of Zola and began to stage Naturalistic works and other foreign realistic pieces . Antoine was unique in his set design as he built sets with the `` fourth wall '' intact , only deciding which wall to remove later . The most important French playwrights of this period were given first hearing by Antoine including Georges Porto - Riche , François de Curel , and Eugène Brieux .
