Beginning in 1522 in the newly conquered Mexico , government units in the Spanish Empire had a royal treasury controlled by a set of officiales reales ( royal officials ) . There were also sub-treasuries at important ports and mining districts . The officials of the royal treasury at each level of government typically included two to four positions : a tesorero ( treasurer ) , the senior official who guarded money on hand and made payments ; a contador ( accountant or comptroller ) , who recorded income and payments , maintained records , and interpreted royal instructions ; a factor , who guarded weapons and supplies belonging to the king , and disposed of tribute collected in the province ; and a veedor ( overseer ) , who was responsible for contacts with native inhabitants of the province , and collected the king 's share of any war booty . The veedor , or overseer , position quickly disappeared in most jurisdictions , subsumed into the position of factor . Depending on the conditions in a jurisdiction , the position of factor / veedor was often eliminated , as well .
