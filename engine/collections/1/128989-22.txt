In 1820 Irish - born John England became the first Catholic bishop in the mainly Protestant city of Charleston , South Carolina . During the 1820s and ' 30s , Bishop England defended the Catholic minority against Protestant prejudices . In 1831 and 1835 , he established free schools for free African American children . Inflamed by the propaganda of the American Anti-Slavery Society , a mob raided the Charleston post office in 1835 and the next day turned its attention to England 's school . England led Charleston 's `` Irish Volunteers '' to defend the school . Soon after this , however , all schools for `` free blacks '' were closed in Charleston , and England acquiesced .
