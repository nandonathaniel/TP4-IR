The Catholic Monarchs had developed a strategy of marriages for their children in order to isolate their long - time enemy : France . The Spanish princes married the heirs of Portugal , England and the House of Habsburg . Following the same strategy , the Catholic Monarchs decided to support the Catalan - Aragonese house of Naples against Charles VIII of France in the Italian Wars beginning in 1494 . As King of Aragon , Ferdinand had been involved in the struggle against France and Venice for control of Italy ; these conflicts became the center of Ferdinand 's foreign policy as king . In these battles , which established the supremacy of the Spanish Tercios in European battlefields , the forces of the kings of Spain acquired a reputation for invincibility that would last until the mid-17th century .
