The liver is responsible for the mainstay of protein metabolism , synthesis as well as degradation . It is also responsible for a large part of amino acid synthesis . The liver plays a role in the production of clotting factors as well as red blood cell production . Some of the proteins synthesized by the liver include coagulation factors I ( fibrinogen ) , II ( prothrombin ) , V , VII , VIII , IX , X , XI , XIII , as well as protein C , protein S and antithrombin . In the first trimester fetus , the liver is the main site of red blood cell production . By the 32nd week of gestation , the bone marrow has almost completely taken over that task . The liver is a major site of production for thrombopoietin , a glycoprotein hormone that regulates the production of platelets by the bone marrow .
