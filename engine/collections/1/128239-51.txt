Baird disputed that Criner had `` confessed '' to the crime ( Criner 's statements to his friends `` did not describe the young lady , or the location , and did not necessarily even describe a sexual act that was consistent with the accusations against ( him ) , '' ) . Further he pointed out that the state did not introduce any evidence at trial of Ogg 's purported promiscuity . He accused the state of reversing itself , because it had originally argued that Ogg had not had sex with anybody besides Criner . Further , he pointed out that neither `` failure to ejaculate '' nor `` use of a condom '' arguments were presented to the jury at trial which the state does not dispute . He emphasized that juries were the heart of the judicial system . In 2009 , Texas Monthly said of this interview that Keller appeared to have considered the DNA evidence `` a technicality '' .
