The notable second verse mentions the narrator 's relationship with a New York City businessman ; despite their differing backgrounds the two become good friends and exchange gifts ( `` he 'd send me pictures of the Broadway nights / And I 'd send him some homemade wine '' ) . However , the businessman is `` killed by a man with a switchblade knife / for $43 my friend lost his life '' ; Williams replies that he would like to personally shoot the mugger himself , but not before `` ( spitting ) Beech - Nut in that dude 's eyes '' . ( The `` America Will Survive '' remix has the businessman being a victim of the 9 / 11 attacks . )
