Hunters are women and men who spend their lives hunting supernatural creatures and attempting to save those affected by these creatures . Most appear to have had some kind of negative encounter with the supernatural ( for example a relative being killed by demons , a spouse being possessed by a demon , or a sibling being turned by a vampire ) , which prompts them to become hunters . While hunters , by their nature , operate ' off - the - grid ' ( typically hunters support themselves via credit card fraud , although some have been shown to have actual jobs , such as the Singer Salvage Yard ) , there are , nevertheless , hunter communities that meet and interact with each other to exchange information and stories ; the Harvelle Roadhouse was one such location until it was burnt down . Typically , hunters find cases by consulting newspapers to track down information about suspicious deaths in certain areas . Some cases come about thanks to contact with people they knew before becoming hunters or contact with people they helped during previous hunts who turn to them for their expertise . Some hunters are shown to have particular targets , such as Sam and Dean 's initial hunts in the show 's first two seasons focusing on tracking the Yellow Eyed Demon who killed Dean and Sam 's parents , or Gordon Walker ' specializing ' in hunting vampires .
