Bulk cargo constitutes the majority of tonnage carried by most freight railroads . Bulk cargo is commodity cargo that is transported unpackaged in large quantities . These cargo are usually dropped or poured , with a spout or shovel bucket , as a liquid or solid , into a railroad car . Liquids , such as petroleum and chemicals , and compressed gases are carried by rail in tank cars .
