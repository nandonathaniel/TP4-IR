Hemoglobin ( Hb ) is the primary vehicle for transporting oxygen in the blood . Oxygen is also carried dissolved in the blood 's plasma , but to a much lesser degree . Hemoglobin is contained in red blood cells . Under certain conditions , oxygen bound to the hemoglobin is released into the blood 's plasma and absorbed into the tissues . Each hemoglobin molecule has the capacity to carry four oxygen molecules .
