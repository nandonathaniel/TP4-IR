During extraction , storage , transportation , and distribution , natural gas is known to leak into the atmosphere , particularly during the extraction process . A Cornell University study in 2011 demonstrated that the leak rate of methane may be high enough to jeopardize its global warming advantage over coal . This study was criticized later for its over-estimation of methane leakage values . Preliminary results of some air sampling from airplanes done by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration indicated higher - than - estimated methane releases by gas wells in some areas , but the overall results showed methane emissions in line with previous EPA estimates
