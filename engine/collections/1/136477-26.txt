In telegraphy and telephony , a lightning arrester is a device placed where wires enter a structure , in order to prevent damage to electronic instruments within and ensuring the safety of individuals near the structures . Lightning arresters , also called surge protectors , are devices that are connected between each electrical conductor in a power or communications system , and the ground . They help prevent the flow of the normal power or signal currents to ground , but provide a path over which high - voltage lightning current flows , bypassing the connected equipment . Arresters are used to limit the rise in voltage when a communications or power line is struck by lightning or is near to a lightning strike .
