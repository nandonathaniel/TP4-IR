Four EEA member states do not issue cards defined by EU as national identity cards to their citizens : Denmark , Iceland , Norway and the United Kingdom ( except to residents of Gibraltar ) ; although Norway is expected to start issuing such cards from 1 April 2018 . At present , citizens from these four countries can only use a passport as a travel document when travelling between EEA member states , and Switzerland . However , when travelling within the Schengen Area or Common Travel Area , other valid identity documentation ( such as a driving licence or EHIC card ) is often sufficient . Ireland issues a passport card which is valid as national identity card in other EU countries .
