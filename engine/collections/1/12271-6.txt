Aristotle 's ethics builds upon Plato 's with important variations . Aristotle 's highest good was not the good itself but goodness embodied in a flourishing human life . His ethics are based on eudaimonia , variously translated as `` happiness , '' `` prosperity , '' `` flourishing , '' or `` success . '' A `` great - souled '' citizen who lives a life of virtue can expect to achieve eudaimonia , which Aristotle argues is the highest good for man . Following Plato , Aristotle gives a significant role in moral life the virtues , fixed habits of behavior that lead to good outcomes ; the main virtues are courage , justice , prudence and temperance . The highest form of life is , however , purely intellectual activity .
