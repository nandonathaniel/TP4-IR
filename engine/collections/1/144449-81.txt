After the Stresa Conference and even as a reaction to the Anglo - German Naval Agreement , Italian dictator Benito Mussolini attempted to expand the Italian Empire in Africa by invading the Ethiopian Empire ( also known as Abyssinia ) . The League of Nations declared Italy the aggressor and imposed sanctions on oil sales that proved ineffective . Italy annexed Ethiopia in May 7 and merged Ethiopia , Eritrea , and Somaliland into a single colony known as Italian East Africa . On June 30 , 1936 , Emperor Haile Selassie gave a stirring speech before the League of Nations denouncing Italy 's actions and criticizing the world community for standing by . He warned that `` It is us today . It will be you tomorrow '' . As a result of the League 's condemnation of Italy , Mussolini declared the country 's withdrawal from the organization .
