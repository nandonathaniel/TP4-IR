The constitution and principles of the League were contained in the Green Book , written by Maulana Mohammad Ali . Its goals at this stage did not include establishing an independent Muslim state , but rather concentrated on protecting Muslim liberties and rights , promoting understanding between the Muslim community and other Indians , educating the Muslim and Indian community at large on the actions of the government , and discouraging violence . However , several factors over the next thirty years , including sectarian violence , led to a re-evaluation of the League 's aims . Among those Muslims in the Congress who did not initially join the League was Jinnah , a prominent statesman and barrister in Bombay . This was because the first article of the League 's platform was `` To promote among the Mussalmans ( Muslims ) of India , feelings of loyalty to the British Government '' .
