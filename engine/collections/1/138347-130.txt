The post-1973 years have seen a difficult and sometimes bloody transition from military to civilian rule , with several reversals along the way . The revolution of 1973 inaugurated a brief , unstable period of democracy , with military rule being reimposed after the 6 October 1976 Massacre . For most of the 1980s , Thailand was ruled by Prem Tinsulanonda , a democratically inclined strongman who restored parliamentary politics . Thereafter the country remained a democracy apart from a brief period of military rule from 1991 to 1992 . The populist Thai Rak Thai party , led by Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra , came to power in 2001 . He was popular with the urban , suburban , and rural poor for his populist social programs . His rule came under attack from elites who saw danger in his `` parliamentary dictatorship '' . In mid-2005 , Sondhi Limthongkul , a well - known media tycoon , became the foremost Thaksin critic . Eventually Sondhi and his allies developed the movement into a mass protest and later unified under the name of People 's Alliance for Democracy ( PAD ) .
