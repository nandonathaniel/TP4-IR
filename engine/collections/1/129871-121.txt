Two - thirds of the city 's 1.3 million residences are studio and two - room apartments . Paris averages 1.9 people per residence , a number that has remained constant since the 1980s , but it is much less than Île - de-France's 2.33 person - per - residence average . Only 33 percent of principal residence Parisians own their habitation ( against 47 percent for the entire Île - de-France ) : the major part of the city 's population is a rent - paying one .
