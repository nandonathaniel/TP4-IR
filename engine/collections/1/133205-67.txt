Bradley Meek , writing for THEM Anime , gave the series 3 / 5 stars . He praised the way the series maintained its horror - based atmosphere in between the action sequences . He greatly enjoyed the horror and action aspects , but felt that the character - driven segments in early episodes threatened to drag down the whole experience due to mundane content and poor characters . Talking about the anime 's second half , he said that it drastically altered the pace and content to the point that viewers might be put off with its conscious bending of the rules of handling characters and viewers alike -- Meek was ultimately angry at the series ' brutal ending , but it also left him eager to see its movie conclusion .
