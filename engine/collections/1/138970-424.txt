Even after the 1951 Census many Muslim families from India continued migrating to Pakistan throughout the 1950s and the early 1960s . According to historian Omar Khalidi the Indian Muslim migration to West Pakistan between December 1947 and December 1971 was from U.P. , Delhi , Gujarat , Rajasthan , Maharashtra , Madhya Pradesh , Karnataka , Andhra Pradesh , Tamil Nadu and Kerala . The next stage of migration , which lasted between 1973 and the 1990s , was when the migration of Indian Muslims to Pakistan was reduced to its lowest levels since 1947 . The primary destination for these migrants was Karachi and other urban centers in Sindh .
