By the first week of January 1999 , Arnold completed the song 's outline and made a synthesizer - arranged demo recording in his recording studio . He played the demo for Wilson , Broccoli and Apted , who were `` extremely pleased '' with the results . Arnold 's agent then presented the demo to MGM executives in Los Angeles , who initially disliked it because it was a ballad and they expected a more up tempo song . MGM asked Arnold to rewrite a three - note sequence considered too similar to a motif in earlier Bond themes .
