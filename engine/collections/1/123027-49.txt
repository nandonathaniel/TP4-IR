An operational definition of word stress may be provided by the stress `` deafness '' paradigm . The idea is that if listeners perform poorly on reproducing the presentation order of series of stimuli that minimally differ in the position of phonetic prominence ( e.g. ( númi ) / ( numí ) ) , the language does n't have word stress . The task involves a reproduction of the order of stimuli as a sequence of key strokes , whereby key ' 1 ' is associated with one stress location ( e.g. ( númi ) ) and key ' 2 ' with the other ( e.g. ( numí ) ) . A trial may be from 2 to 6 stimuli in length . Thus , the order ( númi - númi - numí - númi ) is to be reproduced as ' 1121 ' . It was found that listeners whose native language was French performed significantly worse than Spanish listeners in reproducing the stress patterns by key strokes . The explanation is that Spanish has lexically contrastive stress , as evidenced by the minimal pairs like tópo ( `` mole '' ) and topó ( `` met '' ) , while in French , stress does not convey lexical information and there is no equivalent of stress minimal pairs as in Spanish .
