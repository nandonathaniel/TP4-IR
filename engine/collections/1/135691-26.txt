Metastasis involves a complex series of steps in which cancer cells leave the original tumor site and migrate to other parts of the body via the bloodstream , via the lymphatic system , or by direct extension . To do so , malignant cells break away from the primary tumor and attach to and degrade proteins that make up the surrounding extracellular matrix ( ECM ) , which separates the tumor from adjoining tissues . By degrading these proteins , cancer cells are able to breach the ECM and escape . The location of the metastases is not always random , with different types of cancer tending to spread to particular organs and tissues at a rate that is higher than expected by statistical chance alone . Breast cancer , for example , tends to metastasize to the bones and lungs . This specificity seems to be mediated by soluble signal molecules such as chemokines and transforming growth factor beta . The body resists metastasis by a variety of mechanisms through the actions of a class of proteins known as metastasis suppressors , of which about a dozen are known .
