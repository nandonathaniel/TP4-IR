When the first early copyright law was first established in Britain with the Statute of Anne in 1710 , public domain did not appear . However , similar concepts were developed by British and French jurists in the 18th century . Instead of `` public domain '' , they used terms such as publici juris or propriété publique to describe works that were not covered by copyright law .
