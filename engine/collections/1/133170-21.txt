In the period from about 1790 to 1860 , the Mozart - era piano underwent tremendous changes that led to the modern form of the instrument . This revolution was in response to a preference by composers and pianists for a more powerful , sustained piano sound , and made possible by the ongoing Industrial Revolution with resources such as high - quality piano wire for strings , and precision casting for the production of massive iron frames that could withstand the tremendous tension of the strings . Over time , the tonal range of the piano was also increased from the five octaves of Mozart 's day to the seven octave ( or more ) range found on modern pianos .
