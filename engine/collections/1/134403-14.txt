The earliest grape vines planted in Washington State were at Fort Vancouver in 1825 by traders working for the Hudson 's Bay Company but it is not known for sure whether wine was ever produced from these plantings . The first people who were definitely known to produce wine were German and Italian immigrants who planted their wine grapes in Washington during the 1860s and 1870s . Washington was one of the first states to usher in the start of Prohibition , going dry in 1917 and shutting down most of the state 's wine production . Some scattered grape growers stayed afloat during this period selling grapes to home winemakers but nearly all the state 's commercial wines went out of business . Following the end of Prohibition , Washington 's fledgling wine industry was based primarily on fortified sweet wine production made from the Vitis Labrusca variety Concord . The Nawico and Pommerelle wineries were the most widely recognized producers , making millions of gallons each year of sweet jug wine made from Concord and other varieties . In the 1950s , the planting of Vitis vinifera saw an increase spearheaded , in part , by the work of Dr. Walter Clore and Washington State University which conducted a series of trials on which grape vines could produce the best wine in various soils and climates of Washington .
