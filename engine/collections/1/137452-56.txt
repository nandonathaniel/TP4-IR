The relationship between tax rates and poverty is disputed . A study comparing high tax Scandinavian countries with the U.S. suggests high tax rates are inversely correlated with poverty rates . The poverty rate , however , is low in some low tax countries like Switzerland . A comparison of poverty rates between states reveals that some low tax states have low poverty rates . For example , New Hampshire has the lowest poverty rate of any state in the U.S. , and has very low taxes ( 46th among all states ) . It is true however that both Switzerland and New Hampshire have a very high household income and other measures offsetting the lack of taxation . For example , Switzerland has Universal Healthcare and a free system of education for children as young as four years old . New Hampshire has no state income tax or sales tax , but does have the nation 's highest property taxes .
