While Mexico has produced several major international conductors , Alondra de la Parra has become the first Mexican - born woman to attain distinction in the profession . Similarly , Asian origin has become unremarkable , because of the international successes of conductors from the Far East such as Seiji Ozawa , who was the Boston Symphony Orchestra 's music director from 1973 until 2002 after holding similar posts in San Francisco and Toronto , and Myung - Whun Chung , who has held major posts in Germany and France and now is bringing the Seoul Philharmonic Orchestra to international attention . There is still under - representation of artists of black origin in the conducting profession , but there have been notable exceptions , such as Henry Lewis , Dean Dixon , James DePreist , Paul Freeman , and Michael Morgan . For more information on black conductors , see Black conductors . According to a 2004 article in The Guardian , `` black conductors are rare in the classical music world and even in symphony orchestras it is unusual to see more than one or two black musicians . ''
