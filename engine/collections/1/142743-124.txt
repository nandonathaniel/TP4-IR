In the Anglo - Saxon System of labour market regulation , the government 's legislative role is much more limited , which allows for more issues to be decided between employers and employees and any union or employers ' associations which might represent these parties in the decision - making process . However , in these countries , collective agreements are not widespread ; only a few businesses and a few sectors of the economy have a strong tradition of finding collective solutions in labour relations . Ireland and the UK belong to this category , and in contrast to the EU core countries above , these countries first joined the EU in 1973 .
