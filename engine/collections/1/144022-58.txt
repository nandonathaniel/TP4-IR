One problem with that approach is that it prevents the IS field from being interested in non-organizational use of ICT , such as in social networking , computer gaming , mobile personal usage , etc . A different way of differentiating the IS field from its neighbours is to ask , `` Which aspects of reality are most meaningful in the IS field and other fields ? '' This approach , based on philosophy , helps to define not just the focus , purpose and orientation , but also the dignity , destiny and , responsibility of the field among other fields .
