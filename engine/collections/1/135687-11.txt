Before 2011 , a cab 's availability was indicated by the lights on the top of the car . When no lights were lit , the cab would be occupied by passengers . When just the center light showing the medallion number was lit , the cab would be empty and available . When the OFF and DUTY inscriptions to either side of the medallion number were lit , with the medallion number off , the cab would be off duty and not accepting passengers . However , when the OFF and DUTY inscriptions were lit and the medallion number was still lit , the cab would be off duty but the driver could choose to pick up passengers heading in the same direction as the driver . In fall 2011 , the TLC announced a plan to replace the three - light system with a simple indicator as to whether the taxi is available . In 2012 , the TLC simplified the light system further , with a lit roof light indicating that the taxi is available and an unlit light indicating that the taxi is not available , regardless of whether it has passengers or is simply off duty . It also started fining drivers $100 for picking up passengers without the light on , except for if the driver is picking up their last passenger of their shift .
