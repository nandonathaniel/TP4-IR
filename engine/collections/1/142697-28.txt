Dogs bred for show are more homogeneous in appearance than working Border Collies , since to win in conformation showing they must conform closely to breed club standards that are specific on many points of the structure , coat , and colour . Kennel clubs specify , for example , that the Border Collie must have a `` keen and intelligent '' expression , and that the preferred eye colour is dark brown . In deference to the dog 's working origin , scars and broken teeth received in the line of duty are not to be counted against a Border Collie in the show ring . The males ' height from withers comes from 48 to 56 centimetres ( 19 to 22 in ) , females from 46 to 53 centimetres ( 18 to 21 in ) .
