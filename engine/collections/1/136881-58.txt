The film was shot in Los Angeles and the Hawaiian islands of Maui and Kauai between March 2 , 2010 and May 25 , 2010 . The film is deliberately vague about which Hawaiian island its latter portion depicts ; thus , the characters hike across a rope bridge on Maui and arrive in the next scene at a spectacular waterfall on Kauai , rather than the ordinary irrigation dam and pond on Maui where the actual trail terminates .
