Tom is instantly rejuvenated and takes the white mouse to kick him out of the window , then Jerry jumps out of the window . The moment Tom 's foot makes contact , the mouse causes a massive explosion which reduces the entire neighborhood to rubble , leaving only the radio speaker intact . The radio announcer states : `` We repeat , the white mouse will not explode '' . Tom emerges badly injured and drones , `` Do n't you believe it ! '' ( repeating a gag from the 1944 film Mouse Trouble ) as the cartoon closes .
