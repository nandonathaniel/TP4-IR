Once the Soviets withdrew , US interest in Afghanistan slowly decreased over the following four years , much of it administered through the DoD Office of Humanitarian Assistance , under the then Director of HA , George M. Dykes III . With the first years of the Clinton Administration in Washington , DC , all aid ceased . The US decided not to help with reconstruction of the country , instead handing the interests of the country over to US allies Saudi Arabia and Pakistan . Pakistan quickly took advantage of this opportunity and forged relations with warlords and later the Taliban , to secure trade interests and routes . The ten years following the war saw much ecological and agrarian destruction -- from wiping out the country 's trees through logging practices , which has destroyed all but 2 % of forest cover country - wide , to substantial uprooting of wild pistachio trees for the exportation of their roots for therapeutic uses , to opium agriculture .
