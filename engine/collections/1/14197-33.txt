When the Entente Powers divided the former Ottoman Empire under the Treaty of Sèvres at the close of World War I , Armenia was promised part of the Trebizond vilayet ( roughly corresponding to the modern Trabzon and Rize provinces in Turkey ) . This would have given Armenia access to the Black Sea . However , the Sèvres treaty collapsed with the Turkish War of Independence and was superseded by the Treaty of Lausanne ( 1923 ) , which firmly established Turkish rule over the area .
