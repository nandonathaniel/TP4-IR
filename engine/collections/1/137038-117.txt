Extreme , changeable and inconsistent temperatures are much more prevalent in spring than other seasons . In some occasions , hot searing days would be cooled down by a southerly buster , which eventually lower the temperatures from 40 째 C ( 104 째 F ) to as low as 19 째 C ( 66 째 F ) . Such extremes usually happen in mid-late spring . Other seasons seldom see such fluctuations in a day 's span . Furthermore , the diurnal range is higher in this season than it is in autumn .
