The Old Testament usually uses the name of God in the singular ( e.g. Ex. 20 : 7 or Ps. 8 : 1 ) , generally using the terms in a very general sense rather than referring to any special designation of God . However , the general name of God may branch to other special names which express his multifaceted attributes .
