17 January 1966 : the 1966 Palomares B - 52 crash occurred when a B - 52G bomber of the USAF collided with a KC - 135 tanker during mid-air refuelling off the coast of Spain . The KC - 135 was completely destroyed when its fuel load ignited , killing all four crew members . The B - 52G broke apart , killing three of the seven crew members aboard . Of the four Mk28 type hydrogen bombs the B - 52G carried , three were found on land near Almería , Spain . The non-nuclear explosives in two of the weapons detonated upon impact with the ground , resulting in the contamination of a 2 - square - kilometer ( 490 - acre ) ( 0.78 square mile ) area by radioactive plutonium . The fourth , which fell into the Mediterranean Sea , was recovered intact after a 21⁄2 - month - long search .
