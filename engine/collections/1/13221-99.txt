More recently , Six Sigma has included DMAIC ( for improving processes ) and DFSS ( for designing new products and new processes ) Reconfigurable Manufacturing Systems : a production system designed at the outset for rapid change in its structure , as well as its hardware and software components , in order to quickly adjust its production capacity and functionality within a part family in response to sudden market changes or intrinsic system change . Project Production Management : the application of the analytical tools and techniques developed for operations management , as described in Factory Physics to the activities within major capital projects such as encountered in oil & gas and civil infrastructure delivery .
