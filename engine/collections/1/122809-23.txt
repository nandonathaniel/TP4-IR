The design of the original IBM PC placed the Color Graphics Adapter ( CGA ) memory map and other hardware in the 384 KB upper memory area ( UMA ) . The need for more RAM grew faster than the needs of hardware to utilize the reserved addresses , which resulted in RAM eventually being mapped into these unused upper areas to utilize all available addressable space . This introduced a reserved `` hole '' ( or several holes ) into the set of addresses occupied by hardware that could be used for arbitrary data . Avoiding such a hole was difficult and ugly and not supported by DOS or most programs that could run on it . Later , space between the holes would be used as upper memory blocks ( UMBs ) .
