Javier Clemente was appointed as Spain 's coach in 1992 , leading them to the quarter - finals of the 1994 World Cup . The match became controversial when Italian defender Mauro Tassotti struck Luis Enrique with his elbow inside Spain 's penalty area , causing Luis Enrique to bleed profusely from his nose and mouth , but the foul was not noticed nor sanctioned by referee SÃ¡ndor Puhl . Had the official acknowledged the foul , Spain would have merited a penalty kick . In the 2002 World Cup , Spain won its three group play matches , then defeated the Republic of Ireland on penalties in the second round . They faced co-hosts South Korea in the quarter - finals , losing in a shootout after having two goals controversially called back for alleged infractions during regular and extra time .
