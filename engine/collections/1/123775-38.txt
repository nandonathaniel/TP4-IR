The Greek word susoichei is not well translated as now it is , bordereth neither expressing the force of the word , nor the apostle 's sense , nor the situation of the place . Secondly , psalm cv. 28 ( from the Great Bible ) , ' They were not obedient ; ' the original being , ' They were not disobedient . ' Thirdly , psalm cvi. 30 ( also from the Great Bible ) , ' Then stood up Phinees and prayed , ' the Hebrew hath , ' executed judgment . '
