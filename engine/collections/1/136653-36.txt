Indian Railways proposes to operate two types of services on the corridor . A `` Rapid Train '' service with only two stops at Surat and Vadodara , and a slower service that halts at all stations . The `` Rapid Train '' would complete the journey in 2 hours and 7 minutes , while the slower service would take 2 hours and 58 minutes . In total , 35 daily services will be operated on the line , with 3 services per hour during peak hours and 2 services per hour during off - peak hours . The Railways estimates that the high speed rail corridor will have a daily ridership of around 36,000 in 2023 .
