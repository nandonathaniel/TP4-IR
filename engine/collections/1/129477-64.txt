It is not uncommon to see beers named after the towns where they were brewed . For example , Texas ' own Shiner is brewed in Shiner , Texas . So , seeing a local brewery name a beer after the town or city is pretty common . However , what is not common is a town named after a beer . That is exactly what happened , though , in Texas with Pearl . In a small community just west of Yoakum , Texas , a small store had the highest Pearl beer single - point sales for a number of years prior to Prohibition . Walter G. Hagens ' general store was the focal point of the community , and it had sold Pearl 's beers by the truckload and still sold a rather large volume of the Prohibition - era nonalcohol Pearl . The idea to name the town after Pearl was concocted by Hagens and the local Pearl distributor , R.J. Eslinger . In 1942 , the motion passed and the German / Czech town became known as Pearl City .
