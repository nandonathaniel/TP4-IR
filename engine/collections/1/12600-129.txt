Laufey - Kratos ' second wife , who he referred to as Faye , and Atreus ' mother . She was one of the few remaining giants on Midgard who concealed her true nature from everyone . Upon giving birth to Atreus , Faye made him his bow and had Kratos teach him to hunt when he came of age . Faye later died of an unknown cause and Kratos burns her body on a funeral pyre , as her last wish was for her ashes to be spread at the peak of JÃ¶tunheim , where the two learn who Faye really was and that she and the giants knew of everything that would happen . It is also learned that she had already walked the path of Kratos and Atreus ' journey , and left clues behind to help them so that they would complete their journey .
