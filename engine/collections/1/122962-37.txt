Alden Ehrenreich as Han Solo : A cynical smuggler who is a part of Beckett 's crew . When asked how Solo differs from the Solo of latter Star Wars films , Ehrenreich stated , `` I think the main thing that 's different is that the Han we meet in this film is more of an idealist . He has certain dreams that he follows , and we watch how it affects him as those dreams meet new realities -- realities that are harder and more challenging than he 'd expected . '' The original Han Solo actor , Harrison Ford , met with Ehrenreich , giving him some insight and words of advice .
