Elijah has been the subject of legends and folktales in Muslim culture , usually involving his meeting with Khidr , and in one legend , with Muhammad himself . Most such legends , however , are regarded as folktales rather than actual events . In Islamic mysticism , however , Elijah is associated closely with the sage Khidr . One legend reported that Elijah and Khidr met together every year in Jerusalem to go on the pilgrimage to Mecca . Elijah appears also in the Hamzanama numerous times , where he is spoken of as being the brother of Khidr as well as one who drunk from the Fountain of Youth .
