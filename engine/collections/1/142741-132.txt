where β ( \ displaystyle \ beta ) is a positive constant that is not known explicitly . Since L n ∗ ≤ 2 n + 2 ( \ displaystyle L_ ( n ) ^ ( * ) \ leq 2 ( \ sqrt ( n ) ) + 2 ) ( see below ) , it follows from bounded convergence theorem that β = lim n → ∞ E ( L n ∗ ) / n ( \ displaystyle \ beta = \ lim _ ( n \ to \ infty ) \ mathbb ( E ) ( L_ ( n ) ^ ( * ) ) / ( \ sqrt ( n ) ) ) , hence lower and upper bounds on β ( \ displaystyle \ beta ) follow from bounds on E ( L n ∗ ) ( \ displaystyle \ mathbb ( E ) ( L_ ( n ) ^ ( * ) ) ) .
