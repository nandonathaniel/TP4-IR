The Orion correlation theory , as expounded by popular authors Graham Hancock and Robert Bauval , is based on the proposed exact correlation of the three pyramids at Giza with the three stars ζ Ori , ε Ori and δ Ori , the stars forming Orion 's Belt , in the relative positions occupied by these stars in 10500 BC . The authors argue that the geographic relationship of the Sphinx , the Giza pyramids and the Nile directly corresponds with Leo , Orion and the Milky Way respectively . Sometimes cited as an example of pseudoarchaeology , the theory is at variance with mainstream scholarship .
