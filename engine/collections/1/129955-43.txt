In developing the character of a young boy based on Kurosawa , Bhatia and Gupte explored some possible reasons why he failed in school . Their research led them to groups such as the Maharashtra Dyslexia Association and Parents for a Better Curriculum for the Child ( PACE ) . Dyslexia eventually became the central topic and theme of the film . The pair worked with dyslexic children to research and develop the screenplay , basing characters and situations on their observations . Bhatia and Gupte carefully concealed the children 's identities in the final version of the script .
