Wealthy Loyalists wielded great influence in London and were successful in convincing the British that the majority view in the colonies was sympathetic toward the Crown . Consequently , British planners pinned the success of their strategies on popular uprisings of Loyalists . Historians have estimated that Loyalists made up only 15 -- 20 % of the population ( vs. 40 - 45 % Patriots ) and that they continued to deceive themselves on their level of support as late as 1780 . The British discovered that any significant level of organized Loyalist activity would require the continued presence of British regulars , which presented them with a major dilemma . The manpower that the British had available was insufficient to both protect Loyalist territory and counter American advances . The vulnerability of Loyalist militias was repeatedly demonstrated in the South , where they suffered strings of defeats to their Patriot neighbors . The most crucial juncture of this was at Kings Mountain , and the victory of the Patriot partisans irreversibly crippled Loyalist military capability in the South .
