Fearing economic reprisals from Biddle and the Bank , Jackson moved swiftly to remove federal deposits from the institution . In 1833 , he succeeded in distributing the funds to several dozen private banks throughout the country . The new Whig Party emerged in opposition to his perceived abuse of executive power , officially censuring Jackson in the Senate . In an effort to promote sympathy for the institution 's survival , Biddle retaliated by contracting Bank credit , inducing a serious and protracted financial downturn . A reaction set in throughout America 's financial and business centers against Biddle 's economic warfare , compelling the Bank to reverse its tight money policies . By the close of 1834 , recharter was a `` lost cause . '' Rather than permitting the Bank to go out of existence , Biddle arranged its conversion to a state chartered corporation in Pennsylvania just weeks before its federal charter expired in March 1836 . This episode in the Bank 's decline and fall ended in 1841 with liquidation of the institution . Jackson 's campaign against the Bank had triumphed .
