Until recently , the differential pressure ( suction ) of transpirational pull could only be measured indirectly , by applying external pressure with a pressure bomb to counteract it . When the technology to perform direct measurements with a pressure probe was developed , there was initially some doubt about whether the classic theory was correct , because some workers were unable to demonstrate negative pressures . More recent measurements do tend to validate the classic theory , for the most part . Xylem transport is driven by a combination of transpirational pull from above and root pressure from below , which makes the interpretation of measurements more complicated .
