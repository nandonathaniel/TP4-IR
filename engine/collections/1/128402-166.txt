In France , a Wehrmacht propaganda company frequently accompanied Rommel on his inspection trips to document his work for both domestic and foreign audiences . In May 1944 the German newsreels reported on Rommel 's speech at a Wehrmacht conference , where he stated his conviction that `` every single German soldier will make his contribution against the Anglo - American spirit that it deserves for its criminal and bestial air war campaign against our homeland '' . The speech led to an upswing in morale and sustained confidence in Rommel .
