The primary result of mitosis and cytokinesis is the transfer of a parent cell 's genome into two daughter cells . The genome is composed of a number of chromosomes -- complexes of tightly coiled DNA that contain genetic information vital for proper cell function . Because each resultant daughter cell should be genetically identical to the parent cell , the parent cell must make a copy of each chromosome before mitosis . This occurs during the S phase of interphase . Chromosome duplication results in two identical sister chromatids bound together by cohesin proteins at the centromere .
