Num 10 : 10 stresses the importance in Israelite religious observance of the new month ( Hebrew : ראש חודש ‬ , Rosh Chodesh , `` beginning of the month '' ) : `` ... in your new moons , ye shall blow with the trumpets over your burnt - offerings ... '' Similarly in Num 28 : 11 . `` The beginning of the month '' meant the appearance of a new moon , and in Exod 12 : 2 . `` This month is to you '' .
