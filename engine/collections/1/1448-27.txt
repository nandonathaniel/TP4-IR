In `` The Crossing '' , JJ told Will that she was pregnant with his child . He later asked her to marry him , and indicated that he was willing to give up his detective 's shield in order to help take care of the baby and allow JJ to continue to do her job , though he was worried about her safety and the safety of their child . JJ later told Hotch she had found a temporary replacement for the duration of her maternity leave , and soon after gave birth to a baby boy named Henry . Will transfers to the MPDC , and the family live together in Washington . In later seasons , toddler Henry is portrayed by actress A.J. Cook 's real - life son Mekhai Andersen . JJ and Will named Reid and Technical Analyst Penelope Garcia as Henry 's godparents . When JJ returned from maternity leave , she and Will had exchanged rings with Henry 's birthstone , but did not seem to be officially engaged , as she wore her ring on her right hand , not the left . In the season seven finale , JJ tearfully asked Will to propose to her again , and they married the following evening in a small ceremony in David Rossi 's backyard .
