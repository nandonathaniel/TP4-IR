The border between North America and South America is at some point on the Isthmus of Panama . The most common demarcation in atlases and other sources follows the Dari√©n Mountains watershed divide along the Colombia - Panama border where the isthmus meets the South American continent . Virtually all atlases list Panama as a state falling entirely within North America and / or Central America .
