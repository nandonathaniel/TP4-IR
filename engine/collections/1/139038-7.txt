It is difficult to trace the origins of the uniform as there is no comprehensive written history , but rather a variety of known influences . School uniforms are believed to be a practice which dates to the 16th century in the United Kingdom . It is believed that the Christ Hospital School in London in 1552 was the first school to use a school uniform . The earliest documented proof of institutionalised use of a standard academic dress dates back to 1222 when the then Archbishop of Canterbury ordered the wearing of the cappa clausa . This monastic and academic practice evolved into collegiate uniforms in England , particularly in charity schools where uniform dress was often provided for poor children . Universities , primary schools and secondary schools used uniforms as a marker of class and status . Although school uniforms can often be considered conservative and old - fashioned , uniforms in recent years have changed as societal dress codes have changed .
