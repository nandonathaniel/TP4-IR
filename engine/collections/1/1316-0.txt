A nail file is a tool used to gently grind down and shape the edges of nails . They are often used in manicures and pedicures after the nail has been trimmed using appropriate nail clippers . Nail files may either be emery boards , ceramic , glass , crystal , plain metal files or metal files coated with corundum .
