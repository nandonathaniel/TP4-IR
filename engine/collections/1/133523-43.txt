In the 1920s , experiments by Paul Kammerer on amphibians , particularly the midwife toad , appeared to find evidence supporting Lamarckism . However , his specimens with supposedly acquired black foot - pads were found to have been tampered with . In The Case of the Midwife Toad ( 1971 ) , author and journalist Arthur Koestler surmised that the tampering had been done by a Nazi sympathiser to discredit Kammerer for his political views , and that his research might actually have been valid . However , most biologists believe that Kammerer was a fraud , and even among those who believe he was honest , most believe that he misinterpreted the results of his experiments .
