David Griffin of IGN said the show `` gets almost everything right '' as a `` cyberpunk fantasyland . '' Griffin praised the visuals and the complexity of the plot , as well as the acting , such as Chris Conner 's performance as the AI hotel manager Poe . He also wrote of the show 's problems , such as the intricacies of the murder often got `` in the way of the show 's momentum '' and the murder plot `` loses steam '' early on . He ultimately gave it a score of 8.8 out of 10 , summarizing it as `` A visual titan with a less than stellar story . '' Michael Rougeau of GameSpot made a point of calling it `` hardcore '' science fiction , as a `` noir sci - fi / gumshoe thriller bursting with the trappings of both genres , from murdered prostitutes and holographic billboard ads to AIs who flit between the real world and some convoluted cyberspace . '' The review praised how deeply the show examined and explored the cortical stack , the central concept . Catherine Pearson of Digital Spy said the visuals were magnificent and the themes fascinating , but that it had flaws ; for example , the characters `` mumbling their way through long expository dialogue .
