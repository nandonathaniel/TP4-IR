Fox also had two big science - fiction hits in the 1960s : Fantastic Voyage ( 1966 ) , and the original Planet of the Apes ( 1968 ) , starring Charlton Heston , Kim Hunter , and Roddy McDowall . Fantastic Voyage was the last film made in CinemaScope , which was ultimately replaced by Panavision lenses .
