In the two examples ( on the right ) the isoelectric point is shown by the green vertical line . In glycine the pK values are separated by nearly 7 units so the concentration of the neutral species , glycine ( GlyH ) , is effectively 100 % of the analytical glycine concentration . Glycine may exist as a zwitterion at the isoelectric point , but the equilibrium constant for the isomerization reaction in solution
