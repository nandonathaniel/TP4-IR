Criollos : a minority conformed originally by ancient families descendants of the Spaniards that conquered Central America and that by 1920 comprised both political parties in the country . By 1920 , they were mixed to a large extent with foreigners and the great majority had some Indian ancestry . They led the country both politically and intellectually , partly because their education , although poor for European standards of the time , was far superior to that of the rest of the people of the country , partly because only criollos were allowed in the main political parties , and also party because their families controlled and , for the most part , owned the cultivated parts of the country .
