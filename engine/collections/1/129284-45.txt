Salah was rarely used during the season . On 28 October 2014 , in a 2 -- 1 win at League Two club Shrewsbury Town in the fourth round of the League Cup , he took a shot that went so far off target that it went for a throw - in . After the game , he and fellow winger André Schürrle were criticised publicly by manager José Mourinho . Although Salah only made three league appearances before his loan move to Fiorentina , Mourinho stated that he would receive a replica winner 's medal from the club for his contributions that season .
