In Elk Grove Unified School District v. Newdow , after atheist Michael Newdow challenged the phrase `` under God '' in the United States Pledge of Allegiance , the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals found the phrase unconstitutional . Although the decision was stayed pending the outcome of an appeal , there was the prospect that the pledge would cease to be legally usable without modification in schools in the western United States , over which the Ninth Circuit has jurisdiction . This resulted in political furor , and both houses of Congress passed resolutions condemning the decision , unanimously . On June 26 , a Republican - dominated group of 100 -- 150 congressmen stood outside the capital and recited the pledge , showing how much they disagreed with the decision . The Supreme Court subsequently reversed the decision , ruling that Newdow did not have standing to bring his case , thus disposing of the case without ruling on the constitutionality of the pledge .
