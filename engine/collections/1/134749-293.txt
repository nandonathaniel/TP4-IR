A representative of Grand Ayatollah Ali Husseini al ‐ Sistani expressed concern with the ratified version of the pact and noted that the government of Iraq has no authority to control the transfer of occupier forces into and out of Iraq , no control of shipments , and that the pact grants the occupiers immunity from prosecution in Iraqi courts . He said that Iraqi rule in the country is not complete while the occupiers are present , but that ultimately the Iraqi people would judge the pact in a referendum . Thousands of Iraqis have gathered weekly after Friday prayers and shouted anti ‐ U.S. and anti-Israeli slogans protesting the security pact between Baghdad and Washington . A protester said that despite the approval of the Interim Security pact , the Iraqi people would break it in a referendum next year .
