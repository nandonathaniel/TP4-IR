The first Internet link into low earth orbit was established on January 22 , 2010 when astronaut T.J. Creamer posted the first unassisted update to his Twitter account from the International Space Station , marking the extension of the Internet into space . ( Astronauts at the ISS had used email and Twitter before , but these messages had been relayed to the ground through a NASA data link before being posted by a human proxy . ) This personal Web access , which NASA calls the Crew Support LAN , uses the space station 's high - speed Ku band microwave link . To surf the Web , astronauts can use a station laptop computer to control a desktop computer on Earth , and they can talk to their families and friends on Earth using Voice over IP equipment .
