Mandatory terms in an enterprise agreement are set out in Division 5 of the Fair Work Act 2009 . Agreements must include a flexibility term , that is , a mechanism for allowing variations in the agreement to meet needs of individual employees while still preserving basic entitlements and protections . They must include the obligation for the employer to consult with covered employees about major workplace changes that are likely to have a significant effect on the employees , and allow for the representation of those employees for the purposes of that consultation . The agreed - on base rate of pay can not be below that set by the relevant modern award .
