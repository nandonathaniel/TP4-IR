The production -- possibility frontier ( PPF ) is an expository figure for representing scarcity , cost , and efficiency . In the simplest case an economy can produce just two goods ( say `` guns '' and `` butter '' ) . The PPF is a table or graph ( as at the right ) showing the different quantity combinations of the two goods producible with a given technology and total factor inputs , which limit feasible total output . Each point on the curve shows potential total output for the economy , which is the maximum feasible output of one good , given a feasible output quantity of the other good .
