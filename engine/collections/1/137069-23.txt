Neanderthals are named after one of the first sites where their fossils were discovered in the 19th century , about 12 km ( 7 mi ) east of Düsseldorf , Germany , in the Feldhofer Cave , located in the Düssel River 's Neander valley . Thal is an older spelling of the German word Tal ( with the same pronunciation ) , which means `` valley '' ( cognate with English dale ) .
