Google displayed an interactive electric guitar doodle starting June 9 , 2011 , to celebrate the 96th birthday of Les Paul . Apart from being able to hover the cursor over the doodle to strum the strings just like one of Les Paul 's Gibson guitars , there was also a keyboard button , which when enabled allowed interaction with the doodle via the keyboard . The doodle still maintained some resemblance to the Google logo . In the U.S , the doodle also allowed the user to record a 30 - second clip , after which a URL is created and can be sent to others . The doodle remained on the site an extra day due to popularity in the US . It now has its own page linked to the Google Doodles archives .
