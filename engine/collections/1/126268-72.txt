Many rural areas and even some suburban areas of many states have no municipal government below the county level . In other places consolidated city - county jurisdictions exist , in which city and county functions are managed by a single municipal government . In places like New England , towns are the primary unit of local government and counties have no governmental function but exist in a purely perfunctory capacity ( e.g. for census data ) .
