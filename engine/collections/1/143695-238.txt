New Orleans has developed a distinctive local dialect of American English over the years that is neither Cajun nor the stereotypical Southern accent , so often misportrayed by film and television actors . It does , like earlier Southern Englishes , feature frequent deletion of the pre-consonantal `` r '' . This dialect is quite similar to New York City area accents such as `` Brooklynese '' , to people unfamiliar with either . There are many theories regarding how it came to be , but it likely resulted from New Orleans ' geographic isolation by water and the fact that the city was a major immigration port throughout the 19th century . As a result , many of the ethnic groups who reside in Brooklyn also reside in New Orleans , such as the Irish , Italians ( especially Sicilians ) , and Germans , among others , as well as a very sizable Jewish community .
