The Master said , The ( 夷狄 ) barbarians of the East and North have retained their princes . They are not in such a state of decay as we in China . The Master said , The Way makes no progress . I shall get upon a raft and float out to sea . The Master wanted to settle among the ( 九 夷 ) Nine Wild Tribes of the East . Someone said , I am afraid you would find it hard to put up with their lack of refinement . The Master said , Were a true gentleman to settle among them there would soon be no trouble about lack of refinement .
