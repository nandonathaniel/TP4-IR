During its first century of operation , the focus of the company was trade , not the building of an empire in India . Company interests turned from trade to territory during the 18th century as the Mughal Empire declined in power and the East India Company struggled with its French counterpart , the French East India Company ( Compagnie fran√ßaise des Indes orientales ) during the Carnatic Wars of the 1740s and 1750s . The battles of Plassey and Buxar , in which the British defeated the Bengali powers , left the company in control of Bengal and a major military and political power in India . In the following decades it gradually increased the extent of the territories under its control , controlling the majority of the Indian subcontinent either directly or indirectly via local puppet rulers under the threat of force by its Presidency armies , much of which were composed of native Indian sepoys .
