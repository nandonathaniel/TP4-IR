`` It is clearly better that property should be private '' , wrote Aristotle , `` but the use of it common ; and the special business of the legislator is to create in men this benevolent disposition . '' In Politics Book I , Aristotle discusses the general nature of households and market exchanges . For him there is a certain `` art of acquisition '' or `` wealth - getting '' , but because it is the same many people are obsessed with its accumulation , and `` wealth - getting '' for one 's household is `` necessary and honorable '' , while exchange on the retail trade for simple accumulation is `` justly censured , for it is dishonorable '' . Writing of the people , Aristotle stated that they as a whole thought acquisition of wealth ( chrematistike ) as being either the same as , or a principle of oikonomia ( `` household management '' -- oikonomos ) , with oikos meaning `` house '' and with ( themis meaning `` custom '' ) nomos meaning `` law '' . Aristotle himself highly disapproved of usury and cast scorn on making money through a monopoly .
