Cyberbrain sclerosis ( 電脳 硬化 症 , dennōkōkashō ) is a disease characterized by a hardening of the brain tissues precipitated by the cyberization process . It is described as being that century 's cancer or tuberculosis . Cyberbrain sclerosis is described as being extremely rare , enough so that it does n't deter most people from being cyberized , but it is incurable once diagnosed . In Stand Alone Complex , cyberbrain sclerosis patients are used by large corporations as guinea pigs in the development of micromachine ( マイクロマシン , maikuromashin ) technology , while the Murai vaccine ( 村井 ワクチン , Murai wakuchin ) for cyberbrain sclerosis is withheld from the public by those corporations via their political power - yet still being available to corporate executives and celebrities . This proves to be the explanation of the original `` Laughing Man Incident '' , in which the Laughing Man kidnapped the head of Serano Genomics , a micromachine manufacturer , in an attempt to persuade him to reveal the depth of the corruption within the political and medical community over the vaccine .
