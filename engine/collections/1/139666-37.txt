In November of this season , the iCarly crew accidentally starts a fan war at WebiCon over who should date , Carly and Freddie ( Creddie ) , or Sam and Freddie ( Seddie ) . Despite the three confirming that none of them are dating , the fan war still seemingly remains unresolved . However , five months later , the three complete their two - month search for an intern for iCarly , at which point Sam -- much to Carly 's and Freddie 's confusion and suspiciousness -- begins hanging out with Freddie and Brad , the new intern , every time she gets the chance to . When Freddie tests his selfmade `` MoodFace '' app on Sam , it confirms that she 's actually in love . Thinking that Sam still hates Freddie , he and Carly misunderstand the results , believing that Sam is in love with Brad , and Carly takes great steps into proving this . Sam still tries to convince her that she is not in love with him though . Freddie later finds Sam in the school yard and gives her a heart - to - heart talk about opening up and taking a risk when it comes to romantic feelings , not realizing that he is actually referring to himself . In the middle of the talk , Sam grabs Freddie and kisses him passionately , revealing that in fact he is the one she is in love with , as a shocked Carly watches through the window .
