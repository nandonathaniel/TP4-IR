Despite considerable losses , in early 1942 Germany and its allies stopped a major Soviet offensive in central and southern Russia , keeping most territorial gains they had achieved during the previous year . In May the Germans defeated Soviet offensives in the Kerch Peninsula and at Kharkov , and then launched their main summer offensive against southern Russia in June 1942 , to seize the oil fields of the Caucasus and occupy Kuban steppe , while maintaining positions on the northern and central areas of the front . The Germans split Army Group South into two groups : Army Group A advanced to the lower Don River and struck south - east to the Caucasus , while Army Group B headed towards the Volga River . The Soviets decided to make their stand at Stalingrad on the Volga .
