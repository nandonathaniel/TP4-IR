I think to lose Kentucky is nearly the same as to lose the whole game . Kentucky gone , we can not hold Missouri , nor Maryland . These all against us , and the job on our hands is too large for us . We would as well consent to separation at once , including the surrender of this capitol ( Washington , which was surrounded by slave states : Confederate Virginia and Union - controlled Maryland ) .
