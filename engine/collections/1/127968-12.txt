A midday meal scheme was introduced in Kerala in 1984 , and was gradually expanded to include more schools and grades . By 1990 -- 91 , twelve states were funding the scheme to all or most of the students in their area : Goa , Gujarat , Kerala , Madhya Pradesh , Maharashtra , Meghalaya , Mizoram , Nagaland , Sikkim , Tamil Nadu , Tripura and Uttar Pradesh . Karnataka , Orissa , and West Bengal received international aid to help with implementation of the programme , and in Andhra Pradesh and Rajasthan the programme was funded entirely using foreign aid .
