The Boeing Truss - Braced wing ( TBW ) concept was developed for the NASA - funded Subsonic Ultra Green Aircraft Research program with an aspect ratio of 19.5 compared to 11 for the Boeing 787 : the strut relieves some bending moment and a braced wing can be lighter than a cantilevered wing or longer for the same weight , having better lift - to - drag ratio by lowering the induced drag and thinner , facilitating natural laminar flow and reducing wave drag at transonic speeds ;
