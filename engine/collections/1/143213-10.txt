At a more advanced level , the net Arrhenius activation energy term from the Arrhenius equation is best regarded as an experimentally determined parameter that indicates the sensitivity of the reaction rate to temperature . There are two objections to associating this activation energy with the threshold barrier for an elementary reaction . First , it is often unclear as to whether or not reaction does proceed in one step ; threshold barriers that are averaged out over all elementary steps have little theoretical value . Second , even if the reaction being studied is elementary , a spectrum of individual collisions contributes to rate constants obtained from bulk ( ' bulb ' ) experiments involving billions of molecules , with many different reactant collision geometries and angles , different translational and ( possibly ) vibrational energies -- all of which may lead to different microscopic reaction rates .
