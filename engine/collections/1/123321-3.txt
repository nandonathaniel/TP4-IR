A problem with the motor shown above is that when the plane of the coil is parallel to the magnetic field -- i.e. when the rotor poles are 90 degrees from the stator poles -- the torque is zero . In the pictures above , this occurs when the core of the coil is horizontal -- the position it is just about to reach in the last picture on the right . The motor would not be able to start in this position . However , once it was started , it would continue to rotate through this position by momentum .
