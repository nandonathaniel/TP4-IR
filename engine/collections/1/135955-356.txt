At Tribal Council , the members of the Jury were all visibly shocked to see Kristie with the Immunity Necklace. Lee and El were both given the opportunity to campaign for Kristie to take them to the Final Two ; El tried to say that she had always tried to genuine and support Kristie through the game and that she was less likely to get votes from the jury , while Lee said that he would be happy with whatever decision Kristie made . With her sole vote , Kristie kept her promise to Lee , voting El off to become the ninth and final member of the jury .
