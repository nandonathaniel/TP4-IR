Compliance is the act of responding favorably to an explicit or implicit request offered by others . Technically , compliance is a change in behavior but not necessarily in attitude ; one can comply due to mere obedience or by otherwise opting to withhold private thoughts due to social pressures . According to Kelman 's 1958 paper , the satisfaction derived from compliance is due to the social effect of the accepting influence ( i.e. , people comply for an expected reward or punishment - aversion ) .
