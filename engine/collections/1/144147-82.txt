Other proteins that bind to actin regulate the length of the microfilaments by cutting them , which gives rise to new active ends for polymerization . For example , if a microfilament with two ends is cut twice , there will be three new microfilaments with six ends . This new situation favors the dynamics of assembly and disassembly . The most notable of these proteins are gelsolin and cofilin . These proteins first achieve a cut by binding to an actin monomer located in the polymer they then change the actin monomer 's conformation while remaining bound to the newly generated ( + ) end . This has the effect of impeding the addition or exchange of new G - actin subunits . Depolymerization is encouraged as the ( - ) ends are not linked to any other molecule .
