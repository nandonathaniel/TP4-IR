On December 10 , the Georgia World Congress Center Authority , in a unanimous decision , approved the blueprint and most of the agreement terms for the new stadium plans . According to The Atlanta Journal - Constitution article , the term sheet is non-binding and changes could be made at any time as regards stadium construction . Stadium location , however , is yet to be worked out ; proposed locations being reported are within walking distance of the Georgia Dome , with one site located one - half mile north , and the other one block directly south , at the one of the stadium 's existing parking lots . The project made national headlines for the first time in 2012 on December 15 , with team owner Arthur Blank stating in The New York Times that he would rather a new stadium be constructed than a `` remodeling job '' of the Georgia Dome .
