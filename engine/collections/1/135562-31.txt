In Boone 's youth , his family became a source of controversy in the local Quaker community when two of the oldest children married outside the endogamous community , in present - day Lower Gwynedd Township , Pennsylvania . In 1742 , Boone 's parents were compelled to publicly apologize after their eldest child , Sarah , married John Willcockson , a `` worldling '' ( non-Quaker ) . Because the young couple had `` kept company '' , they were considered `` married without benefit of clergy '' . When the Boones ' oldest son Israel married a `` worldling '' in 1747 , Squire Boone stood by him . Both men were expelled from the Quakers ; Boone 's wife continued to attend monthly meetings with their younger children .
