Generalized hypermobility is a common feature in all these hereditary connective tissue disorders and many features overlap , but often features are present that enable differentiating these disorders . The inheritance pattern of Ehlers - Danlos syndrome varies by type . The arthrochalasia , classic , hypermobility and vascular forms usually have an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance . Autosomal dominant inheritance occurs when one copy of a gene in each cell is sufficient to cause a disorder . In some cases , an affected person inherits the mutation from one affected parent . Other cases result from new ( sporadic ) gene mutations . Such cases can occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family .
