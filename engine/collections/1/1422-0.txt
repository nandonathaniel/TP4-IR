R / T is the performance marker used on Dodge automobiles since the 1960s ( much like Chevrolet Super Sport ) . R / T stands for Road / Track ( no `` and '' ) . R / T models usually come with R / T badging and a combination of upgraded suspension , tires , brakes , and often more powerful engines . Many models have also come with monotone paint and stripes as well as aggressive body kits . In 2004 the Chrysler SRT Division ( Chrysler Corp . SRT Vehicles ) replaced R / T as the high performance auto group for Dodge vehicles , though the trim level is still in use on many current models .
