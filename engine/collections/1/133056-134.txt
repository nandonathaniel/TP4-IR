Alcuin of York oversaw efforts to make an improved Vulgate , which he presented to Charlemagne in 801 . He concentrated mainly on correcting inconsistencies of grammar and orthography , many of which were in the original text . More scholarly attempts were made by Theodulphus , Bishop of Orléans ( 787 ? -- 821 ) ; Lanfranc , Archbishop of Canterbury ( 1070 -- 1089 ) ; Stephen Harding , Abbot of Cîteaux ( 1109 -- 1134 ) ; and Deacon Nicolaus Maniacoria ( mid-12th century ) . The University of Paris , the Dominicans , and the Franciscans following Roger Bacon assembled lists of correctoria ; approved readings where variants had been noted . Many of the readings that were recommended were later found to be interpolations , or survivals of the Old Latin text , since medieval correctors commonly sought to adjust the Vulgate text into consistency with Bible quotations found in Early Church Fathers .
