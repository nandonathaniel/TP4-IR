To distinguish themselves from the professional baseball team of the same name , the football team was incorporated as the `` New York National League Football Company , Inc . '' in 1929 and changed to `` New York Football Giants , Inc . '' in 1937 . While the baseball team moved to San Francisco after the 1957 season , the football team continues to use `` New York Football Giants , Inc . '' as its legal corporate name , and is often referred to by fans and sportscasters as the `` New York Football Giants '' . The team has also acquired several nicknames , including `` Big Blue '' , the `` G - Men '' , and the `` Jints '' , an intentionally mangled contraction seen frequently in the New York Post and New York Daily News , originating from the baseball team when they were based in New York . Additionally , the team as a whole is occasionally referred to as the `` Big Blue Wrecking Crew '' , even though this moniker primarily and originally refers to the Giants defensive unit during the 80s and early 90s ( and before that to the Los Angeles Dodgers baseball teams of the late 1970s and early 1980s ) .
