The race is a very important and popular sporting event in Alaska , and the top mushers and their teams of dogs are local celebrities ; this popularity is credited with the resurgence of recreational mushing in the state since the 1970s . While the yearly field of more than fifty mushers and about a thousand dogs is still largely Alaskan , competitors from fourteen countries have completed the event including the Swiss Martin Buser , who became the first foreign winner in 1992 .
