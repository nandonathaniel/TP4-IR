Commencement exercises each year begin with the senior class walking through the Wren Building and across the campus , crossing the Crim Dell bridge , and arriving at William & Mary Hall for the commencement ceremony . The graduating class processes into the arena as the Choir of the College of William & Mary sings the William & Mary Hymn .
