The Stanley Cup playoffs MVP award , the Conn Smythe Trophy is based on the entire NHL postseason instead of just the championship game or series , unlike the playoff MVP awards presented in the other major professional sports leagues of the United States and Canada ( the Super Bowl MVP , the NBA Finals MVP , and the World Series MVP ) , although in its history the trophy has never been given to someone that was not in the finals . Doug Gilmour and Peter Forsberg , in 1986 and 1999 , respectively , are the only players who have topped the postseason in scoring without making it to the Finals .
