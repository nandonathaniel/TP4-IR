The experiential subtheory also correlates with another one of Sternberg 's proposed types of giftedness . Synthetic giftedness is seen in creativity , intuition , and a study of the arts . People with synthetic giftedness are not often seen with the highest IQ 's because there are not currently any tests that can sufficiently measure these attributes , but synthetic giftedness is especially useful in creating new ideas to create and solve new problems . Sternberg also associated another one of his students , `` Barbara '' , to the synthetic giftedness . Barbara did not perform as well as Alice on the tests taken to get into school , but was recommended to Yale University based on her exceptional creative and intuitive skills . Barbara was later very valuable in creating new ideas for research ( Sternberg , 1997 ) .
