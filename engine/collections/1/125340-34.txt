It is commonly reported that the colonisation of Australia was driven by the need to address overcrowding in the British prison system , and the fact of the British losing the United States of America from the American Revolution ; however , it was simply not economically viable to transport convicts halfway around the world for this reason alone . Many convicts were either skilled tradesmen or farmers who had been convicted for trivial crimes and were sentenced to seven years , the time required to set up the infrastructure for the new colony . Convicts were often given pardons prior to or on completion of their sentences and were allocated parcels of land to farm .
