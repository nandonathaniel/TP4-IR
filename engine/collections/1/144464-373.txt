Marxists have offered various related lines of argument claiming that capitalism is a contradiction - laden system characterized by recurring crises coming from the tendency of the rate of profit to fall and having a tendency towards increasing severity . Capitalism is seen as just one stage in the evolution of the economic system . Immanuel Wallerstein , approaching matters from a world - systems perspective , cites the intransigence of rising real wages , rising costs of material inputs and steadily rising tax rates , along with the rise of popular antisystemic movements as the most important global secular trends creating unprecedented limiting pressures on the accumulation of capital . According to Wallerstein , `` the capitalist world - economy has now entered its terminal crisis , a crisis that may last up to fifty years . The real question before us is what will happen during this crisis , this transition from the present world - system to some other kind of historical system or systems ''. .
