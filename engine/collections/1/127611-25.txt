It may occur that systems of coordinates for two different sets of geometric figures are equivalent in terms of their analysis . An example of this is the systems of homogeneous coordinates for points and lines in the projective plane . The two systems in a case like this are said to be dualistic . Dualistic systems have the property that results from one system can be carried over to the other since these results are only different interpretations of the same analytical result ; this is known as the principle of duality .
