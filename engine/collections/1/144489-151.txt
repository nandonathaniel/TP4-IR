Fluoride in groundwater presents a public health problem in Jharkhand . A recent survey led by the Birla Institute of Technology , Mesra , Ranchi in collaboration with UNICEF in the northwest districts of Palamau and Garhwa found fluoride levels above the drinking WHO drinking water guidelines . Excessive amounts of fluoride in drinking water can lead to dental fluorosis , prevalent bone fractures , and skeletal fluorosis , an irreversible disabling condition . Some work has focused on combating fluorosis through increased calcium intake by consuming local plants . Researchers at Princeton University and the Birla Institute of Technology , Mesra , Ranchi are currently investigating defluoridation options , while performing an epidemiological survey to assess the extent of fluoride linked health problems and the impact of future interventions .
