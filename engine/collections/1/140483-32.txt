The U.S. Institute of Medicine ( IOM ) updated Estimated Average Requirements ( EARs ) and Recommended Dietary Allowances ( RDAs ) for vitamin A in 2001 . For infants up to 12 months there was not sufficient information to establish a RDA , so Adequate Intake ( AI ) shown instead . As for safety the IOM sets tolerable upper intake levels ( ULs ) for vitamins and minerals when evidence is sufficient . Collectively the EARs , RDAs , AIs and ULs are referred to as Dietary Reference Intakes ( DRIs ) . The calculation of retinol activity equivalents ( RAE ) is each μg RAE corresponds to 1 μg retinol , 2 μg of β - carotene in oil , 12 μg of `` dietary '' beta - carotene , or 24 μg of the three other dietary provitamin - A carotenoids .
