By the end of 1913 , the classical gold standard was at its peak but World War I caused many countries to suspend or abandon it . According to Lawrence Officer the main cause of the gold standard 's failure to resume its previous position after World War 1 was `` the Bank of England 's precarious liquidity position and the gold - exchange standard . '' A run on sterling caused Britain to impose exchange controls that fatally weakened the standard ; convertibility was not legally suspended , but gold prices no longer played the role that they did before . In financing the war and abandoning gold , many of the belligerents suffered drastic inflations . Price levels doubled in the US and Britain , tripled in France and quadrupled in Italy . Exchange rates changed less , even though European inflations were more severe than America 's . This meant that the costs of American goods decreased relative to those in Europe . Between August 1914 and spring of 1915 , the dollar value of US exports tripled and its trade surplus exceeded $1 billion for the first time .
