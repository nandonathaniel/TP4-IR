The Rays ' current ownership has long hinted that Tropicana Field does not generate enough revenue and that it is too far from the Tampa Bay Area 's population center . In 2007 , the team announced a plan to build a covered ballpark at the current site of Al Lang Field on the St. Petersburg waterfront , and a local referendum was scheduled to decide on public financing . However , in the face of vocal opposition , the Rays withdrew the proposal in 2009 and stated they had abandoned all plans for a ballpark in downtown St. Petersburg waterfront , preferring a location nearer the center of Pinellas County or across the bay in Tampa .
