The Space & Rocket Center introduces visitors to U.S. rocketry efforts from its predecessor at Peenem√ºnde with the German V - 1 flying bomb , through a progression of U.S. military rockets up to the Saturn rocket family civilian rockets , and on to the Space Shuttle . The Saturn V Dynamic Test Vehicle , the only Saturn V of the three on display to have been brought together outside a museum , is displayed overhead in a new building designed specifically for the rocket . The Space Shuttle Pathfinder was the first Space Shuttle -- a mockup made of steel and wood to test facilities for handling the vehicle -- and it now sits atop an external tank with solid rocket boosters attached .
