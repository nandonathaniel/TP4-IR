The Earth and its Moon are one example of this configuration . Today , the Moon is tidally locked to the Earth ; one of its revolutions around the Earth ( currently about 29 days ) is equal to one of its rotations about its axis , so it always shows one face to the Earth . The Moon will continue to recede from Earth , and Earth 's spin will continue to slow gradually . In about 50 billion years , if they survive the Sun 's expansion , the Earth and Moon will become tidally locked to each other ; each will be caught up in what is called a `` spin -- orbit resonance '' in which the Moon will circle the Earth in about 47 days and both Moon and Earth will rotate around their axes in the same time , each only visible from one hemisphere of the other . Other examples are the Galilean moons of Jupiter ( as well as many of Jupiter 's smaller moons ) and most of the larger moons of Saturn .
