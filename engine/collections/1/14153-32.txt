During 14 April 1912 , Titanic 's radio operators received six messages from other ships warning of drifting ice , which passengers on Titanic had begun to notice during the afternoon . The ice conditions in the North Atlantic were the worst for any April in the previous 50 years ( which was the reason why the lookouts were unaware that they were about to steam into a line of drifting ice several miles wide and many miles long ) . Not all of these messages were relayed by the radio operators . At the time , all wireless operators on ocean liners were employees of the Marconi 's Wireless Telegraph Company and not members of their ship 's crew ; their primary responsibility was to send messages for the passengers , with weather reports as a secondary concern .
