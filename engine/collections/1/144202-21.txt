In many versions , Excalibur 's blade was engraved with phrases on opposite sides : `` Take me up '' and `` Cast me away '' ( or similar ) . In addition , when Excalibur was first drawn , in the first battle testing Arthur 's sovereignty , its blade blinded his enemies . Thomas Malory writes : `` thenne he drewe his swerd Excalibur , but it was so breyght in his enemyes eyen that it gaf light lyke thirty torchys . ''
