Anne initially made a poor impression on the townsfolk of Avonlea with an outburst at the Cuthberts ' neighbour , the outspoken gossip Mrs. Rachel Lynde , but this was amended by an equally impassioned apology . Anne soon became ' bosom friends ' with a girl from a neighbouring farm , Diana Barry . Together with Matthew , Diana is Anne 's `` kindred spirit '' . The friendship was disrupted by the temporary enmity of Diana 's mother , after Anne mistakenly made Diana drunk with Marilla 's homemade currant wine , mistaking it for raspberry cordial . Anne was soon restored to Mrs. Barry 's good graces by saving the life of Diana 's little sister , Minnie May . Minnie May had an attack of the croup , which Anne was able to cure with a bottle of ipecac and knowledge acquired while caring for the numerous Hammond twins . Throughout her childhood , Anne continued to find herself in similar `` scrapes '' , often through mistakes and misunderstandings , and no fault of her own . At one point Anne `` admires to the point of nuttiness '' an amethyst broach , which she is falsely accused of stealing , a crime she has to confess to in order to attend a picnic . Anne tends to define herself in opposition to older people via humor , and forges a relationship with Marilla Cuthbert via humour . The dreamy and imaginative Anne aks that Marilla call her `` Cordelia '' and `` Geraldine '' as Anne likes to imagine herself as somebody that she is not .
