Allen David Landau as the Warden Jack LaRue as Ackerman ( uncredited ) Development and production ( edit ) A scene from the film trailer for I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang The film was based on a book written by Robert Elliott Burns in 1932 and published by Vanguard Press . The book tells the story of Burns ' imprisonment on a chain gang in Georgia in the 1920s , his subsequent escape and the furor that developed . The story was first published in January 1932 , serialized in True Detective mysteries magazine . Despite Jack L. Warner and Darryl F. Zanuck 's personal interest in adapting Burns 's book , the Warner Bros. story department voted against it with a report that concluded : `` this book might make a picture if we had no censorship , but all the strong and vivid points in the story are certain to be eliminated by the present censorship board . '' The story editor listed specific reasons for not recommending the book for a picture , most of them having to do with the violence of the story and the uproar that was sure to explode in the Deep South . In the end , Warner and Zanuck had the final say and approved the project . Roy Del Ruth , the highest - paid director of the Warner Bros. Studio , was assigned to direct , but the contract director refused the assignment . In a lengthy memo to supervising producer Hal B. Wallis , Del Ruth explained his decision : `` This subject is terribly heavy and morbid ... there is not one moment of relief anywhere . '' Del Ruth further argued that the story `` lacks box - office appeal , '' and that offering a depressing story to the public seemed ill timed , given the harsh reality of the Great Depression outside the walls of the local neighborhood cinema . Mervyn LeRoy , who was at that time directing 42nd Street ( which came out in 1933 ) , dropped out of the shooting and left the reins to Lloyd Bacon . LeRoy cast Paul Muni in the role of James Allen after seeing him in a stage production of Counsellor - at - Law . Muni was not impressed with LeRoy upon first meeting him in Warner 's Burbank office . Despite this meeting , Muni and LeRoy became close friends . LeRoy was present at Muni 's funeral in 1967 along with the actor 's agent . To prepare for the role , Muni conducted several intensive meetings with Robert E. Burns in Burbank to capture the way the real fugitive walked and talked , in essence , to catch `` the smell of fear . '' Muni stated to Burns : `` I do n't want imitate you , I want to be you . '' Muni also set the Warner Bros. research department on a quest to procure every available book and magazine article about the penal system . Muni also met with several California prison guards , even one who had worked in a Southern chain gang . Muni fancied the idea of meeting with a guard or warden still working in Georgia , but Warner studio executives quickly rejected his suggestion . The final line in the film `` But you must , Jim . How do you live ? '' `` I steal '' replied by James is among the most famous closing lines in American film . Director Mervyn LeRoy later claimed that the idea for James ' retreat into darkness came to him when a fuse blew on the set , but in fact it was written into the script . Impact on American society ( edit ) Audiences in the United States who saw the film began to question the legitimacy of the United States legal system , and in January 1933 , the film 's protagonist , Robert Elliot Burns , who was still imprisoned in New Jersey , and a number of other chain gang prisoners nationwide in the United States , were able to appeal and were released . In January 1933 , Georgia chain gang warden J. Harold Hardy , who was also made into a character in the film , sued the studio for displaying `` vicious , brutal and false attacks '' against him in the film .
