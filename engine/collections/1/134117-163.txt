Camouflage is common and widespread among beetle families , especially those that feed on wood or vegetation , such as leaf beetles ( Chrysomelidae , which are often green ) and weevils . In some species , sculpturing or various coloured scales or hairs cause beetles such as the avocado weevil Heilipus apiatus to resemble bird dung or other inedible objects . Many beetles that live in sandy environments blend in with the coloration of that substrate .
