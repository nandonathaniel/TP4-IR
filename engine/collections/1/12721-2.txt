Competition is only one of many interacting biotic and abiotic factors that affect community structure . Moreover , competition is not always a straightforward , direct , interaction . Interspecific competition may occur when individuals of two separate species share a limiting resource in the same area . If the resource can not support both populations , then lowered fecundity , growth , or survival may result in at least one species . Interspecific competition has the potential to alter populations , communities and the evolution of interacting species . On an individual organism level , competition can occur as interference or exploitative competition .
