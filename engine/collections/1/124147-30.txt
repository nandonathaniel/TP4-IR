The traditional incision approach of vasectomy involves numbing of the scrotum with local anesthetic ( although some men 's physiology may make access to the vas deferens more difficult in which case general anesthesia may be recommended ) after which a scalpel is used to make two small incisions , one on each side of the scrotum at a location that allows the surgeon to bring each vas deferens to the surface for excision . The vasa deferentia are cut ( sometimes a section may be removed altogether ) , separated , and then at least one side is sealed by ligating ( suturing ) , cauterizing ( electrocauterization ) , or clamping . There are several variations to this method that improve healing , effectiveness , and which help mitigate long - term pain such as post-vasectomy pain syndrome ( PVPS ) or epididymitis .
