Voters are required to place the number `` 1 '' against their first choice of candidate , known as the `` first preference '' or `` primary vote '' . Voters are then required to place the numbers `` 2 '' , `` 3 '' , etc. , against all of the other candidates listed on the ballot paper , in order of preference . ( Every candidate must be numbered , otherwise the vote becomes `` informal '' ( spoiled ) and does not count . ) Prior to counting , each ballot paper is examined to ensure that it is validly filled in ( and not invalidated on other grounds ) . The number `` 1 '' or first preference votes are counted first . If no candidate secures an absolute majority ( more than half ) of first preference votes , then the candidate with the fewest votes is excluded from the count . The votes for the eliminated candidate ( i.e. from the ballots that placed the eliminated candidate first ) are re-allocated to the remaining candidates according to the number `` 2 '' or `` second preference '' votes . If no candidate has yet secured an absolute majority of the vote , then the next candidate with the fewest primary votes is eliminated . This preference allocation is repeated until there is a candidate with an absolute majority . Where a second ( or subsequent ) preference is expressed for a candidate who has already been eliminated , the voter 's third or subsequent preferences are used .
