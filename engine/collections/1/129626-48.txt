Thus the process is continually evolving and correcting for anomalies that occur in the process . Eventually the process can evolve into periodic monitoring once sufficient data demonstrates that the process is in a state of control . Any anomaly that occurs once a process is in a state of control may result in the process being invalidated and not in control and could potentially result in product withdraw from the market to ensure patient safety . A formal product withdraw is only done when the quality , safety or efficacy of a product is questionable . A single anomaly would not necessarily require a product withdraw if there is sufficient stability data that demonstrates that excursions will not affect product quality .
