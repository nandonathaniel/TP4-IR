June 30 , 1805 Michigan Territory was organized from Indiana Territory , defined as north of a line east from the southern tip of Lake Michigan , and east of a line north from the lake 's northern tip . The southeastern portion of the border technically conflicted with the definition of Ohio , which claimed the Toledo Strip north of that line ; however , the exact position of Lake Michigan was not yet known .
