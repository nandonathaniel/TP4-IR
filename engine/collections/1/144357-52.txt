Andersen met Swedish opera singer Jenny Lind in 1840 , and fell in love with her , but she was not interested in him romantically ( although the two became friends ) . According to Carole Rosen , Andersen was inspired to model the icy - hearted Snow Queen on Lind after she rejected him as a suitor .
