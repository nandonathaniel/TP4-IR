Automatically selecting the attributes of a product ( in any category , i.e. product , promotion , etc . ) to maximize the number of customers preferring the resulting product is a computationally intractable problem . Given some customer profiles ( i.e. , customers sharing some features such as e.g. gender , age , income , etc . ) , the valuations they give to each potential product attribute ( e.g. females aged 35 -- 45 give a 3 out of 5 valuation to `` it is green '' ; males aged 25 -- 35 give 4 / 5 to `` it can be paid in installments '' ; etc . ) , the attributes of the products sold by the other producers , and the attributes each producer can give to its products , the problem of deciding the attributes of our product to maximize the number of customers who will prefer it is Poly - APX - complete . This implies that , under the standard computational assumptions , no efficient algorithm can guarantee that the ratio between the number of customers preferring the product returned by the algorithm and the number of customers that would prefer the actual optimal product will always reach some constant , for any constant . Moreover , the problem of finding a strategy such that , for any strategy of the other producers , our product will always reach some minimum average number of customers over some period of time is an EXPTIME - complete problem , meaning that it can not be efficiently solved . However , heuristic ( sub-optimal ) solutions to these problems can be found by means of genetic algorithms , particle swarm optimization methods , or minimax algorithms .
