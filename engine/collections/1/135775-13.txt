Academic Mathew N. Schmalz notes India as an example : `` you would have gossip and rumors , but it never reaches the level of formal charges or controversies . '' Traditionally , the Roman Catholic Church has held tight control over many aspects of church life around the globe , including `` the words used in prayer '' , but it left sex abuse cases to be handled locally . In 2001 , the church first required that sex abuse cases be reported to Rome . In July 2010 , the Vatican doubled the length of time after the 18th birthday of the victim in which clergymen can be tried in a church court . It also streamlined the processes for removing pedophile priests .
