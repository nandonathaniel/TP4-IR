Those with a conflict of interest are expected to recuse themselves from ( i.e. , abstain from ) decisions where such a conflict exists . The imperative for recusal varies depending upon the circumstance and profession , either as common sense ethics , codified ethics , or by statute . For example , if the governing board of a government agency is considering hiring a consulting firm for some task , and one firm being considered has , as a partner , a close relative of one of the board 's members , then that board member should not vote on which firm is to be selected . In fact , to minimize any conflict , the board member should not participate in any way in the decision , including discussions .
