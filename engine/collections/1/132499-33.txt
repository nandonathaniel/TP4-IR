There were New Netherland settlements in what later became the US states of New York , New Jersey , and Delaware , with short - lived outposts in areas of today 's Connecticut , Rhode Island and Pennsylvania . The capital , New Amsterdam , became the city of New York when the New Netherlanders provisionally ceded control of the colony to the English who renamed the city and the rest of the province in June 1665 .
