` Abbás Effendi was Bahá'u'lláh's eldest son , known by the title of ` Abdu'l - Bahá ( Servant of Bahá ) . His father left a Will that appointed ` Abdu'l - Bahá as the leader of the Bahá'í community , and designated him as the `` Centre of the Covenant '' , `` Head of the Faith '' , and the sole authoritative interpreter of Bahá'u'lláh's writings . ` Abdu'l - Bahá had shared his father 's long exile and imprisonment , which continued until ` Abdu'l - Bahá 's own release as a result of the Young Turk Revolution in 1908 . Following his release he led a life of travelling , speaking , teaching , and maintaining correspondence with communities of believers and individuals , expounding the principles of the Bahá'í Faith .
