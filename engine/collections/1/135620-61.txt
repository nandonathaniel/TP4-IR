There are several views from an early date over whether the Greek term adelphos , applied in these accounts to people described as adelphoi of Jesus , means that they were full brothers , half brothers , stepbrothers , or cousins . Helvidius , quoting Tertullian in support of his view , claims that the adelphoi were children of Mary and Joseph born after Jesus ; yet Jerome replied that Tertullian did `` not belong to the Church '' , and he argues that the adelphoi were Jesus 's cousins . Some scholars consider Helvidius ' view as the most natural inference from the New Testament . In support to this it is occasionally noted that James ( Jacob Iakobos ) as oldest of the brothers takes the name of Joseph 's father ( also James , Iakobos in the Solomonic genealogy of Jesus in Matthew ) , when in Bible times the grandson occasionally gets the name of the grandfather .
