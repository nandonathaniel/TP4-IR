During osteoblast differentiation , the developing progenitor cells express the regulatory transcription factor Cbfa1 / Runx2 . A second required transcription factor is Sp7 transcription factor . Osteochondroprogenitor cells differentiate under the influence of growth factors , although isolated mesenchymal stem cells in tissue culture , form osteoblasts under permissive conditions that include vitamin C and substrates for alkaline phosphatase , a key enzyme that provides high concentrations of phosphate at the mineral deposition site .
