The river continues southwards past railroad yards and the St. Charles Air Line Bridge . Between Polk and 18th Streets the river originally made a meander to the east ; between 1927 and 1929 the river was straightened and moved ‚ÅÑ mile ( 0.40 km ) west at this point to make room for a railroad terminal . The river turns to the southwest at Ping Tom Memorial Park where it passes under the Chicago Landmark Canal Street railroad bridge . The river turns westward where it is crossed by the Dan Ryan Expressway ; these immovable bridges have a clearance of 60 feet ( 18 m ) requiring large ships that pass underneath to have folding masts .
