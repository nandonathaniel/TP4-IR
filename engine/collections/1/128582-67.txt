In Chinese mythology , the giant Kua Fu drained the Yellow River and the Wei River to quench his burning thirst as he pursued the Sun . Historical documents from the Spring and Autumn period and Qin Dynasty indicate that the Yellow River at that time flowed considerably north of its present course . These accounts show that after the river passed Luoyang , it flowed along the border between Shanxi and Henan Provinces , then continued along the border between Hebei and Shandong before emptying into Bohai Bay near present - day Tianjin . Another outlet followed essentially the present course .
