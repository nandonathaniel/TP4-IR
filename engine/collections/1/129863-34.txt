On the first day , Russell wins the toss and elects to bat , giving the British officers a strong start . Bhuvan brings Kachra into the match only to find that Kachra has somehow lost his ability to spin the ball -- new cricket balls do not spin as well as worn - down ones ( which the team have been practising with ) . In addition , as part of his agreement with Russell , Lakha deliberately drops many catches . Later that evening , Elizabeth sees Lakha meeting with her brother . She races to the village and informs Bhuvan of Lakha 's deception . Rather than allow the villagers to kill him , Bhuvan offers Lakha the chance to redeem himself .
