The pessimists ' most telling argument in the SETI debate stems not from theory or conjecture but from an actual observation : the presumed lack of extraterrestrial contact . A civilization lasting for tens of millions of years might be able to travel anywhere in the galaxy , even at the slow speeds foreseeable with our own kind of technology . Furthermore , no confirmed signs of intelligence elsewhere have been recognized as such , either in our galaxy or in the observable universe of 2 trillion galaxies . According to this line of thinking , the tendency to fill up all available territory seems to be a universal trait of living things , so the Earth should have already been colonized , or at least visited , but no evidence of this exists . Hence Fermi 's question `` Where is everybody ? '' .
