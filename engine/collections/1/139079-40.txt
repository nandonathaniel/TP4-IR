Each episode ends ( as many cartoons did in the 1980s ) with Gadget ( and usually Penny and Brain also ) giving a public service announcement -- in direct contrast with his dangerous job and risk - taking behavior in the show , with most of the tips having a connection with problems Gadget had experienced during the episode . For example , in one episode , Gadget tries to hitchhike saying he hopes the approaching motorist does n't mind him doing so , with the ending PSA making very clear how dangerous hitchhiking can be . In another , Gadget and Penny use the story of the Trojan Horse to relate the danger of dealing with strangers . And another where Gadget gets drunk during an auto race and end the episode with a tip about the danger of drinking and driving .
