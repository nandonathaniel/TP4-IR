Juliet van Heusen ( Bridgit Mendler ; seasons 2 - 4 ) is a teenage vampire who is Justin Russo 's main love interest . When she was born , her parents let her have a soul so she could socialize in the human world . This also makes her more compassionate than most vampires , who are usually heartless and cunning . She is characterized as a beautiful girl with blonde hair and rather pale skin . She wears vanilla - scented perfume to hide her true vampire scent of death and decay in an attempt to avoid detection by monster hunters . She is also a health - conscious girl who has certain diet on her menu . Juliet 's development as a vampire is very slow , as her fangs have just started to grow at a late age for a vampire . She is also shown to not want to drink blood , and even tries to persuade her parents to abstain from drinking blood . As a very unusual character for a vampire , this trait is used for comic effect , especially when she empties a berliner with her fangs .
