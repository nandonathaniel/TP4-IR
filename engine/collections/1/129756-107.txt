Children are placed in special education services through an evaluation process . If the evaluation is not appropriately conducted or does not monitor the information that is needed to determine placement it is not appropriate . The goal of IDEA 's regulations for evaluation is to help minimize the number of misidentifications , to provide a variety of assessment tools and strategies , to prohibit the use of any single evaluation as the sole criterion of which a student is placed in special education services , and to provide protections against evaluation measures that are racially or culturally discriminatory . Overall , the goal of appropriate evaluation is to get students who need help , extra help that is appropriate for the student and helps that specific student to reach his or her goals set by the IEP team .
