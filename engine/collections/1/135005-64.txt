Like the rest of Central America , Costa Rica never fought for independence from Spain . On September 15 , 1821 , after the final Spanish defeat in the Mexican War of Independence ( 1810 -- 21 ) , the authorities in Guatemala declared the independence of all of Central America . That date is still celebrated as Independence Day in Costa Rica even though , technically , under the Spanish Constitution of 1812 that had been readopted in 1820 , Nicaragua and Costa Rica had become an autonomous province with its capital in Le√≥n .
