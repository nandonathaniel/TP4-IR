The film , which went into general release on January 7 , 1947 , placed 26th ( $3.3 million ) in box office revenues for 1947 ( out of more than 400 features released ) , one place ahead of another Christmas film , Miracle on 34th Street . The film was supposed to be released in January 1947 , but was moved up to December 1946 to make it eligible for the 1946 Academy Awards . This move was seen as worse for the film , as 1947 did not have quite the stiff competition as 1946 . If it had entered the 1947 Awards , its biggest competition would have been Miracle on 34th Street . The number one grossing movie of 1947 , The Best Years of Our Lives , made $11.5 million .
