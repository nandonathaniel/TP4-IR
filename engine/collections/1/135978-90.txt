Caesar 's Legion is one of the main antagonists of Fallout : New Vegas and is an autocratic , traditionalist , imperialistic slavery society , and totalitarian dictatorship . Ruled by Caesar ( real name Edward Sallow ) , a former member of the Followers of the Apocalypse who originated the Legion in Arizona and later expanded it into Colorado and parts of Utah , eventually conquering 87 different human tribes . Basing its culture and ideals on those of the historic Roman Empire , the Legion has relentlessly expanded its borders , enslaving the people it encounters and forcibly assimilating them to Caesar 's ideology , obliterating their native cultures in the process . The Legionnaires willingly reject most modern technology ( save for that involved in armaments ) and their society is based on a strict caste system . Men must become Legion warriors and wear approximations of ancient Roman armor . Women have no rights and are forced into servitude , mostly for housework and reproduction . Despite its brutality , some wasteland survivors appreciate the Legion for bringing order to previously savage regions that other factions , like the NCR , have ignored .
