A motion for new trial asks to overturn or set aside a court 's decision or jury verdict . Such a motion is proposed by a party who is dissatisfied with the end result of a case . This motion must be based on some vital error in the court 's handling of the trial , such as the admission or exclusion of key evidence , or an incorrect instruction to the jury . Generally the motion is filed within a short time after the trial ( 7 -- 30 days ) and is decided prior to the lodging of an appeal . In some jurisdictions , a motion for new trial which is not ruled upon by a set period of time automatically is deemed to be denied .
