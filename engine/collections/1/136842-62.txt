Unemployment rates historically are lower for those groups with higher levels of education . For example , in May 2016 the unemployment rate for workers over 25 years of age was 2.5 % for college graduates , 5.1 % for those with a high school diploma , and 7.1 % for those without a high school diploma . Unemployment rates roughly doubled for all three groups during the 2008 -- 2009 period , before steadily falling back to approximately their pre-crisis levels as of May 2016 . The recovery has also favored the more educated in terms of employment and job creation . One study indicated that nearly all the 11.6 million net jobs created between 2010 and January 2016 were filled by those with at least some college education . Only 80,000 net jobs were created for those with a high school education or less .
