`` Countries that remained on the gold standard , keeping currencies fixed , were more likely to restrict foreign trade . '' These countries `` resorted to protectionist policies to strengthen the balance of payments and limit gold losses . '' They hoped that these restrictions and depletions would hold the economic decline . Countries that abandoned the gold standard , allowed their currencies to depreciate which caused their Balance of payments to strengthen . It also freed up monetary policy so that central banks could lower interest rates and act as lenders of last resort . They possessed the best policy instruments to fight the Depression and did not need protectionism . `` The length and depth of a country 's economic downturn and the timing and vigor of its recovery is related to how long it remained on the gold standard . Countries abandoning the gold standard relatively early experienced relatively mild recessions and early recoveries . In contrast , countries remaining on the gold standard experienced prolonged slumps . ''
