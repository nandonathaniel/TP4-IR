There was also an unsuccessful attack on Zamboanga in 1648 . That year the Dutch promised the natives of Mindanao that they would return in 1649 with aid in support of a revolt against the Spanish . Several revolts did break out , the most serious being in the village of Lindáo . There most of the Spaniards were killed , and the survivors were forced to flee in a small river boat to Butuán . However , Dutch aid did not materialize or have objects to provide them. The authorities from Manila issued a general pardon , and many of the Filipinos in the mountains surrendered . However , some of those were hung or they were enslaved .
