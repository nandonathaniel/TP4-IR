During his second pass over the Indian Ocean , Glenn found that the Indian Ocean tracking ship was in heavy weather . The tracking station had planned to release balloons for a pilot observation experiment , but instead the ship fired star - shell parachute flares as Friendship 7 passed overhead . Glenn was able to observe the flashes of lightning from storms in the area but was unable to see the flares .
