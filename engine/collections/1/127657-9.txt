Saint Innocent I , who served in the papacy from 401 to 417 , championed papal supremacy in the entire Church . Saint Gelasius I , who served from 492 to 496 , in a controversy with Anastasius , the Byzantine emperor , likewise fought to maintain the doctrine of papal supremacy . This dispute was an incipient point of conflict between the Holy See and the Empire .
