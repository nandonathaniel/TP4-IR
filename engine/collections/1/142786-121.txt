In 1738 , an incident involving a Welsh mariner named Robert Jenkins sparked the War of Jenkins ' Ear between Britain and Spain . Hundreds of North Americans volunteered for Admiral Edward Vernon 's assault on Cartegena de Indias , a Spanish city in South America . The war against Spain merged into a broader conflict known as the War of the Austrian Succession , but most colonists called it King George 's War . In 1745 , British and colonial forces captured the town of Louisbourg , and the war came to an end with the 1748 Treaty of Aix - la - Chapelle . However , many colonists were angered when Britain returned Louisbourg to France in return for Madras and other territories . In the aftermath of the war , both the British and French sought to expand into the Ohio River valley .
