The tent is in Dubai . Clarkson compares his Volkswagen Golf GTI to May 's BMW i3 with a drag race at an airstrip and a road trip from London to Dartmoor to attend a Roger Daltrey and Wilko Johnson concert . Clarkson and Hammond make May hang out with `` winchers '' who drive their 4x4s deep into mud . For `` Celebrity Brain Crash '' , F1 racer Daniel Ricciardo drives a hovercraft toward the tent , but crashes before being sucked into the hovercraft 's fan . Hammond defeats the Bugatti Veyron in a drag race with the Porsche 918 Spyder , but quickly loses to a 1900 horsepower Nissan Patrol . Later , he travels to Michelin 's proving grounds in France to learn how to drift . He must then prove his skills against two professional drifters -- double amputee Bartek Osta≈Çowski and 13 - year - old Conor Shanahan -- at Rockingham Motor Speedway . May ends the episode with a series of outtakes of Clarkson and Hammond attempting to drift cars .
