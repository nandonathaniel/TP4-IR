In Brazil , particularly in SÃ£o Paulo , the dominant idea was that national workers were unable to develop the country , and that only foreign workers would be able to work in a regime of `` free '' ( i.e. , wage ) labour . The goal was to `` whiten '' Brazil through new immigrants and through future miscegenation in which former slaves would disappear by becoming `` whiter '' .
