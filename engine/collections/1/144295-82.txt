So - called superluminal motion is seen in certain astronomical objects , such as the relativistic jets of radio galaxies and quasars . However , these jets are not moving at speeds in excess of the speed of light : the apparent superluminal motion is a projection effect caused by objects moving near the speed of light and approaching Earth at a small angle to the line of sight : since the light which was emitted when the jet was farther away took longer to reach the Earth , the time between two successive observations corresponds to a longer time between the instants at which the light rays were emitted .
