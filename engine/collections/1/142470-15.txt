Reforms in criminal justice reforms , and juvenile justice in particular , are often fought in the court of public opinion . The popular news media plays a crucial role in promoting the myth of a new generation of young `` super-predators '' threatening the public . Despite documented decreases in youth crime , particularly in violent crime which indicate a 68 % decline in youth homicide in the 1990s , overall media coverage of youth crime is increasing . Despite evidence to the contrary , 62 % of respondents in a 1999 survey on youth delinquency believed that youth crime increased . Advocates for juvenile justice reform focus considerable attention on amending public opinion and adjusting the gap between the threats people perceive and the reality of juvenile crime .
