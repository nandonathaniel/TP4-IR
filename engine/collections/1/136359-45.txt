A source of emf can be thought of as a kind of charge pump that acts to move positive charge from a point of low potential through its interior to a point of high potential. ... By chemical , mechanical or other means , the source of emf performs work dW on that charge to move it to the high potential terminal . The emf E of the source is defined as the work dW done per charge dq : E = dW / dq .
