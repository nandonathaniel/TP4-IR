During World War I , Germany under Kaiser Wilhelm II fought a two - front war against French , British , Belgian , and ( later ) American forces on the Western Front while simultaneously fighting the Russians on the Eastern Front . Russia 's participation ended in the First World War , when the Bolshevik leaders signed the Treaty of Brest - Litovsk with Germany in March 1918 . Germany had foreseen such a scenario , and developed the Schlieffen Plan in order to counteract being surrounded by its enemies . Under the Schlieffen Plan , German forces would invade France via Belgium , Luxembourg , and the Netherlands ( the idea to go through the Netherlands was abandoned because of the country 's neutrality ) , quickly capturing Paris and forcing France to sue for peace . The Germans would then turn their attention to Russia in the east before the Tsar could mobilize his massive forces . Due to several factors however , the Germans failed to achieve the plan 's aims .
