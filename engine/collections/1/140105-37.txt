Boston - based alternative band the Adam Ezra Group released a parody of the song in 2013 called The Devil Came Up To Boston . It depicted the devil as a New Yorker who comes to Boston to have a fiddle - playing battle with a Bostonian youth . This premise itself is a play on the rivalry between Boston and New York . It parodies many other stereotypes and facets of Boston and its culture , such as its distinctive dialect , its Irish heritage , and its notoriously loud subway system , among other things . The song became a bit of a local legend in the Boston area , as many radio stations desired to play it , but could n't because of its extensive use of profanity , itself another stereotype of Bostonians .
