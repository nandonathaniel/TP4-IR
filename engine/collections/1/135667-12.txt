An active DI unit contains a preamplifier . Active DI units can therefore provide gain , and are inherently more complex and versatile than passive units . Active DI units require a power source , which is normally provided by batteries or a standard AC outlet connection , and may contain the option for phantom power use . Most active DI units provide switches to enhance their versatility . These may include gain or level adjustment , ground lift , power source selection , and mono or stereo mode . Ground lift switches often disconnect phantom power . Some active DI units also have electronic effects units .
