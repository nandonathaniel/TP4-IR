Imagine that you have set for yourself the task of developing a totally new social contract for today 's society . How could you do so fairly ? Although you could never actually eliminate all of your personal biases and prejudices , you would need to take steps at least to minimize them . Rawls suggests that you imagine yourself in an original position behind a veil of ignorance . Behind this veil , you know nothing of yourself and your natural abilities , or your position in society . You know nothing of your sex , race , nationality , or individual tastes . Behind such a veil of ignorance all individuals are simply specified as rational , free , and morally equal beings . You do know that in the `` real world '' , however , there will be a wide variety in the natural distribution of natural assets and abilities , and that there will be differences of sex , race , and culture that will distinguish groups of people from each other .
