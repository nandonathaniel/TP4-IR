Sometimes pieces of jujube fruit are preserved by storing them in a jar filled with baijiu ( Chinese liquor ) , which allows them to be kept fresh for a long time , especially through the winter . Such jujubes are called jiu zao ( 酒 枣 ; literally `` alcohol jujube '' ) . The fruit is also a significant ingredient in a wide variety of Chinese delicacies. .
