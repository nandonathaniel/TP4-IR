In many Commonwealth countries and other English - speaking jurisdictions ( e.g. , Canada , Australia , the Caribbean nations , Hong Kong , Malaysia , India , Pakistan , Bangladesh , Singapore , New Zealand , and South Africa ) , local spelling conforms more closely to British English usage , while the supplied keyboard is or based on the English ( US ) keyboard . In Windows 8 and later versions , the backslash \ key ( left of Z or space ) is duplicated onto the hash # key ( left of Enter ) , press which with Alt Gr key to type backslash \ , with Alt Gr and â‡§ Shift keys to type vertical bar .
