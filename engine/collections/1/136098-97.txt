There are two Holiday Trains that cover 150 stops in Canada and the United States Northeast and Midwest . Each train is roughly 1,000 feet ( 300 m ) in length with brightly decorated railway cars , including a modified box car that has been turned into a travelling stage for performers . They are each decorated with hundred of thousands of LED Christmas lights . In 2013 to celebrate the program 's 15th year , three signature events were held in Hamilton , Ontario , Calgary , Alberta , and Cottage Grove , Minnesota to further raise awareness for hunger issues .
