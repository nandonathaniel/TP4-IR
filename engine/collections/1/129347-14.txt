The 1922 Browns excited their owner by almost beating the Yankees to a pennant . The club was boasting the best players in franchise history , including George Sisler , and an outfield trio -- Ken Williams , Baby Doll Jacobson , and Jack Tobin -- that batted . 300 or better in 1919 -- 23 and in 1925 . In 1922 , Williams became the first player in Major League history to hit 30 home runs and steal 30 bases in a season , something that would not be done again in the Majors until 1956 .
