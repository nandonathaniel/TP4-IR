The region what is now Southern Brazil was originally settled by Amerindian peoples , mostly Guarani and Kaingangs . Only a few settlers from SÃ£o Paulo were living there . This situation made the region vulnerable to attacks from neighboring countries . This fact forced the King of Portugal to decide to populate the region . For this , settlers from the Portuguese Azores islands were sent to the coast .
