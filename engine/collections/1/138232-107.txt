After the Republic was proclaimed , the national flag was provisionally adopted as distinguishing flag of the head of state in place of the royal standard . On the initiative of the Ministry of Defence , a project was prepared in 1965 to adopt a distinct flag . Opportunity suggested the most natural solution was the Italian tricolour defaced with the coat of arms ; however , under conditions of poor visibility , this could easily be mistaken for the standard of the President of the United States of Mexico , which is also that country 's national flag . The standard is kept in the custody of the Commander of the Reggimento Corazzieri of the Arma dei Carabinieri , along with the war flag ( assigned to Regiment in 1878 ) .
