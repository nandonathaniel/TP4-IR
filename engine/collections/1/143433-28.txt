Following the reaction after the third film , Coppola stated that the idea of a fourth had been discussed but Puzo died on July 2 , 1999 , before they had a chance to write the film . Earlier , on June 21 , 1999 , The Hollywood Reporter had reported that a fourth film was in the works with García in the lead role . García has since claimed the film 's script was nearly produced . After Puzo 's death , Coppola decided to not continue the film series . Puzo 's portion of the potential sequel , dealing with the Corleone family in the early 1930s , was eventually expanded into a novel by Ed Falco and released in 2012 as The Family Corleone . The estate of Puzo had sought to keep Paramount Pictures from producing a feature film based on the novel . This has been resolved , with Paramount gaining the rights to make more Godfather films .
