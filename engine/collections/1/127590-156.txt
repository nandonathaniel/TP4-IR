Several enhancements to the Bohr model were proposed , most notably the Sommerfeld model or Bohr -- Sommerfeld model , which suggested that electrons travel in elliptical orbits around a nucleus instead of the Bohr model 's circular orbits . This model supplemented the quantized angular momentum condition of the Bohr model with an additional radial quantization condition , the Sommerfeld -- Wilson quantization condition
