Melanconis modonia can infect trees through injuries and induce `` bark death '' . It was first reported in Hungary by Hausz in 1972 . The damage is of little consequence in older or stronger trees , but it affects sapling graftings in nurseries . Coryneum perniciosum , one of the two conidium - like side forms of this fungus , occurs on all decayed , ligneous parts of a chestnut tree . The symptoms of infection on young smooth trunks is similar to that of the chestnut blight fungus Cryphonectria . For this reason , it has persistently been wrongly thought of as the pathogen for ink disease . With Melanconis , the bark sinks in and takes on brownish - red tones , with black lentil - like multicell conidium bodies and black cone - like stromas breaking through the bark . But unlike with Cryphonectria , there are no orange - colored fruiting bodies . Prevention primarily includes keeping the tree in good shape ; some further protections against Cryphonectria also help prevent bark death caused by Melanconis .
