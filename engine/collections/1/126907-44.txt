Although the spinal cord cell bodies end around the L1 / L2 vertebral level , the spinal nerves for each segment exit at the level of the corresponding vertebra . For the nerves of the lower spinal cord , this means that they exit the vertebral column much lower ( more caudally ) than their roots . As these nerves travel from their respective roots to their point of exit from the vertebral column , the nerves of the lower spinal segments form a bundle called the cauda equina .
