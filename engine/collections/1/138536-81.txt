The running order of `` Christmas '' and `` Eyesight to the Blind '' is reversed ; references to pinball are removed from `` Christmas '' and the character of The Hawker becomes The Preacher ( Clapton ) , leader of the Marilyn Monroe cult . Arthur Brown is cast as the character The Priest in the film , and sings a verse in the song but is not featured on the soundtrack . According to Russell 's DVD audio commentary , the concept of people literally worshipping celebrities ( in this case Marilyn Monroe ) and several other elements in the film were adapted from his pre-existing treatment for a film about false religions , which he had developed prior to Tommy but for which he had never been able to secure financial backing .
