Timothy 1 Thes. 1 : 1 , 2 : 6 Timothy is referred to as an apostle along with Silas and Paul . However , in 2 Cor. 1 : 1 he is only called a `` brother '' when Paul refers to himself as `` an apostle of Christ '' . Timothy performs many of the functions of an apostle in the commissioning of Paul in 1st and 2nd Timothy , though in those epistles Paul refers to him as his `` son '' in the faith .
