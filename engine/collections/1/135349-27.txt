In 1998 , the U.S. Transportation Research Board footnoted an estimate that the 1974 National Maximum Speed Limit ( NMSL ) reduced fuel consumption by 0.2 to 1.0 percent . Rural interstates , the roads most visibly affected by the NMSL , accounted for 9.5 % of the U.S ' vehicle - miles - traveled in 1973 , but such free - flowing roads typically provide more fuel - efficient travel than conventional roads .
