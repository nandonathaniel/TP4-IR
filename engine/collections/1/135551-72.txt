Civil Partnerships for clergy have been allowed since 2005 . The General Synod also voted in favour of extending pensions to clergy in civil unions . In a missive to clergy , the church communicated that `` there was a need for committed same - sex couples to be given recognition and ' compassionate attention ' from the Church , including special prayers . '' `` There is no prohibition on prayers ' being said in church or there being a ' service '' '' after a civil union . Some congregations have published `` Prayers for a Same Sex Commitment . '' After same - sex marriage was legalised , the Archbishops ' Council asked for the government to continue to offer civil unions saying `` The Church of England recognises that same - sex relationships often embody fidelity and mutuality . Civil partnerships enable these Christian virtues to be recognised socially and legally in a proper framework . ''
