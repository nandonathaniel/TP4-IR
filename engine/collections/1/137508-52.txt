The Blue Jays played their first game on April 7 , 1977 against the Chicago White Sox before a home crowd of 44,649 . The game is now perhaps best remembered for the minor snowstorm which began just before the game started . Toronto won the snowy affair 9 -- 5 , led by Doug Ault 's two home runs . That win would be one of only 54 of the 1977 season , as the Blue Jays finished last in the AL East , with a record of 54 -- 107 . After the season , assistant general manager Pat Gillick succeeded Peter Bavasi as general manager of the team , a position he would hold until 1994 .
