Viennese zitherist Johann Petzmayer ( 1803 -- 1884 ) became one of the outstanding virtuosi on these early instruments , and is credited with making the zither a household instrument . In 1838 , Nikolaus Weigel of Munich conceived the idea of adopting fixed bridges , adding additional strings , tuning them in the cycle of fifths , and chromatically fretting the fingerboard -- effectively converting a rather crude folk instrument into the concert zither . His ideas were not , however , widely accepted until 1862 , when luthier Max Amberger of Munich fabricated a new zither based on Weigel 's design . At this point the zither had reached something very close to its modern concert form . Within a relatively short time the new design had largely replaced the old Volkszither ( though still called by the same name among folk musicians ) throughout central Europe , particularly in the Alpine countries . As the ' concert zither ' it also began to attract the attention of serious composers , a number of whom , themselves , became concert zither virtuosi . These composers , called the `` Altmeister '' , flourished between 1870 and 1910 . And no less a composer than Johann Strauss II gave the instrument a prominent solo in one of his most famous waltzes , `` Tales from the Vienna Woods '' .
