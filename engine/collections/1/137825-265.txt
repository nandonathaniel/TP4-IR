The Jewish New Year ( Rosh Hashanah ) is a two - day public holiday in Israel . However , since the 1980s an increasing number of secular Israelis celebrate the Gregorian New Year ( usually known as `` Silvester Night '' -- `` ליל סילבסטר '' ) on the night between 31 December and 1 January . Prominent rabbis have on several occasions sharply denounced this practice , but with no noticeable effect on the secularist celebrants .
