The 2015 James Bond film , Spectre , the opening sequence featured a Day of the Dead parade in Mexico City . At the time , no such parade took place in Mexico City ; one year later , due to the interest in the film and the government desire to promote the pre-Hispanic Mexican culture , the federal and local authorities decided to organize an actual `` DÃ­a de Muertos '' parade through Paseo de la Reforma and Centro Historico on 29 October 2016 , which was attended by 250,000 people .
