Linguists realised from the 17th century onwards that the language spoken by these people , the Goidelic languages , was a branch of the Celtic languages . This is usually explained as a result of invasions by Celts from the continent . However , other research has postulated that the culture developed gradually and continuously , and that the introduction of Celtic language and elements of Celtic culture may have been a result of cultural exchange with Celtic groups in southwest continental Europe from the Neolithic to the Bronze Age .
