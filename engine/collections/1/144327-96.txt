In an application for leave seeking judicial review of an order for deportation of a Nigerian man , Humphreys J held for the High Court in August 2016 that leave should be granted , in part on the family rights of the unborn child at the time of the deportation . The state appealed this decision . On 7 March 2018 , the Supreme Court upheld the High Court and dismissed the state 's appeal in a unanimous decision that the Minister is obliged to take into account the fact of pregnancy ; however , it reversed other sections of the High Court and ruled the Minister is accordingly not obliged to treat the unborn as having constitutional rights other than the rights contained in Article 40.3. 3o .
