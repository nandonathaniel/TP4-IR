The area between where Power Dive and Cajun Cliffhanger had stood was transformed into Mardi Gras for 2004 . The wild - mouse roller coaster Ragin ' Cajun was added , along with a HUSS Top - Spin model named King Chaos , Zamperla Rockin ' Tug named Jester 's Wild Ride , and a Zamperla Balloon Race named Big Easy Balloons . Also , a HUSS Frisbee named Revolution was taken from Six Flags Great Adventure and opened in County Fair , replacing Ameri - Go - Round . Batman : The Ride was repainted for the 2004 season , going from black track and supports to yellow track with dark purple supports . Vertical Velocity received additional support structures on both its forward and rearward spikes . After sitting ( and rusting ) on a hill unused since 2002 , the dismantled pieces of Shock Wave were finally scrapped at the end of the 2004 season .
