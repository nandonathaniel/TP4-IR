Although it was stipulated that reform must proceed under KSČ direction , popular pressure mounted to implement reforms immediately . Radical elements became more vocal : anti-Soviet polemics appeared in the press ( after the abolishment of censorship was formally confirmed by law of 26 June 1968 ) , the Social Democrats began to form a separate party , and new unaffiliated political clubs were created . Party conservatives urged repressive measures , but Dubček counselled moderation and re-emphasized KSČ leadership . At the Presidium of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia in April , Dubček announced a political programme of `` socialism with a human face '' . In May , he announced that the Fourteenth Party Congress would convene in an early session on 9 September . The congress would incorporate the Action Programme into the party statutes , draft a federalization law , and elect a new Central Committee .
