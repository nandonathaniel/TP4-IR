According to Sheeran , Steve Mac started the song - writing session by playing the opening notes of the song on the keyboard . Sheeran then joined in , adding percussion by tapping on the guitar , layering it onto the track . On the writing of the song , he said that he tried to keep the music `` more stripped '' instead of something more elaborate : `` I 'm an acoustic artist , first and foremost . And when I play live , I ca n't replicate these things , I have n't got all the other musicians . '' Sheeran said he wanted an R&B feel to the song , therefore he adjusted the original tune , adding an interpolation of `` No Scrubs '' onto part of the melody . He also revealed that the original lyrics did not end with the words `` the shape of you '' in the chorus , but during the writing of the song , McDaid thought that the lyrics `` I 'm in love with your body '' sounded objectifying , and the lyrics was therefore adjusted .
