In 1864 , Andrew Johnson ( a War Democrat from Tennessee ) was elected Vice President under Abraham Lincoln . He became President after Lincoln 's assassination in 1865 . Under Johnson 's lenient re-admission policy , Tennessee was the first of the seceding states to have its elected members readmitted to the U.S. Congress , on July 24 , 1866 . Because Tennessee had ratified the Fourteenth Amendment , it was the only one of the formerly secessionist states that did not have a military governor during the Reconstruction period .
