Sensing an opportunity for their brands in terms of expansion of scale and variety , The Walker company became a shareholder in Coleburn Distillery in 1915 , quickly followed by Clynelish Distillery Co. and Dailuaine - Talisker Co. in 1916 . This ensured a steady supply of the output from the Cardhu , Coleburn , Clynelish , Talisker and Dailuaine distilleries . In 1923 , John Walker & Sons bought Mortlach distillery , in furtherance of their strategy . Most of their output was used in Johnnie Walker blends , whose burgeoning popularity required increasingly vast volumes of single malts .
