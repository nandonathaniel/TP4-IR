In Canada , an entry - level DX trim was added to the LX , EX , EX-L , and Touring packages for the 2008 - 2010 model years . The DX lacks features such as the `` 2nd - Row Plus One Seat with storage '' , conversation mirror with sunglasses holder , tinted glass , roof rails , and has black body moldings . The LX trim level was dropped for the 2010 model year , which also saw a SE Odyssey NHL edition replace the EX ( being identical to the 2008 - 09 EX in all respects but with a rear entertainment system and NHL badges ) . For the 2010 model year , the DVD rear entertainment system is now available on the EX-L trim and while it is still standard on the Touring .
