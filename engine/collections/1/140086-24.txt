In 884 , Charles the Fat reunited all the kingdoms of Francia for the last time , but he died in 888 and the empire immediately split up . With the only remaining legitimate male of the dynasty a child , the nobility elected regional kings from outside the dynasty or , in the case of the eastern kingdom , an illegitimate Carolingian . The illegitimate line continued to rule in the east until 911 , while in the western kingdom the legitimate Carolingian dynasty was restored in 898 and ruled until 987 with an interruption from 922 to 936 .
