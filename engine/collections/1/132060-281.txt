Circe -- Circe ran a magical beauty boutique in the Sea of Monsters , where she went by the alias of `` C.C. '' . While she treated females at her spa , she turned males into guinea pigs . When Percy was turned into a guinea pig , Annabeth used multivitamins from Hermes to restore him , and together they defeated Circe . In The Heroes of Olympus series , it is revealed that Circe employed Reyna and Hylla after they left Puerto Rico and treated them nicely , at least until the pirates were freed and proceeded to capture the sisters .
