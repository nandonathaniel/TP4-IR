The two one - shots were well received in the reader 's surveys of Fresh Jump and Tetsuo Hara was commissioned to turn Hokuto no Ken into a weekly series . Buronson was assigned to work with him as writer for the serialized version . The storyline was revamped , with the 1980s present - day setting in the original version replaced by a post-apocalyptic future world , and the protagonist Kenshiro , originally a teenager framed for a crime he did not commit in Hara 's prototype story , became an older and more stoic hero with a tragic past . Originally , Hara and Buronson were contracted to do Hokuto no Ken for a three - year run , but due to its popularity and the publisher 's demand , it was extended to a five - year run .
