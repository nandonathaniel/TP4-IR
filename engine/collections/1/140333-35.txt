The Tour de France , and other bicycle stage races , are decided by totalling the time each rider takes on the daily stages . Time can be added or subtracted from this total time as bonuses or penalties for winning individual stages or being first to the top of a climb or for infractions of the rules . The rider with the lowest overall time at the end of each stage receives a ceremonial yellow bicycling jersey and the right to start the next stage , usually the next day , of the Tour in the yellow jersey .
