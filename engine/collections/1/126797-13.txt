The most celebrated test of Earth 's rotation is the Foucault pendulum first built by physicist Léon Foucault in 1851 , which consisted of a lead - filled brass sphere suspended 67 m from the top of the Panthéon in Paris . Because of the Earth 's rotation under the swinging pendulum , the pendulum 's plane of oscillation appears to rotate at a rate depending on latitude . At the latitude of Paris the predicted and observed shift was about 11 degrees clockwise per hour . Foucault pendulums now swing in museums around the world .
