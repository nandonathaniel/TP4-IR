The Chinese used chariots for horse - based warfare until light cavalry forces became common during the Warring States era ( 402 -- 221 BC ) . A major proponent of the change to riding horses from chariots was Wu Ling , c. 320 BC . However , conservative forces in China often opposed change , and cavalry never became as dominant as in Europe . Cavalry in China also did not benefit from the additional cachet attached to being the military branch dominated by the nobility .
