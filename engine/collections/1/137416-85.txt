Since the arrival of Apple 's native iOS App Store , and -- along with it -- third - party applications , the general motives for jailbreaking have changed . People jailbreak for many different reasons , including gaining filesystem access , installing custom device themes , and modifying SpringBoard . An additional motivation is that it may enable the installation of pirated apps . On some devices , jailbreaking also makes it possible to install alternative operating systems , such as Android and the Linux kernel . Primarily , users jailbreak their devices because of the limitations of iOS . Depending on the method used , the effects of jailbreaking may be permanent or temporary .
