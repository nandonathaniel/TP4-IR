Jake Malloy ( Jamie Bamber ) is NCIS Agent Ellie Bishop 's ex-husband and an attorney for the National Security Agency . He becomes friends with Ellie 's boss , SSA Leroy Jethro Gibbs . After her transfer from the NSA to NCIS , Jake and Ellie 's marriage begins to show signs of stress , which he disingenuously attributes to the fact that they can no longer talk about their day with each other like they used to . However , it is revealed , in the season 13 episode 9 `` Day In Court '' , that Jake has been dishonest , having an affair with fellow NSA employee Taylor Matthews . Following this revelation , Bishop returns home to Oklahoma for some time to herself . Then in the `` Spinning Wheel '' Jake comes to Bishop and makes attempts to apologize for the infidelity , but she recognizes that an affair is only a symptom of a wider pattern , and tells him that their marriage is over .
