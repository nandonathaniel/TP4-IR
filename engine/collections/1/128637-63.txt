Printing with a press was practiced in Christian Europe as a method for printing on cloth , where it was common by 1300 . Images printed on cloth for religious purposes could be quite large and elaborate , and when paper became relatively easily available , around 1400 , the medium transferred very quickly to small woodcut religious images and playing cards printed on paper . These prints were produced in very large numbers from about 1425 onwards .
