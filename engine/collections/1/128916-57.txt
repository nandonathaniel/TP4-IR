The idea of progress did not exist in the Greek Underworld -- at the moment of death , the psyche was frozen , in experience and appearance . The souls in the Underworld did not age or really change in any sense . They did not lead any sort of active life in the Underworld -- they were exactly the same as they were in life . Therefore , those who had died in battle were eternally blood - spattered in the underworld and those who had died peacefully were able to remain that way .
