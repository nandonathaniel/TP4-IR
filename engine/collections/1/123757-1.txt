The method is a continuous process that begins with observations about the natural world . People are naturally inquisitive , so they often come up with questions about things they see or hear , and they often develop ideas or hypotheses about why things are the way they are . The best hypotheses lead to predictions that can be tested in various ways . The strongest tests of hypotheses come from carefully controlled experiments that gather empirical data . Depending on how well additional tests match the predictions , the original hypothesis may require refinement , alteration , expansion or even rejection . If a particular hypothesis becomes very well supported , a general theory may be developed .
