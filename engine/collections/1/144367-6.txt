Barriers to gene flow need not always be physical . Sympatric speciation happens when new species from the same ancestral species arise along the same range . This is often a result of a reproductive barrier . For example , two palm species of Howea found on Lord Howe Island were found to have substantially different flowering times correlated with soil preference , resulting in a reproductive barrier inhibiting gene flow . Species can live in the same environment , yet show very limited gene flow due to reproductive barriers , fragmentation , specialist pollinators , or limited hybridization or hybridization yielding unfit hybrids . A cryptic species is a species that humans can not tell is different without the use of genetics . Moreover , gene flow between hybrid and wild populations can result in loss of genetic diversity via genetic pollution , assortative mating and outbreeding .
