On 17 July 1936 , General Francisco Franco brought the colonial army stationed in Morocco to the mainland , while another force from the north under General Mola moved south from Navarre . Another conspirator , General Sanjurjo , who was in exile in Portugal , was killed in a plane crash while being brought to join the other military leaders . Military units were also mobilised elsewhere to take over government institutions . Franco intended to seize power immediately , but successful resistance by Republicans in the key centers of Madrid , Barcelona , Valencia , the Basque country , and other points meant that Spain faced a prolonged civil war . By 1937 much of the south and west was under the control of the Nationalists , whose Army of Africa was the most professional force available to either side . Both sides received foreign military aid : the Nationalists from Nazi Germany and Italy , while the Republicans were supported by organised far - left volunteers from the Soviet Union .
