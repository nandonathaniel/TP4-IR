Transcription is the process of copying genetic information stored in a DNA strand into a transportable complementary strand of RNA . Eukaryotic transcription takes place in the nucleus of the cell and proceeds in three sequential stages : initiation , elongation , and termination . The transcriptional machinery that catalyzes this complex reaction has at its core three multi-subunit RNA polymerases . RNA polymerase I is responsible for transcribing RNA that codes for genes that become structural components of the ribosome .
