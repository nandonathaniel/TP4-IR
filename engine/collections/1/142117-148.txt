For 2011 , the Shelby GT500 received significant performance enhancements and other upgrades . Arguably the most important of the GT500 's upgrades is a new aluminum engine block for the car 's supercharged 5.4 L DOHC V8 , replacing the cast - iron block used previously . The block 's cylinder bores are coated with an iron and iron oxide composite that is applied with Plasma Transferred Wire Arc ( PTWA ) technology , which was developed jointly by Ford and Flamespray Industries ( www.flame-spray.com ) . The developers of PTWA received the IPO 2009 National Inventor of the Year award . The coating allows for the replacement of traditional cast - iron cylinder liners and marks Ford 's first use of this process . Between this and the use of lighter - weight aluminum for the engine block , the new block is 102 lbs lighter than the previous cast - iron version , contributing to a reduction in the overall weight of the GT500 compared to the 2010 model . Thanks to the new liner coating , which has friction - reducing characteristics , and a revised exhaust , horsepower production from the 5.4 L V8 has increased slightly for a total of 550 bhp ( 410 kW ) @ 6200rpm . The combination of the lighter engine , EPAS , and aerodynamic enhancements result in an improvement in fuel efficiency for the 2011 GT500 relative to the 2010 model that eliminates the car 's gas guzzler tax .
