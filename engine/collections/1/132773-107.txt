During the 10th century and onwards , cities and towns gained more importance and power , as commerce reappeared and the population kept growing . Fueros were charters documenting the privileges and usages given to all the people repopulating a town . The fueros provided a means of escape from the feudal system , as fueros were only granted by the monarch . As a result , the town council was dependent on the monarch alone and , in turn , was required to provide auxilium -- aid or troops -- for their monarch . The military force of the towns became the caballeros villanos . The first fuero was given by count Fernán González to the inhabitants of Castrojeriz in the 940 's . The most important towns of medieval Iberia had fueros , or forais . In Navarre , fueros were the main repopulating system . Later on , in the 12th century , Aragon also employed the system ; for example , the fuero of Teruel , which was one of the last fueros , in the early 13th century .
