The Speech House , between Coleford and Cinderford , was built in 1682 to host the Court of Mine Law and `` Court of the Speech '' , a sort of parliament for the Verderers and Free Miners managing the forest , game , and mineral resources . The Gaveller and his deputy were responsible for leasing gales - areas allocated for mining - on behalf of the Crown . The Speech House has been used as an inn and hotel since the 19th century .
