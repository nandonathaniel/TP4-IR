Jackson 's troops were awakened at 4 a.m. on May 25 to fight the second Sunday battle of the campaign . Jackson was pleased to find during a personal reconnaissance that Banks had not properly secured a key ridge south of the town . He ordered Charles Winder 's Stonewall Brigade to occupy the hill , which they did with little opposition , but they were soon subjected to punishing artillery and small arms fire from a second ridge to the southwest -- Bower 's Hill , the extreme right flank of the Federal line -- and their attack stalled . Jackson ordered Taylor 's Brigade to deploy to the west and the Louisianians conducted a strong charge against Bower 's Hill , moving up the steep slope and over a stone wall . At the same time , Ewell 's men were outflanking the extreme left of the Union line . The Union lines broke and the soldiers retreated through the streets of town . Jackson later wrote that Banks 's troops `` preserved their organization remarkably well '' through the town . They did so under unusual pressure , as numerous civilians -- primarily women -- fired at the men and hurled objects from doorways and windows . Jackson was overcome with enthusiasm and rode cheering after the retreating enemy . When a staff officer protested that he was in an exposed position , Jackson shouted `` Go back and tell the whole army to press forward to the Potomac ! ''
