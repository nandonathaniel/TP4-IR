Florida attracted numerous Africans and African - Americans from adjacent British colonies who sought freedom from slavery . In 1738 , Governor Manuel de Montiano established Fort Gracia Real de Santa Teresa de Mose near St. Augustine , a fortified town for escaped slaves to whom Montiano granted citizenship and freedom in return for their service in the Florida militia , and which became the first free black settlement legally sanctioned in North America .
