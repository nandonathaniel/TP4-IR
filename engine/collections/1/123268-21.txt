There are 40 possible straight flush hands and 10 distinct ranks of straight flush under high rules when using a standard 52 - card deck . Each straight flush is ranked by the rank of its highest - ranking card . For example , 10 ♣ 9 ♣ 8 ♣ 7 ♣ 6 ♣ ranks higher than 8 ♥ 7 ♥ 6 ♥ 5 ♥ 4 ♥ , which ranks higher than 6 ♠ 5 ♠ 4 ♠ 3 ♠ 2 ♠ . Straight flush hands that differ by suit alone , such as 7 6 5 4 3 and 7 ♠ 6 ♠ 5 ♠ 4 ♠ 3 ♠ , are of equal rank .
