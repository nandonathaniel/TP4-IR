Some of these compounds have found use in chemical synthesis as oxidizing agents ; XeF , in particular , is commercially available and can be used as a fluorinating agent . As of 2007 , about five hundred compounds of xenon bonded to other elements have been identified , including organoxenon compounds ( containing xenon bonded to carbon ) , and xenon bonded to nitrogen , chlorine , gold , mercury , and xenon itself . Compounds of xenon bound to boron , hydrogen , bromine , iodine , beryllium , sulphur , titanium , copper , and silver have also been observed but only at low temperatures in noble gas matrices , or in supersonic noble gas jets .
