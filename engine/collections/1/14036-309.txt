Due to the predicted short half - lives , the GSI team used new `` fast '' electronics capable of registering decay events within microseconds . No ununennium atoms were identified , implying a limiting cross-section of 70 fb . The predicted actual cross-section is around 40 fb , which is at the limits of current technology .
