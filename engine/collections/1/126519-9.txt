Throughout recorded history , the rich have been able to afford a varied diet including meat , vegetables and fruit , but for poor people , meat was a luxury and the food they ate was very dull , typically comprising mainly some staple product made from rice , rye , barley , wheat , millet or maize . The addition of vegetable matter provided some variety to the diet . The staple diet of the Aztecs in Central America was maize and they cultivated tomatoes , avocados , beans , peppers , pumpkins , squashes , peanuts , and amaranth seeds to supplement their tortillas and porridge . In Peru , the Incas subsisted on maize in the lowlands and potatoes at higher altitudes . They also used seeds from quinoa , supplementing their diet with peppers , tomatoes , and avocados .
