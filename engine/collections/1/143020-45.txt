The period of success began when George Harris replaced Lew Holmes as president of the club , after the 1964 season . Harris then signed Melbourne legend Ron Barassi serve as coach from 1965 . Barassi was a six - time premiership player and two - time premiership captain at Melbourne during its most successful era , and at the age of 28 was still one of the biggest names in the game . His shift to Carlton remains one of the biggest player transfers in the game 's history . Also contributing to Carlton 's success was the strength of the Bendigo Football League , to which Carlton gained recruitment access through the VFL 's country zoning arrangements .
