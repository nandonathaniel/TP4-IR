Natural convection will be more likely and more rapid with a greater variation in density between the two fluids , a larger acceleration due to gravity that drives the convection or a larger distance through the convecting medium . Natural convection will be less likely and less rapid with more rapid diffusion ( thereby diffusing away the thermal gradient that is causing the convection ) or a more viscous ( sticky ) fluid .
