The long s was derived from the old Roman cursive medial s . When the distinction between majuscule ( uppercase ) and minuscule ( lowercase ) letter forms became established , toward the end of the eighth century , it developed a more vertical form . During this period , it was occasionally used at the end of a word , a practice that quickly died but that was occasionally revived in Italian printing between about 1465 and 1480 . Thus , the general rule that the long s `` never occurred at the end of a word '' is not strictly correct , although the exceptions are rare and archaic . The double s in the middle of a word was also written with a long s and a short s , as in Mississippi . In German typography , the rules are more complicated : short s also appears at the end of each component within a compound word , and there are more detailed rules and practices for special cases .
