Clad in typical frontier garb , leather breeches , moccasins , fur cap , and hunting shirt , and girded by a belt from which hung a hunting knife and a shot pouch -- all homemade -- the pioneer presented a unique appearance . In a short time he opened in the woods a patch , or clearing , on which he grew corn , wheat , flax , tobacco and other products , even fruit .
