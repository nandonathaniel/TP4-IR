Gene is an emoji that lives in Textopolis , a digital city inside the phone of his user Alex . He is the son of two meh emojis named Mel and Mary , and is able to make multiple expressions despite his parents ' upbringing . His parents are hesitant of him going to work , but Gene insists so that he can feel useful . Upon receiving a text from his crush Addie , Alex decides to send her an emoji . When Gene is selected , he panics , makes a confusing expression , and wrecks the text center . Gene is called in by Smiler , a smiley emoji and leader of the text center , who concludes that Gene is a `` malfunction '' and therefore must be deleted . Gene is chased by bots , but is rescued by Hi - 5 , a once popular emoji who has since lost his fame due to lack of use . He tells Gene that he can be fixed if they find a hacker , and Hi - 5 accompanies him so that he can reclaim his fame .
