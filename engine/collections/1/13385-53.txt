`` I lived ( in Tunisia ) for two and a half years . It made a real impression . I was present for large , violent student riots that preceded by several weeks what happened in May in France . This was March 1968 . The unrest lasted a whole year : strikes , courses suspended , arrests . And in March , a general strike by the students . The police came into the university , beat up the students , wounded several of them seriously , and started making arrests ... I have to say that I was tremendously impressed by those young men and women who took terrible risks by writing or distributing tracts or calling for strikes , the ones who really risked losing their freedom ! It was a political experience for me . '' -- Michel Foucault , 1983
