A regular passenger and car ferry service , lasting about 90 minutes , crosses the Strait of Belle Isle , connecting the province 's island of Newfoundland with the region of Labrador on the mainland . The ferry MV Apollo travels from St. Barbe , Newfoundland on the Great Northern Peninsula to the port town of Blanc - Sablon , Quebec , located on the provincial border and beside the town of L'Anse - au - Clair , Labrador . The MV Sir Robert Bond once provided seasonal ferry service between Lewisporte on the island and the towns of Cartwright and Happy Valley - Goose Bay in Labrador , but has not run since the completion of the Trans Labrador highway in 2010 , allowing access from Blanc - Sablon , Quebec to major parts of Labrador . Several smaller ferries connect numerous other coastal towns and offshore island communities around the island of Newfoundland and up the Labrador coast as far north as Nain .
