f d e t e c t e d = f r e s t ( 1 − v c cos ⁡ φ ) / 1 − v 2 / c 2 ( \ displaystyle f_ ( \ mathrm ( detected ) ) = f_ ( \ mathrm ( rest ) ) ( \ left ( 1 - ( \ frac ( v ) ( c ) ) \ cos \ phi \ right ) / ( \ sqrt ( 1 - ( v ^ ( 2 ) ) / ( c ^ ( 2 ) ) ) ) ) ) as deduced by Einstein ( 1905 ) . For φ = 90 ° ( cosφ = 0 ) this reduces to f = f γ . This lower frequency from the moving source can be attributed to the time dilation effect and is often called the transverse Doppler effect and was predicted by relativity .
