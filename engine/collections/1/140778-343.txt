However , the Steelers dominated the third quarter , forcing three turnovers and holding the Ravens to negative yardage . Less than five minutes into the quarter , Rice lost a fumble while being tackled by Ryan Clark , and linebacker LaMarr Woodley recovered it on the Baltimore 23 - yard line . After a 14 - yard run by Mendenhall , Roethlisberger threw a 9 - yard touchdown pass to tight end Heath Miller . Then after an exchange of punts , Clark intercepted a pass from Flacco and returned it 17 yards to the Ravens 25 - yard line . Mendenhall started the drive with a 13 - yard screen , and Roethlisberger finished it with an 8 - yard third down touchdown pass to Hines Ward , tying the game at 21 . Just two plays after the ensuing kickoff , Flacco fumbled a snap and Steelers lineman Brett Keisel recovered it at the Baltimore 23 . This time the Steelers were unable to get a touchdown , as Roethlisberger was sacked by Suggs on third down and six after driving inside the 10 - yard line , but Suisham kicked a 35 - yard field goal to give Pittsburgh their first lead with 12 : 15 left in regulation .
