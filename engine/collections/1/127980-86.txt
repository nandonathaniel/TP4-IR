The Portuguese Penal Code ( article 323 ) also forbids the desecration of foreign symbols : `` Who publicly , by means of words , gestures or print publication , or by other means of public communication , insults the official flag or other symbol of sovereignty of a foreign State or of an international organization of which Portugal is a member shall be punished with up to one year imprisonment or a fine of up to 120 days . '' This article applies under two conditions ( article 324 ) : that Portugal maintains diplomatic relations with the insulted country , and that there is reciprocity ( i.e. , that the insulted country would also punish any insult against Portuguese symbols of sovereignty , should they occur there ) .
