Marsupials reached Australia via Antarctica about 50 mya , shortly after Australia had split off . This suggests a single dispersion event of just one species , most likely a relative to South America 's monito del monte ( a microbiothere , the only New World australidelphian ) . This progenitor may have rafted across the widening , but still narrow , gap between Australia and Antarctica . In Australia , they radiated into the wide variety seen today . Modern marsupials appear to have reached the islands of New Guinea and Sulawesi relatively recently via Australia . A 2010 analysis of retroposon insertion sites in the nuclear DNA of a variety of marsupials has confirmed all living marsupials have South American ancestors . The branching sequence of marsupial orders indicated by the study puts Didelphimorphia in the most basal position , followed by Paucituberculata , then Microbiotheria , and ending with the radiation of Australian marsupials . This indicates that Australidelphia arose in South America , and reached Australia after Microbiotheria split off .
