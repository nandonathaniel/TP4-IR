While at a S.H.I.E.L.D. Academy Ward , Fitz , Simmons , and Skye investigate an attack upon Seth , a popular cadet , with an `` ice machine '' that can freeze people and their surroundings . Another ice machine soon freezes cadet Donnie Gill , though the agents are able to save him . While the rest of the team interrogates the other cadets , Fitz befriends Donnie , seeing much of himself in him , and helps him solve a problem with a new power source . Meanwhile , Coulson and May go to Mexico City to find a former agent named Richard Lumley , who tells them of a mission 24 years earlier involving Skye , an 0 - 8 - 4 with apparent superhuman abilities . The team deduces that the cadets are building a bigger ice machine for Quinn , and with the better power source , Seth and Donnie give Quinn a demonstration , creating a massive ice storm . Though the team apprehends Donnie , Seth is killed by the storm , and Donnie gains apparent cryokinetic abilities . Later , Coulson calls Quinn , who has connections to the Clairvoyant .
