While the funding process was underway , an existing city of Columbia site located on the Congaree River offered an opportunity to be a pilot project for the Three Rivers Greenway . The Alliance was asked to design and permit for construction by a general contractor this component . This approximately one - half - mile segment of the system was opened in November 1998 . It is complete with 8 - foot ( 2.4 m ) wide concrete pathways , vandal - proof lighting , trash receptacles , water fountains , picnic benches , overlooks , bank fishing access , canoe / kayak access , a public restroom and parking . These set the standards for the common elements in the rest of the system . Eventually , pathways will run from Granby to the Riverbanks Zoo . Boaters , sportspeople , and fisherpeople will have access to the area , and additional recreational uses are being planned along the miles of riverfront .
