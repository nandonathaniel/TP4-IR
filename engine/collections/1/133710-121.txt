Although Gandhi continued professing socialist beliefs , the Sixth Five Year Plan was markedly different from the years of Garibi Hatao . Populist programs and policies were replaced by pragmatism . There was an emphasis on tightening public expenditures , greater efficiency of the state - owned enterprises ( SOE ) , which Gandhi qualified as a `` sad thing '' , and in stimulating the private sector through deregulation and liberation of the capital market . The government subsequently launched Operation Forward in 1982 , the first cautious attempt at reform . The Sixth Plan went on to become the most successful of the Five Year plans yet ; showing an average growth of 5.7 % over 1980 -- 85 .
