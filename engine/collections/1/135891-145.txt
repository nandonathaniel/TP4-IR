The relationship between the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments was addressed by Justice Field in Wong Wing v. United States ( 1896 ) . He observed with respect to the phrase `` within its jurisdiction '' : `` The term ' person , ' used in the Fifth Amendment , is broad enough to include any and every human being within the jurisdiction of the republic . A resident , alien born , is entitled to the same protection under the laws that a citizen is entitled to . He owes obedience to the laws of the country in which he is domiciled , and , as a consequence , he is entitled to the equal protection of those laws ... The contention that persons within the territorial jurisdiction of this republic might be beyond the protection of the law was heard with pain on the argument at the bar -- in face of the great constitutional amendment which declares that no State shall deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws .
