If one wishes to strip people of their illusions in order to lead them to something more true , here as always you ( the esthete ) are `` at your service in every way . '' On the whole you are tireless in tracking down illusions in order to smash them to pieces . You talk so sensibly , with such experience , that anyone who does not know you better must believe that you are a steady man . But you have by no means arrived at what is true . You stopped with destroying the illusion , and since you did it in every conceivable direction , you actually have worked your way into a new illusion - that one can stop with this . Yes , my friend , you are living in an illusion , and you are achieving nothing . Here I have spoken the word that has always had such a strange effect on you . Achieve - `` So who is achieving something ? That is precisely one of the most dangerous illusions . I do not busy myself in the world at all ; I amuse myself the best I can , and I am particularly amused by those people who believe that they are achieving , and is it not indescribably funny that a person believes that ? I refuse to burden my life with such grandiose pretensions . '' SÃ¸ren Kierkegaard , Either / Or Part II , Hong , p. 78 - 79
