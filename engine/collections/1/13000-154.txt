In response to the season , Bianco from USA Today commented : `` Happily , it now seems to have landed on solid ground . '' Also of the seventh season , Entertainment Weekly 's Jennifer Armstrong said : `` It 's in the shooting 's emotional reverberations that the show is regenerating after the past few hit - and - miss seasons , '' whereas Verne Gay of Newsday commented : `` Unfortunately , they 've settled on far - too - easy and facile answers for the most part . '' HitFix gave a positive review saying that , `` season 7 overall has been one of the show 's strongest ever . '' and added , `` There was a time when Grey 's Anatomy was this show where I suffered through a lot of stuff that made me cringe to get to those genius melodrama moments it could do so well . Over the last couple of years , it 's evolved into a show that 's much more consistent in tone , where it may not move me as often as it did in the early years but also very rarely makes me question my reasons for watching . '' Speaking of season eight , Entertainment Weekly 's Mandi Bierly called it a `` so - so season '' , and Lesley Goldberg of The Hollywood Reporter called it `` emotional '' . Also acknowledging the fan base Verne Gay of Newsday wrote `` Grey 's has had a good season and has an intensely loyal fan base to prove it . '' regarding the 8th season .
