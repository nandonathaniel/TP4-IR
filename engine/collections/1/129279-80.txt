Manco Inca then retreated to the mountains of Vilcabamba and founded the Neo-Inca State , where he and his successors ruled for another 36 years , sometimes raiding the Spanish or inciting revolts against them . In 1572 the last Inca stronghold was discovered , and the last ruler , TÃºpac Amaru , Manco 's son , was captured and executed , bringing the Inca empire to an end .
