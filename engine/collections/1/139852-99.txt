The Icelandic national bard and possibly most important source of Norse Mythology , Snorri Sturluson , identifies Troy with Åsgard . About it were 12 kingdoms and 12 chiefs . One of them , Múnón , married Priam 's daughter , Tróán , and had by her a son , Trór , to be pronounced Thor in Old Norse . Similarly the Áss Vidarr is identified with Aeneas .
