Viswanatha Nayak was formally crowned as the Madura king by Acyutadeva Maharaya . Following his appointment , Viswanatha is said to have set himself immediately to strengthening his capital and improving the administration of his dominions . He was supported by his able general Ariyanatha Mudaliar who led Viswantha Nayak 's army and had become second in command taking power along with the latter . He demolished the Pandya rampart and ditch which at that time surrounded merely the walls of Madurai 's great temple , and erected in their place an extensive double - walled fortress defended by 72 bastions ; and he constructed channels from upper waters of the Vaigai river to supply the kingdom with water . Perhaps the Peranai and Chittanai dams owe their origins to him .
