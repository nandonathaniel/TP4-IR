Jefferson 's collection was unique in that it was the working collection of a scholar , not a gentleman 's collection for display . His original collection was organized into a scheme based on Francis Bacon 's organization of knowledge . Specifically , he grouped his books into Memory , Reason , and Imagination , which broke down into 44 more subdivisions . The Library followed Jefferson 's organization scheme until the late 19th century , when librarian Herbert Putnam began work on a more flexible Library of Congress Classification structure that now applies to more than 138 million items .
