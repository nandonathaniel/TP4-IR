Theo referred to these pictorial elements in a letter to Vincent dated 22 October 1889 : `` I clearly sense what preoccupies you in the new canvases like the village in the moonlight ( The Starry Night ) or the mountains , but I feel that the search for style takes away the real sentiment of things . '' Vincent responded in early November , `` Despite what you say in your previous letter , that the search for style often harms other qualities , the fact is that I feel myself greatly driven to seek style , if you like , but I mean by that a more manly and more deliberate drawing . If that will make me more like Bernard or Gauguin , I ca n't do anything about it . But am inclined to believe that in the long run you 'd get used to it . '' And later in the same letter , he wrote , `` I know very well that the studies drawn with long , sinuous lines from the last consignment were n't what they ought to become , however I dare urge you to believe that in landscapes one will continue to mass things by means of a drawing style that seeks to express the entanglement of the masses .
