Corporal Himmelstoss ( spelled Himmelstoß in some editions ) was a postman before enlisting in the war . He is a power - hungry corporal with special contempt for Paul and his friends , taking sadistic pleasure in punishing the minor infractions of his trainees during their basic training in preparation for their deployment . Paul later figures that the training taught by Himmelstoss made them `` hard , suspicious , pitiless , and tough '' but most importantly it taught them comradeship . However , Bäumer and his comrades have a chance to get back at Himmelstoss because of his punishments , mercilessly whipping him on the night before they board trains to go to the front .
