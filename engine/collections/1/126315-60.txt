( The station ) is further graced by a pedestal on which stands a curious old locomotive rejoicing in the name of `` Billy '' . The true early history of `` Billy '' is well - nigh veiled in the mists of antiquity , and it was only by diligent enquiry that Mr Holliday , the Station Master , was able to learn a little of her antecedents . That `` she '' was constructed as far back as 1824 -- 1826 is however certain , and on that score alone she is entitled to an introduction to such of the readers of the Railway Magazine as have until now been unaware of her existence . For about fifty - five years ( until 1879 ) she performed good service , first at the Springwell , and latterly at the Killingworth colliery , from which place she actually steamed into Newcastle in 1881 to celebrate George Stephenson 's Centenary .
