When a candidate wishes to embrace the monastic life , he will enter the monastery of his choice as a guest and ask to be received by the Hegumen ( Abbot ) . After a period of at least three days the Hegumen may at his discretion clothe the candidate as a novice . There is no formal ceremony for the clothing of a novice ; he ( or she ) would simply be given the Podraznik , belt and skoufos .
