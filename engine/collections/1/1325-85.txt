Bacon then demanded a military commission but Berkeley refused . Bacon and his supporters surrounded the statehouse and threatened to start shooting the Burgesses if Berkeley did not acknowledge Bacon as `` General of all forces against the Indians '' . Berkeley eventually acceded , and then left Jamestown . He attempted a coup a month later but was unsuccessful . In September , however , Berkeley was successful and Bacon dug in for a siege which resulted in his burning Jamestown to the ground on September 19 , 1676 . Bacon died of the flux and lice on October 26 , 1676 and his body is believed to have been burned .
