Red is initially pleasant to Piper until she unknowingly insults her cooking , and in response Red punishes her by starvation . Piper eventually repairs their relationship by making a lotion to help soothe Red 's injured back . Red also has an odd obsession with a chicken that is allegedly seen on the prison grounds from time to time , as she wants to cook `` real food '' and also wants to absorb its `` power . '' Towards the end of the first season , she is decommissioned from the kitchen by Caputo after he discovers Mendez 's drug smuggling operation , which is blamed on Red . Caputo assigns Gloria as the new master chef , and the kitchen is then run by the Latina inmates . In an attempt to take Gloria and her `` girls '' out of the kitchen , Red sabotaged one of the ovens , causing Gina to get injured , thus straining her relationship with her friends severely . Red eventually becomes Piper 's new roommate and befriends her , while at the same time she attempts to come to terms with her loss of friends and status , in the process befriending the `` Golden Girls '' -- the older women in the prison .
