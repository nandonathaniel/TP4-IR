Sheldon has been writing to the reclusive scientist Dr. Wolcott ( Peter MacNicol ) who invites Sheldon to visit him in his completely isolated mountain cabin . The women quickly ask Leonard , Raj and Howard to tag along with him , making this his bachelor party , despite Sheldon 's assertions that it should n't be called such . Wolcott has a brilliant mind but his behavior is very strange to the guys . He tells Sheldon he cut off all contact with others to focus on science . Though Sheldon enjoys the science , he decides that he does n't want to live like Wolcott because of his friends and Amy . The guys leave to avoid Wolcott , whose theories about time make him doubt whether the guys were ever there . Meanwhile , Penny and Bernadette throw Amy a quilting bee for her bachelorette party , which she quickly finds boring . When Amy tells them she wants a night full of bad decisions as she earlier implied , they go to a bar where Amy drinks a few shots and passes out in twelve minutes . When she wakes up back at the apartment hungover and disappointed , the women lie and reassure her she had a wild time , involving her drunkenly riverdancing .
