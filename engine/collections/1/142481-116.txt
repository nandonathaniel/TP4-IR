Researchers sometimes practice scientific data archiving , such as in compliance with the policies of government funding agencies and scientific journals . In these cases , detailed records of their experimental procedures , raw data , statistical analyses and source code can be preserved in order to provide evidence of the methodology and practice of the procedure and assist in any potential future attempts to reproduce the result . These procedural records may also assist in the conception of new experiments to test the hypothesis , and may prove useful to engineers who might examine the potential practical applications of a discovery .
