Poe scholar Richard P. Benton has stated his belief that `` Poe 's protagonist is an Englished version of the French Montrésor '' and has argued forcefully that Poe 's model for Montresor `` was Claude de Bourdeille , comte de Montrésor ( Count of Montrésor ) , the 17th - century political conspirator in the entourage of King Louis XIII 's weak - willed brother , Gaston d'Orléans '' . The `` noted intriguer and memoir - writer '' was first linked to `` The Cask of Amontillado '' by Poe scholar Burton R. Pollin .
