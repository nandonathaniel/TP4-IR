Wellington contains many iconic sculptures and structures , such as the Bucket Fountain in Cuba Street and Invisible City by Anton Parsons on Lambton Quay . Kinetic sculptures have been commissioned , such as the Zephyrometer . This 26 - metre orange spike built for movement by artist Phil Price has been described as `` tall , soaring and elegantly simple '' , which `` reflects the swaying of the yacht masts in the Evans Bay Marina behind it '' and `` moves like the needle on the dial of a nautical instrument , measuring the speed of the sea or wind or vessel .
