The retired numbers were displayed behind the old Yankee Stadium 's left field fence and in front of the opposing team 's bullpen , forming a little alley that connects Monument Park to the left field stands . When the franchise moved across the street to the new stadium , the numbers were incorporated into Monument Park that sits place in center field between both bullpens . The 21 numbers are placed on the wall in chronological order , beginning with Lou Gehrig 's number 4 . This was retired soon after Gehrig left baseball on July 4 , 1939 , the same day he gave his famous farewell speech . His was the first number retired in Major League Baseball history . Beneath the numbers are plaques with the names of the players and a descriptive paragraph .
