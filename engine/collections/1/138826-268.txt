At the height of its power , during the 14th century BCE , Mitanni had outposts centered on its capital , Washukanni , whose location has been determined by archaeologists to be on the headwaters of the Khabur River . Their sphere of influence is shown in Hurrian place names , personal names and the spread through Syria and the Levant of a distinct pottery type . Eventually , Mitanni succumbed to Hittite and later Assyrian attacks , and was reduced to the status of a province of the Middle Assyrian Empire .
