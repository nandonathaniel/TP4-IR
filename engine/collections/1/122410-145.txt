In 1999 , a DSM -- 5 Research Planning Conference ; sponsored jointly by APA and the National Institute of Mental Health ( NIMH ) , was held to set the research priorities . Research Planning Work Groups produced `` white papers '' on the research needed to inform and shape the DSM - 5 and the resulting work and recommendations were reported in an APA monograph and peer - reviewed literature . There were six workgroups , each focusing on a broad topic : Nomenclature , Neuroscience and Genetics , Developmental Issues and Diagnosis , Personality and Relational Disorders , Mental Disorders and Disability , and Cross-Cultural Issues . Three additional white papers were also due by 2004 concerning gender issues , diagnostic issues in the geriatric population , and mental disorders in infants and young children . The white papers have been followed by a series of conferences to produce recommendations relating to specific disorders and issues , with attendance limited to 25 invited researchers .
