The first step in the emergence of life may have been chemical reactions that produced many of the simpler organic compounds , including nucleobases and amino acids , that are the building blocks of life . An experiment in 1953 by Stanley Miller and Harold Urey showed that such molecules could form in an atmosphere of water , methane , ammonia and hydrogen with the aid of sparks to mimic the effect of lightning . Although atmospheric composition was probably different from that used by Miller and Urey , later experiments with more realistic compositions also managed to synthesize organic molecules . Computer simulations show that extraterrestrial organic molecules could have formed in the protoplanetary disk before the formation of the Earth .
