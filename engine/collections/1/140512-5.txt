Geometrically , a periodic function can be defined as a function whose graph exhibits translational symmetry . Specifically , a function f is periodic with period P if the graph of f is invariant under translation in the x - direction by a distance of P . This definition of periodic can be extended to other geometric shapes and patterns , such as periodic tessellations of the plane .
