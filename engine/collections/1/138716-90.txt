In Shadowrun , the orks are one subspecies of Homo sapiens among others living on post-2011 Earth . They emerged during the Unexplained Genetic Expression in 2021 , as either young humans transformed into orks , or babies that were born as orks from human parents . They are categorized as Homo sapiens robustus and are considered to be metahumans , like trolls , elves , and dwarfs . They are able to interbreed with humans and other fellow metahumans . Despite this , their offspring ( like the offspring of all inter-racial metahuman matings in Shadowrun ) is of the race of only one of their parents . Being an ork is due to the expression of a gene , and thus half - breeds do not exist . They grow much faster than humans , reach maturity at 12 , and give birth to a litter of about four children , though six to eight are not uncommon . Their average life - expectancy is about 35 to 40 years . They are physically larger and stronger than humans and their mental capacities are considered slightly inferior , though they are still not as dull as the average troll .
