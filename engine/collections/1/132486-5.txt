Different empirical scales may not be compatible with each other , except for small regions of temperature overlap . If an alcohol thermometer and a mercury thermometer have same two fixed points , namely the freezing and boiling point of water , their reading will not agree with each other except at the fixed points , as the linear 1 : 1 relationship of expansion between any two thermometric substances may not be guaranteed .
