Some scholars and politicians like Robert A. Taft , at the time U.S. Senator from Ohio , asserted that the Nuremberg Trials following World War II were based on ex post facto law , because the Allies did not negotiate the London Charter , defining crimes against humanity and creating the International Military Tribunal , until well after the acts charged . Others , including the International Military Tribunal , argued that the London Charter merely restated and provided jurisdiction to prosecute offenses that were already made unlawful by the Kellogg - Briand Pact , the Covenant of the League of Nations , and the various Hague Conventions .
