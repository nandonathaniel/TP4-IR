In years when 8 December falls on Sunday , the Solemnity of the Immaculate Conception is normally transferred to 9 December , as it is outranked by the Second Sunday of Advent . In this case , the precept to attend mass , however , is abrogated by the transfer . However , in the 1962 extraordinary form of the Roman Rite , the Immaculate Conception outranks the Second Sunday of Advent and so remains on 8 December .
