People with ALS who have difficulty speaking may benefit from working with a speech - language pathologist . These health professionals can teach people adaptive strategies such as techniques to help them speak louder and more clearly . As ALS progresses , speech - language pathologists can recommend the use of augmentative and alternative communication such as voice amplifiers , speech - generating devices ( or voice output communication devices ) or low - tech communication techniques such as head mounted laser pointers , alphabet boards or yes / no signals .
