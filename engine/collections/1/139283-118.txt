The first player moves the number of spaces along the track according to a dial spin . If the player lands on a pink star , his turn ends . If he lands on a yellow star , he draws a card and follows its instruction . If he draws a picture card , he retains it face down at his place . If a player spins a six , he is given the choice of moving six spaces or taking a magic wand . He may play the wand at any time during the game and in doing so draws two cards , following their instructions . A player must hold three different picture cards before entering the Path of Happiness . If he does not hold three picture cards , he continues around the Deep Sleep circle until he acquires the required three picture cards . Should a player land on a purple Maleficent space , that player returns one of his picture cards to the deck .
