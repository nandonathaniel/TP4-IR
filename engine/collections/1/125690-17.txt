Bloom 's critique of contemporary social movements at play in universities or society at large is derived from his classical and philosophical orientation . For Bloom , the failure of contemporary liberal education leads to the sterile social and sexual habits of modern students , and to their inability to fashion a life for themselves beyond the mundane offerings touted as success . Bloom argues that commercial pursuits had become more highly valued than love , the philosophic quest for truth , or the civilized pursuits of honor and glory .
