Storm and sanitary sewers were necessarily developed along with the growth of cities . By the 1840s the luxury of indoor plumbing , which mixes human waste with water and flushes it away , eliminated the need for cesspools . Odor was considered the big problem in waste disposal and to address it , sewage could be drained to a lagoon , or `` settled '' and the solids removed , to be disposed of separately . This process is now called `` primary treatment '' and the settled solids are called `` sludge . ''
