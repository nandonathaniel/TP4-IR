Each San Francisco band had its characteristic sound , but enough commonalities existed that there was a regional identity . By 1967 , fresh and adventurous improvisation during live performance ( which many heard as being epitomized by the Grateful Dead and by the `` cross-talk '' guitar work of Moby Grape ) was one characteristic of the San Francisco Sound . A louder , more prominent role for the electric bass -- typically with a melodic or semi-melodic approach , and using a plush , pervasive tone -- was another feature . This questing bass quality has been wryly characterized as a `` roving '' ( rather than the conventional `` stay - at - home '' ) style . In jazz it had been exuberantly pioneered by numerous musicians -- and such bassists as Charles Mingus , Scott LaFaro , and Steve Swallow had taken it into very exploratory places . A musician who was a leading example of this , Jack Casady of Jefferson Airplane ( and the offshoot Hot Tuna ) pioneered the approach , perhaps best represented on the album Bless Its Pointed Little Head . Phil Lesh , bassist with the Grateful Dead , furthered this sound . Lesh had developed his style on the foundation of having studied classical , brass - band , jazz , and modernist music on the violin and later the trumpet .
