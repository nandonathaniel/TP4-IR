In June , a seaplane carrier HMS Ben - my - Chree arrived and the Allied air effort increased from a squadron to No. 3 Wing RNAS . The 52nd ( Lowland ) Division also landed at Helles in preparation for the Battle of Gully Ravine , which began on 28 June and achieved a local success , which advanced the British line along the left ( Aegean ) flank of the battlefield . Sanders credited the defence to two Ottoman officers , Faik Pasa and Albay Refet . On 30 June , the French commander , Henri Gouraud who had earlier replaced Albert d'Amade , was wounded and replaced by his divisional commander , Maurice Bailloud . Between 1 and 5 July , the Ottomans counter-attacked the new British line several times but failed to regain the lost ground . Ottoman casualties for the period were estimated at 14,000 men . On 12 July , two fresh brigades from the 52nd Division attacked at the centre of the line along Achi Baba Nullah ( Bloody Valley ) , gained very little ground and lost 2,500 casualties out of 7,500 men ; the Royal Naval Division had 600 casualties and French losses were 800 men . Ottoman losses were about 9,000 casualties and 600 prisoners .
