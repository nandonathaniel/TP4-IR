Sabotaging a hook takes a significantly shorter amount of time than repairing a generator but is considerably louder . To sabotage a hook , survivors must be equipped with a ' tool box ' or have the Saboteur perk active . Skill checks are more common during this action than when repairing a generator . Failing a sabotage skill check makes a loud banging sound , also setting back progress and alerting the killer .
