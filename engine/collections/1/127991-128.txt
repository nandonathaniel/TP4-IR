As the preceding examples show , the record of earthquake prediction has been disappointing . The optimism of the 1970s that routine prediction of earthquakes would be `` soon '' , perhaps within ten years , was coming up disappointingly short by the 1990s , and many scientists began wondering why . By 1997 it was being positively stated that earthquakes can not be predicted , which led to a notable debate in 1999 on whether prediction of individual earthquakes is a realistic scientific goal .
