The first - century Roman historian Pliny the Elder discounted Sirens as pure fable , `` although Dinon , the father of Clearchus , a celebrated writer , asserts that they exist in India , and that they charm men by their song , and , having first lulled them to sleep , tear them to pieces . '' In his notebooks , Leonardo da Vinci wrote of the Siren , `` The siren sings so sweetly that she lulls the mariners to sleep ; then she climbs upon the ships and kills the sleeping mariners . ''
