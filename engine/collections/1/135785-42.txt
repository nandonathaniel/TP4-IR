The form of the periodic table is closely related to the electron configuration of the atoms of the elements . For example , all the elements of group 2 have an electron configuration of ( E ) ns ( where ( E ) is an inert gas configuration ) , and have notable similarities in their chemical properties . In general , the periodicity of the periodic table in terms of periodic table blocks is clearly due to the number of electrons ( 2 , 6 , 10 , 14 ... ) needed to fill s , p , d , and f subshells .
