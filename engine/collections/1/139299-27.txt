Crystal Quagmire ( voiced by Alex Borstein in `` Fore , Father '' , Allison Janney in `` Quagmire 's Mom '' ) -- The mother of Glenn and Brenda Quagmire and the ex-wife of Dan . Her first appearance was in `` Fore Father '' where she is seen in a flashback breastfeeding Glenn . When facing prison time for statutory rape in `` Quagmire 's Mom '' , Quagmire places the blame for his behavior on living with his sexually promiscuous mom during his trial where her actions are seen during a flashback sequence . She arrives at his trial where a lot of the generic men attending the trial recognize her as noted by Mayor Adam West . Crystal admits her faults , but claims to have found religion and asks that he be released to her custody . The judge presiding over the trial rejects her request and sentences Quagmire to twenty years in prison . She tries to get him to find solace in God as well , but he rejects her words . Stewie even asked Crystal if she is aware of what Dan has been through . Just before he enters the prison , the judge arrives and announces that he has commuted Quagmire 's sentence , thanks to his mother 's `` talents '' and that new DNA evidence has turned up . He is surprised that despite her new religious life , she would do such a thing , but she admits that she would do anything to help him .
