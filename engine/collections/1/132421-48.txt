In March 2015 Tesla Motors announced that it will introduce its Autopilot technology by mid 2015 through a software update for the cars equipped with the systems that allow autonomous driving . Some industry experts have raised questions about the legal status of autonomous driving in the U.S. and whether Model S owner would violate current state regulations when using the autopilot function . The few states that have passed laws allowing autonomous cars on the road limit their use for testing purposes , not the use by the general public . Also , there are questions about the liability for autonomous cars in case there is a mistake . A Tesla spokesman said there is `` nothing in our autopilot system that is in conflict with current regulations . '' `` We are not getting rid of the pilot . This is about releasing the driver from tedious tasks so they can focus and provide better input . '' Google 's director of self - driving cars at the company said he does not think there is a regulatory block as far as the self - driving vehicle met crash - test and other safety standards . A spokesman for the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration ( NHTSA ) said that `` any autonomous vehicle would need to meet applicable federal motor vehicle safety standards '' and the NHTSA `` will have the appropriate policies and regulations in place to ensure the safety of this type of vehicles .
