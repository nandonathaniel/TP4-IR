For the second time , the King summoned Parlement away from Paris , where crowds of people cheered their every act from the street , this time to meet at Troyes , Champagne on 15 August . He did not personally appear . By messenger he and Parlement negotiated an agreement : the King withdrew the Stamp Tax and modified the Land Tax to exclude the lands of people of title in return for the assured registration of further loans . Parlement was allowed to return on 20 September . Encouraged , Lom√©nie , with the support of the King , went beyond the intent of the Parlement which was to grant specific loans . He proposed an Emprunt Successif ( Successive Loan ) until 1792 giving the King a blank cheque . When Parlement delayed the King resorted to a ruse ; he scheduled a Royal Hunt for 19 November . On that day at 11 : 00 AM the King and his peers noisily entered the session of Parlement dressed in hunting clothes . They would confer with each other and have the decisions registered immediately , they said .
