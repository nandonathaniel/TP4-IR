In 2009 , Herwig re-estimated the casualties for the battle . He wrote that the French Official History , Les armées françaises dans la grande guerre , gave 213,445 French casualties in September and assumed that c. 40 % occurred during the Battle of the Marne . Using the German Sanitätsberichte , Herwig recorded that from 1 -- 10 September , the 1st Army had 13,254 casualties , the 2nd Army had 10,607 casualties , the 3rd Army had 14,987 casualties , the 4th Army had 9,433 casualties , the 5th Army had 19,434 casualties , the 6th Army had 21,200 casualties and the 7th Army had 10,164 casualties . Herwig estimated that the five German Armies from Verdun to Paris had 67,700 casualties during the battle and assumed 85,000 casualties for the French . Herwig wrote that there were 1,701 British casualties ( the British Official History noted that these losses were incurred from 6 -- 10 September ) . Herwig estimated 300,000 casualties for all sides at the Marne but questioned whether isolating the battle was justified .
