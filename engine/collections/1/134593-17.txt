In the British Virgin Islands a company has separate legal personality from its members ( unlike , for example , a partnership registered under the Partnership Act , 1996 ) . The liability of the members of a company is limited to their shares or the amount of their guarantee . Similarly , directors or officers of a company are not normally liable for the company 's debts except insofar as they may otherwise be liable for their own conduct or actions . The primary circumstances where liability may be imposed upon directors in relation to their acts as directors are ( 1 ) where the company has no members , ( 2 ) where a person acts as a director despite being disqualified , ( 3 ) where the director authorises payment of an unlawful distribution which can not be recovered , ( 4 ) where the director is guilty of trading whilst insolvent , misfeasance or fraudulent trading , or ( 5 ) where the director undertakes personal responsibility or liability for certain actions .
