In the wake of independence in India and Pakistan in August 1947 and the subsequent bloodshed that followed the Security Council adopted resolution 39 ( 1948 ) in January 1948 in order to create the United Nations Commission for India and Pakistan ( UNCIP ) , with the purpose of mediating the dispute between India and Pakistan over Kashmir and the fighting related to it . This operation was non-interventionist in nature and was additionally tasked with supervision of a ceasefire signed by Pakistan and India in the state of Jammu and Kashmir . With the passage of the Karachi agreement in July 1949 , UNCIP would supervise a ceasefire line that would be mutually overseen by UN unarmed military observers and local commanders from each side in the dispute . UNCIP 's mission in the region continues to this day , now under the operational title of the United Nations Military Observer Group in India and Pakistan ( UNMOGIP ) .
