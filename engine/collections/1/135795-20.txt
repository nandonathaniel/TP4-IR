Though Arsenal finished fourth in Graham 's first season in charge ( having led the First Division for most of the winter ) , Arsenal did win the League Cup , in a campaign marked by comebacks . Arsenal faced Tottenham Hotspur in the semi-finals ; after losing 1 -- 0 at Highbury in the first leg and conceding a second goal in the first half of the second leg at White Hart Lane , Arsenal scored twice through Viv Anderson and Niall Quinn to draw 2 -- 2 on aggregate and force a replay ; in the replay Spurs went 1 -- 0 up , only for Arsenal to come back again with late goals from Ian Allinson and David Rocastle to win . The final against Liverpool was a repeat performance ; after Arsenal had gone 1 -- 0 down to an Ian Rush goal , two Charlie Nicholas goals brought Arsenal their first League Cup triumph and their first major trophy for eight years . However , UEFA voted to continue the ban on English clubs in European competitions that was imposed in the wake of the Heysel disaster in 1985 for a third season , and this meant that Arsenal were unable to compete in the 1987 -- 88 UEFA Cup .
