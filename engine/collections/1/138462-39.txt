Gearless wind turbines ( also called direct drive ) get rid of the gearbox completely . Instead , the rotor shaft is attached directly to the generator , which spins at the same speed as the blades . Enercon and EWT ( formerly known as Lagerwey ) have produced gearless wind turbines with separately electrically excited generators for many years , and Siemens produces a gearless `` inverted generator '' 3 MW model while developing a 6 MW model . To make up for a direct drive generator 's slower spinning rate , the diameter of the generator 's rotor is increased so that it can contain more magnets to create the required frequency and power .
