Water resources that span international boundaries are more likely to be a source of collaboration and cooperation than war . Scientists working at the International Water Management Institute have been investigating the evidence behind water war predictions . Their findings show that , while it is true there has been conflict related to water in a handful of international basins , in the rest of the world 's approximately 300 shared basins the record has been largely positive . This is exemplified by the hundreds of treaties in place guiding equitable water use between nations sharing water resources . The institutions created by these agreements can , in fact , be one of the most important factors in ensuring cooperation rather than conflict .
