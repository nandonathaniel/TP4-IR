This life cycle consists of several stages . The first stage is the submarine preshield stage , currently represented solely by Lōʻihi Seamount . During this stage , the volcano builds height through increasingly frequent eruptions . The sea 's pressure prevents explosive eruptions . The cold water quickly solidifies the lava , producing the pillow lava that is typical of underwater volcanic activity .
