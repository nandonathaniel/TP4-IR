The British - Indian Army intended to implement appropriate internal disciplinary action against its soldiers who had joined the INA , whilst putting to trial a selected group in order to preserve discipline in the Indian Army and to award punishment for criminal acts where these had occurred . As news of the army spread within India , it began to draw widespread sympathy support and admiration from Indians . Newspaper reports around November 1945 reported executions of INA troops , which worsened the already volatile situation . Increasingly violent confrontations broke out between the police and protesters at the mass rallies being held all over India , culminating in public riotings in support of the INA men . This public outcry defied traditional communal barriers of the subcontinent , representing a departure from the divisions between Hindus and Muslims seen elsewhere in the independence movement and campaign for Pakistan .
