In ancient Israel , the start of the ecclesiastical new year for the counting of months and festivals ( i.e. , Nisan ) was determined by reference to Passover . Passover is on 15 Nisan , ( Leviticus 23 : 4 -- 6 ) which corresponds to the full moon of Nisan . As Passover is a spring festival , it should fall on a full moon day around , and normally just after , the vernal ( northward ) equinox . If the twelfth full moon after the previous Passover is too early compared to the equinox , a leap month is inserted near the end of the previous year before the new year is set to begin . According to normative Judaism , the verses in Exodus 12 : 1 -- 2 require that the months be determined by a proper court with the necessary authority to sanctify the months . Hence the court , not the astronomy , has the final decision .
