The battle was famously described by Count Leo Tolstoy as `` a continuous slaughter which could be of no avail either to the French or the Russians '' in the culminating books X and XI of his novel War and Peace . The Imperial Russian Navy named a battleship after the battle . A huge panorama representing the battle was painted by Franz Roubaud for the centenary of Borodino and installed on the Poklonnaya Hill in Moscow to mark the 150th anniversary of the event . Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky also composed his 1812 Overture to commemorate the battle . In Russia , the Battle of Borodino is reenacted yearly on the first Sunday of September . On the battlefield itself , the Bagration fl√®ches are preserved ; a modest monument has been constructed in honour of the French soldiers who fell in the battle . There are also remnants of trenches from the seven - day battle fought at the same battlefield in 1941 between the Soviet and German forces ( which took fewer human lives than the one of 1812 ) .
