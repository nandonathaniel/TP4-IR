In 1969 , a new enclosed concourse was built parallel to the center pier . When it was completed , Piedmont , Eastern , and Delta moved in and the old center pier was demolished . The new concourse also had separate departure lounges , as well as restrooms and an enlarged baggage claim area . United 's flights continued to use the east pier , with an enclosed holding room added for waiting passengers . In 1973 , Eastern added two more gates to the end of its west concourse .
