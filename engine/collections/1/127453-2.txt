Disk partitioning or disk slicing is the creation of one or more regions on a hard disk or other secondary storage , so that an operating system can manage information in each region separately . Partitioning is typically the first step of preparing a newly manufactured disk , before any files or directories have been created . The disk stores the information about the partitions ' locations and sizes in an area known as the partition table that the operating system reads before any other part of the disk . Each partition then appears in the operating system as a distinct `` logical '' disk that uses part of the actual disk . System administrators use a program called a partition editor to create , resize , delete , and manipulate the partitions. When a hard drive is installed in a computer , it must be partitioned before you can format and use it . Partitioning a drive is when you divide the total storage of a drive into different pieces . These pieces are called partitions . Once a partition is created , it can then be formatted so that it can be used on a computer .
