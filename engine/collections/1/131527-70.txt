On 29 September 2015 , Channel 4 revamped its presentation for a fifth time ; the new branding downplayed the `` 4 '' logo from most on - air usage , in favour of using the shapes from the logo in various forms . Four new idents were filmed by Jonathan Glazer , which featured the shapes in various real - world scenes depicting the `` discovery '' and `` origins '' of the shapes . The full logo was still occasionally used , but primarily for off - air marketing . Channel 4 also commissioned two new corporate typefaces , `` Chadwick '' , and `` Horseferry '' ( a variation of Chadwick with the aforementioned shapes incorporated into its letter forms ) , for use across promotional material and on - air . In October 2017 , Channel 4 introduced a new series of idents continuing the theme , this time depicting the logo shapes as having formed an anthropomorphic `` giant '' character .
