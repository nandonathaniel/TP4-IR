CMYK or process color printing is contrasted with spot color printing , in which specific colored inks are used to generate the colors appearing on paper . Some printing presses are capable of printing with both four - color process inks and additional spot color inks at the same time . High - quality printed materials , such as marketing brochures and books , often include photographs requiring process - color printing , other graphic effects requiring spot colors ( such as metallic inks ) , and finishes such as varnish , which enhances the glossy appearance of the printed piece .
