Kaiseki , closely associated with tea ceremony ( chanoyu ) , is a high form of hospitality through cuisine . The style is minimalist , extolling the aesthetics of wabi - sabi . Like the tea ceremony , appreciation of the diningware and vessels is part of the experience . In the modern standard form , the first course consists of ichijū - sansai ( one soup , three dishes ) , followed by the serving of sake accompanied by dish ( es ) plated on a square wooden bordered tray of sorts called hassun ( 八 寸 ) . Sometimes another element called shiizakana ( 強 肴 ) is served to complement the sake , for guests who are heavier drinkers .
