Some supermarkets , including Wegmans , Giant Eagle , Giant , and Weis , have begun to sell alcohol within restaurants attached to the main supermarket building , but only under very specific conditions ( the restaurant must have a defined separation from the rest of the supermarket , a separate cashier , and seating for at least 30 patrons ) . Supermarket chain ShopRite has begun to attach Wine and Spirits stores to its stores . For a time , Sheetz obtained a liquor license for a restaurant attached to one of its convenience stores in Altoona . After several debates , the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania ruled that the store must sell beer to in - house customers as well as take - out . The 17th Street store now again sells beer and allows limited in store consumption .
