enrollment periods . In this case if the veteran is full - time , and his or her maximum BAH rate is $1500 per month , then he or she will receive ( 13 / 30 ) x $1500 = $650 for the end of the first period of enrollment , then the veteran will receive ( 10 / 30 ) x $1500 = $500 for the beginning of the second period of enrollment . Effectively , the change in break - pay means the veteran will receive $1150 per month for August instead of $1500 per month . This have a significant impact in December - January BAH payments since most Colleges have 2 - 4 week breaks .
