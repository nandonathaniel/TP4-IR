Around July 1 , 2015 Facebook started to automatically ban accounts that use the word `` moskal '' , which is a widely used historical slang term for people of Russia ( formerly Moskovia until 1721 ) , which may be seen offensive by some individuals . However , use of similar words such as `` khokhol '' , which are widely used by Russian nationalists against Ukrainians , as well as insulting uses of `` ukrop '' ( literally dill ) , were not prosecuted . In an experiment , journalist Max Kononenko has posted the poem `` Моя родословная '' by Alexander Pushkin for this account to be banned automatically within minutes . Posts of vice minister of Roskomnadzor , Max Ksenzov , were similarly automatically deleted . Ksenzov has accused Facebook of censorship and double standards and has removed his account in protest .
