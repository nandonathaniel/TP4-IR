Susan ( Tiffany Thornton ) -- Susan is another one of Justin 's academic friends . Alex grows fond of Zach ( his name changed to Zeke later on ) and Susan and tries to be their friend , making Justin jealous because he was friends with them first . When Susan invites Alex to watch a movie with them , Alex finds out that she is under the age restriction and uses magic to get into the movie , literally . Though she is Justin 's friend , she does n't seem to be very bright , as she told Alex she 's gon na follow in a celebrity 's footsteps of growing up on a farm , not realizing she is a little too late for that ( as she 's already a teenager ) . She also failed to realize Alex was physically in the movie , as she and Zeke ( then known as Zack ) came out of the movie telling Justin , weirded out , that there 's a girl in the movie who looks and sounds just like Alex and was even wearing the same clothes as her .
