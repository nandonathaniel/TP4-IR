Berkshire Hathaway has never split its Class A shares because of management 's desire to attract long - term investors as opposed to short - term speculators . However , Berkshire Hathaway created a Class B stock , with a per - share value originally kept ( by specific management rules ) close to ⁄ of that of the original shares ( now Class A ) and ⁄ of the per - share voting rights , and after the January 2010 split , at ⁄ the price and ⁄ the voting rights of the Class - A shares . Holders of class A stock are allowed to convert their stock to Class B , though not vice versa . Buffett was reluctant to create the class B shares , but did so to thwart the creation of unit trusts that would have marketed themselves as Berkshire look - alikes . As Buffett said in his 1995 shareholder letter : `` The unit trusts that have recently surfaced fly in the face of these goals . They would be sold by brokers working for big commissions , would impose other burdensome costs on their shareholders , and would be marketed en masse to unsophisticated buyers , apt to be seduced by our past record and beguiled by the publicity Berkshire and I have received in recent years . The sure outcome : a multitude of investors destined to be disappointed . ''
