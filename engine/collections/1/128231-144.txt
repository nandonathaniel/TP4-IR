Louisiana , the District of Columbia , Kansas , Wisconsin , and Washington held primaries in February after Super Tuesday . Despite McCain picking up big victories , Huckabee won Louisiana and Kansas . McCain narrowly carried the Washington caucuses over Huckabee and Paul , who amassed a large showing . The Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico closed February for the Republicans . After Super Tuesday , John McCain had become the clear front runner , but by the end of February , he still had not acquired enough delegates to secure the nomination . In March , John McCain clinched the Republican nomination after sweeping all four primaries , Texas , Ohio , Vermont , and Rhode Island , putting him over the top of the 1,191 delegates required to win the GOP nomination . Mike Huckabee then conceded the race to McCain , leaving Ron Paul , who had just 16 delegates , as his only remaining opponent . Romney would eventually become the Republican presidential nominee 4 years later , which he then lost to Barack Obama .
