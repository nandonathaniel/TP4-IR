Negotiations between East Fremantle and South Fremantle to enter into the VFL as a merged club began in 1987 . However , due to an exclusive rights clause granted to the West Coast Eagles this would be impossible until the end of the 1992 season . Further applications were made by the clubs to join but their model was out of favour with the West Australian Football Commission .
