By the end of the first season , the character of Smith is permanently established as a bungling , self - serving , greedy and manipulative coward . These character traits are magnified in subsequent seasons . His haughty bearing , and ever - present alliterative repartee , were staples of the character . While he and Major West repeatedly clashed over his goldbricking , or because of some villainy he had perpetrated , the Robot was usually the preferred victim of his barbed and acerbic wit .
