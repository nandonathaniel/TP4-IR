Frasier seems to have become a lonely bachelor who spends his evenings eating vegetable soup and looking after a friend 's cat , Mr. Bottomsley . Dining out with the family is also now an embarrassment for him , being between two couples : Niles and Daphne , and Martin and Ronee . Roz offers to set him up with a friend of hers , a divorc√©e who works in insurance , saying she would be the perfect `` placeholder '' . Frasier is not keen , but desperate not to turn into a solitary old man , agrees to a date with Ann ( played by Julia Sweeney ) . Halfway through what he finds an insufferably dull meal , Kenny appears with his attractive cousin Liz Wright ( Krista Allen ) who works in the arts , and offers Frasier a way out . All he has to do is get rid of his date .
