Lafayette learned that the Continental Congress lacked funds for his voyage ; hence , he acquired the sailing ship Victoire with his own money , for 112,000 pounds . He journeyed to Bordeaux , where Victoire was being prepared for her trip , and sent word asking for information on his family 's reaction . The response , including letters from his wife and other relatives , threw Lafayette into emotional turmoil . Soon after departure , he ordered the ship turned around and returned to Bordeaux , to the frustration of the officers traveling with him . The army commander there ordered Lafayette to report to his father - in - law 's regiment in Marseilles . De Broglie , who hoped to become a military and political leader in America , met with Lafayette in Bordeaux and convinced him that the government actually wanted him to go . This was not true , though there was considerable public support for Lafayette in Paris , where the American cause was popular . Lafayette wanted to believe it , and pretended to comply with the order to report to Marseilles , going only a few miles east before turning around and returning to his ship . Victoire set sail for the United States on 20 April 1777 .
