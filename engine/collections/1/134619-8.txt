Two later pro leagues that rivaled the NBA adopted a modified version of the shot clock . The American Basketball League used a 30 - second shot clock for its two years in existence ( 1961 -- 1963 ) . The American Basketball Association also adopted a 30 - second clock when it launched in 1967 -- 68 , switching to the NBA 's 24 - second length for its final season ( 1975 -- 76 ) .
