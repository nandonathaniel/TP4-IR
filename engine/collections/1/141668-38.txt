The memory of Ponatic 's War in 1763 had made most of the Indians living in the Ohio river valley , the Great Lakes and the Mississippi river valley distrustful of all whites , and most of the Indians in the region had no desire to fight for either Congress or the Crown . Only the Haudenosaunee ( Iroquois ) living in their homeland of Kaniekeh ( modern upstate New York ) were regarded as willing to fight for the Crown , and even then some of the Six Nations like the Oneida and the Tuscarora were already negotiating with the Americans . The Catholic Haudenosaunee living outside of Montreal - the so - called Seven Nations of Canada - were traditionally allies of the French and their loyalty to the British Crown was felt to be very shallow . Both Arnold and Allen argued to Congress that the British forces holding Canada were weak , that the Canadiens would welcome the Americans as liberators and an invasion would require only 2 , 000 men . Taking Canada would eliminate any possibility of the British using it as a base to invade New England and New York .
