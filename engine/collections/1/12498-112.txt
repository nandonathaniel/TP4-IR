Under the law , incandescent bulbs that produce 310 -- 2600 lumens of light are effectively phased out between 2012 and 2014 unless they can meet the increasing energy efficiency standards mandated by the bill . Bulbs outside this range ( roughly , light bulbs currently less than 40 watts or more than 150 watts ) are exempt from the ban . Also exempt are several classes of speciality lights , including appliance lamps , `` rough service '' bulbs , 3 - way , colored lamps , and plant lights .
