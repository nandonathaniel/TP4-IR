Helen Hayes starred in two Miss Marple films for television : A Caribbean Mystery ( 1983 ) and Murder with Mirrors ( 1985 ) , near the end of her decades long acting career . She had earlier appeared in a TV movie adaptation of the non-Marple Christie story Murder Is Easy , playing an elderly lady somewhat similar to Miss Marple .
