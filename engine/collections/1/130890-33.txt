In American English it is sometimes referred to as the mellow johnny , a mispronunciation of its French name originally by Lance Armstrong , who wore it many times while riding in the 1999 - 2005 races . Armstrong also uses the name `` Mellow Johnny '' for his Texas - based bike shop . The Lance Armstrong Foundation donated the yellow jersey from Armstrong 's fourth Tour de France win ( 2002 ) to the National Museum of American History .
