Projectional radiographs are useful in the detection of pathology of the skeletal system as well as for detecting some disease processes in soft tissue . Some notable examples are the very common chest X-ray , which can be used to identify lung diseases such as pneumonia , lung cancer , or pulmonary edema , and the abdominal x-ray , which can detect bowel ( or intestinal ) obstruction , free air ( from visceral perforations ) and free fluid ( in ascites ) . X-rays may also be used to detect pathology such as gallstones ( which are rarely radiopaque ) or kidney stones which are often ( but not always ) visible . Traditional plain X-rays are less useful in the imaging of soft tissues such as the brain or muscle . One area where projectional radiographs are used extensively is in evaluating how an orthopedic implant , such as a knee , hip or shoulder replacement , is situated in the body with respect to the surrounding bone . This can be assessed in two dimensions from plain radiographs , or it can be assessed in three dimensions if a technique called ' 2D to 3D registration ' is used . This technique purportedly negates projection errors associated with evaluating implant position from plain radiographs .
