Spells are divided into rough categories , such as `` charms '' , `` curses '' , `` hexes '' , or `` jinxes '' . Although offensive and potentially dangerous curses exist in number , three are considered usable only for great evil , which earns them the special classification of `` Unforgivable Curses '' .
