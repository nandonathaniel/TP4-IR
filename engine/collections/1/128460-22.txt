Members of the yew family and the closely related Cephalotaxaceae have the most highly modified cones of any conifer . There is only one scale in the female cone , with a single poisonous ovule . The scale develops into a soft , brightly coloured sweet , juicy , berry - like aril which partly encloses the deadly seed . The seed alone is poisonous . The whole ' berry ' with the seed is eaten by birds , which digest the sugar - rich scale and pass the hard seed undamaged in their droppings , so dispersing the seed far from the parent plant .
