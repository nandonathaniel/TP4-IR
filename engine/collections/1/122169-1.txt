A service - level agreement is an agreement between two or more parties , where one is the customer and the others are service providers . This can be a legally binding formal or an informal `` contract '' ( for example , internal department relationships ) . The agreement may involve separate organizations , or different teams within one organization . Contracts between the service provider and other third parties are often ( incorrectly ) called SLAs -- because the level of service has been set by the ( principal ) customer , there can be no `` agreement '' between third parties ; these agreements are simply `` contracts . '' Operational - level agreements or OLAs , however , may be used by internal groups to support SLAs . If some aspect of a service has not been agreed with the customer , it is not an `` SLA '' .
