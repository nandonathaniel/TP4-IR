Everglades National Park has a tropical savanna climate ( Köppen climate classification : Aw ) and tropical monsoon climate ( Köppen climate classification : Am ) , depending on location . Most of the central region has a savanna climate while regions closer to shore , especially the eastern quarter of the park has a monsoonal climate . Both climates are characterized by two seasons : wet and dry . The park 's dry season lasts from December to April , when temperatures vary from 53 ° F ( 12 ° C ) to 77 ° F ( 25 ° C ) and humidity is low . Since water levels are low at that time , animals congregate at central water locations , providing popular opportunities for viewing the wildlife . During the wet season , from May to November , temperatures are consistently above 90 ° F ( 33 ° C ) and humidity over 90 percent . Storms can drop 10 to 12 inches ( 300 mm ) of rain at a time , providing half the year 's average of 60 inches ( 152 cm ) of rainfall in just two months .
