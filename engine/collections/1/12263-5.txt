After winning the American Association league championship in 1889 , the Grays ( by then nicknamed the Bridegrooms ) moved to the National League and won the 1890 NL Championship , the only Major League team to win consecutive championships in both professional `` base ball '' leagues . They lost the 1889 World Series to the New York Giants and tied the 1890 World Series with the Louisville Colonels . Their success during this period was partly attributed to their having absorbed skilled players from the defunct New York Metropolitans and Brooklyn Ward 's Wonders . In 1899 , most of the original Baltimore Orioles stars moved to the Grays ( Bridegrooms ) along with Orioles manager Ned Hanlon who became the club 's new manager under Charles Ebbets , who had by now accumulated an 80 % share of the club . The new combined team was dubbed the `` Superbas '' by the press and would become the champions of the National League in 1899 and again in 1900 .
