Sound waves travel differently through fish than through water because a fish 's air - filled swim bladder has a different density than seawater . This density difference allows the detection of schools of fish by using reflected sound . Acoustic technology is especially well suited for underwater applications since sound travels farther and faster underwater than in air . Today , commercial fishing vessels rely almost completely on acoustic sonar and sounders to detect fish . Fishermen also use active sonar and echo sounder technology to determine water depth , bottom contour , and bottom composition .
