Fiduciary markers are used in a wide range of medical imaging applications . Images of the same subject produced with two different imaging systems may be correlated ( called image registration ) by placing a fiduciary marker in the area imaged by both systems . In this case , a marker which is visible in the images produced by both imaging modalities must be used . By this method , functional information from SPECT or positron emission tomography can be related to anatomical information provided by magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) . Similarly , fiducial points established during MRI can be correlated with brain images generated by magnetoencephalography to localize the source of brain activity .
