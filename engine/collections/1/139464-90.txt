The United States made use of the Central Intelligence Agency ( CIA ) to do away with a string of unfriendly Third World governments and to support allied ones . In 1953 , President Eisenhower 's CIA implemented Operation Ajax , a covert operation aimed at the overthrow of the Iranian prime minister , Mohammad Mosaddegh . The popularly elected and non-aligned Mosaddegh had been a Middle Eastern nemesis of Britain since nationalizing the British - owned Anglo - Iranian Oil Company in 1951 . Winston Churchill told the United States that Mosaddegh was `` increasingly turning towards communism . '' The pro-Western shah , Mohammad Reza Pahlavi , assumed control as an autocratic monarch . The shah 's policies included the banning of the communist Tudeh Party of Iran and general suppression of political dissent by SAVAK , the shah 's domestic security and intelligence agency .
