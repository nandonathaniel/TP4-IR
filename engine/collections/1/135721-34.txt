After the war , Bayern became a member of the Oberliga Süd , the southern conference of the German first division , which was split five ways at that time . Bayern struggled , hiring and firing 13 coaches between 1945 and 1963 . Landauer returned from exile in 1947 and was once again appointed club president , the tenure lasted until 1951 . He remains as the club 's president with the longest accumulated tenure . Landauer has been deemed as inventor of Bayern as a professional club and his memory is being upheld by the Bayern ultras Schickeria . In 1955 , the club was relegated but returned to the Oberliga in the following season and won the DFB - Pokal for the first time , beating Fortuna Düsseldorf 1 -- 0 in the final . The club struggled financially though , verging on bankruptcy at the end of the 1950s . Manufacturer Roland Endler provided the necessary funds and was rewarded with four years at the helm of the club . In 1963 , the Oberligas in Germany were consolidated into one national league , the Bundesliga . Five teams from the Oberliga South were admitted . Bayern finished third in that year 's southern division , but another Munich team , 1860 Munich , had won the championship . As the DFB preferred not to include two teams from one city , Bayern was not chosen for the Bundesliga . They gained promotion two years later , fielding a team with young talents like Franz Beckenbauer , Gerd Müller and Sepp Maier -- who would later be collectively referred to as the axis .
