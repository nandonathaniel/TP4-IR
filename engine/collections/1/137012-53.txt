The eruption was documented by contemporary historians and is generally accepted as having started on 24 August 79 , relying on one version of the text of Pliny 's letter . However the archeological excavations of Pompeii suggest that the city was buried about three months later . This is supported by another version of the letter , which gives the date of the eruption as November 23 .
