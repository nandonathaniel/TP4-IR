The local people eat on a floor mat . The dishes are placed on the center of it . They sit in the circle and traditionally eat with their bare hands . The drinking water is contained in `` Kan '' or '' Jok '' , ( little Thai cup . ) Nowadays , fork and spoon are used instead of bare hands . Sitting on a chair and eating at a table now predominates . There are only few local people who still preserve the original dinning style .
