In chemistry , heterogeneous catalysis refers to the form of catalysis where the phase of the catalyst differs from that of the reactants . Phase here refers not only to solid , liquid , vs gas , but also immiscible liquids , e.g. oil and water . The great majority of practical heterogeneous catalysts are solids and the great majority of reactants are gases or liquids . Heterogeneous catalysis is of paramount importance in many areas of the chemical and energy industries . Heterogeneous catalysis has attracted Nobel prizes for Fritz Haber in 1918 , Carl Bosch in 1931 , Irving Langmuir in 1932 , and Gerhard Ertl in 2007 .
