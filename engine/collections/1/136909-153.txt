In 1816 Governorate of Estonia proposed a law for emancipation of serfs which was based on the model of the Prussian reforms . Czarist authorities ordered Courland Landtag to come up with a similar proposal , which was accepted on August 25 , 1817 and proclaimed in Jelgava on August 30 , 1818 in presence of Czar Alexander I. Emancipation came into force in 1819 and continued until 1832 as only selected number of peasants was emancipated each year . Emancipation gave peasants personal freedom , but no land , which they had to lease from land - owners . Peasants were not completely free , as they still could not move to another governorate or city without land - lord 's permit .
