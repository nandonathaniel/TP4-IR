Tooth destruction from processes other than dental caries is considered a normal physiologic process but may become severe enough to become a pathologic condition . Attrition is the loss of tooth structure by mechanical forces from opposing teeth . Attrition initially affects the enamel and , if unchecked , may proceed to the underlying dentin . Abrasion is the loss of tooth structure by mechanical forces from a foreign element . If this force begins at the cementoenamel junction , then progression of tooth loss can be rapid since enamel is very thin in this region of the tooth . A common source of this type of tooth wear is excessive force when using a toothbrush . Erosion is the loss of tooth structure due to chemical dissolution by acids not of bacterial origin . Signs of tooth destruction from erosion is a common characteristic in the mouths of people with bulimia since vomiting results in exposure of the teeth to gastric acids . Another important source of erosive acids are from frequent sucking of lemon juice . Abfraction is the loss of tooth structure from flexural forces . As teeth flex under pressure , the arrangement of teeth touching each other , known as occlusion , causes tension on one side of the tooth and compression on the other side of the tooth . This is believed to cause V - shaped depressions on the side under tension and C - shaped depressions on the side under compression . When tooth destruction occurs at the roots of teeth , the process is referred to as internal resorption , when caused by cells within the pulp , or external resorption , when caused by cells in the periodontal ligament .
