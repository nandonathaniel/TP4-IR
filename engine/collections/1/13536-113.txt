Hyundai entered motorsport by competing in the F2 class of the World Rally Championship in 1998 and 1999 . In September 1999 , Hyundai unveiled the Accent WRC , a World Rally Car based on the Hyundai Accent . The Hyundai World Rally Team debuted the car at the 2000 Swedish Rally and achieved their first top - ten result at that year 's Rally Argentina , when Alister McRae and Kenneth Eriksson finished seventh and eighth , respectively . Eriksson later drove the car to fifth place in New Zealand and fourth in Australia . In 2001 , Hyundai debuted a new evolution of the Accent WRC , which was intended to improve reliability , but the performance of the car was still not good enough to challenge the four big teams ( Ford , Mitsubishi , Peugeot and Subaru ) . However , at the season - ending Rally GB , the team achieved their best result with McRae finishing fourth and Eriksson sixth .
