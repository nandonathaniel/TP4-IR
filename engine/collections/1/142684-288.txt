On 17 January 2012 , New Jersey Governor Chris Christie signed into law a bill that legalized direct shipping from wineries to consumers , and permits New Jersey wineries to open as many as 15 offsite retail sales outlets in the state . The law allows wineries that make less than 250,000 gallons of wine annually , which includes all of New Jersey 's wineries , to ship up to 12 cases of wine to per year to any person over 21 in New Jersey or any other state that allows wine shipments . Because this prohibits 90 % of wine made in the United States , but does not affect New Jersey 's small wineries , proponents of the law fear that this section of the law will be struck down as unconstitutional . The U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit had struck down a similar limit in Massachusetts in 2008 in light of the United States Supreme Court decision addressing direct shipping laws a few years earlier .
