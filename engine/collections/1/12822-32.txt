By the afternoon of July 20 the remaining outstanding issues were resolved as the parties agreed that the partition line should be at the 17th parallel and that the elections for reunification should be in July 1956 , two years after the ceasefire . The `` Agreement on the Cessation of Hostilities in Vietnam '' was signed only by French and Viet Minh military commands , completely bypassing the State of Vietnam . Based on a proposal by Zhou Enlai , an International Control Commission ( ICC ) chaired by India , with Canada and Poland as members , was placed in charge of supervising the ceasefire . Because issues were to be decided unanimously , Poland 's presence in the ICC provided the communists effective veto power over supervision of the treaty . The unsigned `` Final Declaration of the Geneva Conference '' called for reunification elections , which the majority of delegates expected to be supervised by the ICC . The Viet Minh never accepted ICC authority over such elections , stating that the ICC 's `` competence was to be limited to the supervision and control of the implementation of the Agreement on the Cessation of Hostilities by both parties . '' Of the nine delegates present , only the United States and the State of Vietnam refused to accept the declaration . Bedell Smith delivered a `` unilateral declaration '' of the US position , reiterating : `` We shall seek to achieve unity through free elections supervised by the United Nations to insure that they are conducted fairly .
