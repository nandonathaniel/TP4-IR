The legendary Bill Russell was hired as the head coach in the following year , and in 1975 he coached the SuperSonics to the playoffs for the first time . The team , which starred Haywood , guards Fred Brown and Slick Watts , and rookie center Tommy Burleson , defeated the Detroit Pistons in a three - game mini-series before falling to the eventual champion Golden State Warriors in six games . The next season , the SuperSonics traded Haywood to New York forcing the remaining players to pick up the offensive slack . Guard Fred Brown , now in his fifth season , was selected to the 1976 NBA All - Star Game and finished fifth in the league in scoring average and free throw percentage . Burleson 's game continued to strengthen , while Watts led the NBA in both assists and steals and was named to the All - NBA Defensive First Team . The SuperSonics again made the playoffs , but lost to the Phoenix Suns in six games in spite of strong performances from both Brown ( 28.5 ppg ) and Burleson ( 20.8 ppg ) during the series .
