You seem ... to consider the judges as the ultimate arbiters of all constitutional questions ; a very dangerous doctrine indeed , and one which would place us under the despotism of an oligarchy . Our judges are as honest as other men , and not more so . They have , with others , the same passions for party , for power , and the privilege of their corps ... Their power ( is ) the more dangerous as they are in office for life , and not responsible , as the other functionaries are , to the elective control . The Constitution has erected no such single tribunal , knowing that to whatever hands confided , with the corruptions of time and party , its members would become despots . It has more wisely made all the departments co-equal and co-sovereign within themselves .
