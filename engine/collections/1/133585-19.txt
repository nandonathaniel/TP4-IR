Missense mutations : Code for a different amino acid . A missense mutation changes a codon so that a different protein is created , a non-synonymous change . Conservative mutations : Result in an amino acid change . However , the properties of the amino acid remain the same ( e.g. , hydrophobic , hydrophilic , etc . ) . At times , a change to one amino acid in the protein is not detrimental to the organism as a whole . Most proteins can withstand one or two point mutations before their function changes . Non-conservative mutations : Result in an amino acid change that has different properties than the wild type . The protein may lose its function , which can result in a disease in the organism . For example , sickle - cell disease is caused by a single point mutation ( a missense mutation ) in the beta - hemoglobin gene that converts a GAG codon into GUG , which encodes the amino acid valine rather than glutamic acid . The protein may also exhibit a `` gain of function '' or become activated , such is the case with the mutation changing a valine to glutamic acid in the braf gene ; this leads to an activation of the RAF protein which causes unlimited proliferative signalling in cancer cells . These are both examples of a non-conservative ( missense ) mutation . Silent mutations : Code for the same amino acid ( a `` synonymous substitution '' ) . A silent mutation has no effect on the functioning of the protein . A single nucleotide can change , but the new codon specifies the same amino acid , resulting in an unmutated protein . This type of change is called synonymous change , since the old and new codon code for the same amino acid . This is possible because 64 codons specify only 20 amino acids . Different codons can lead to differential protein expression levels , however .
