In the discussions that followed , several facts emerged . For one , it transpired that it was not by coincidence that the involvement of Degussa had been publicized in Switzerland , because another company that had bid to produce the anti-graffiti substance was located there . Further , the foundation managing the construction , as well as Lea Rosh , had known about Degussa 's involvement for at least a year but had not done anything to stop it . Rosh then claimed she had not known about the connections between Degussa and Degesch . It also transpired that another Degussa subsidiary , Woermann Bauchemie GmbH , had already poured the foundation for the stelae . A problem with excluding Degussa from the project was that many of the stelae had already been covered with Degussa 's product . These would have to be destroyed if another company were to be used instead . The resulting cost would be about â‚¬ 2.34 million . In the course of the discussions about what to do , which lasted until November 13 , most of the Jewish organizations including the Central Council of Jews in Germany spoke out against working with Degussa , while the architect Peter Eisenman , for one , supported it .
