In April 1699 , French colonists established the first European settlement at Fort Maurepas ( also known as Old Biloxi ) , built in the vicinity of present - day Ocean Springs on the Gulf Coast . It was settled by Pierre Le Moyne d'Iberville . In 1716 , the French founded Natchez on the Mississippi River ( as Fort Rosalie ) ; it became the dominant town and trading post of the area . The French called the greater territory `` New France '' ; the Spanish continued to claim part of the Gulf coast area ( east of Mobile Bay ) of present - day southern Alabama , in addition to the entire area of present - day Florida .
