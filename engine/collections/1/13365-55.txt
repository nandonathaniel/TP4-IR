In Theravadin soteriology , the principle of anattā means there is neither a permanent self nor complete annihilation of the person at death ; there is only the arising and ceasing of causally related phenomena . Paticcasamuppāda also describes the Twelve Nidānas of dukkha `` suffering '' that lead to rebirth , from avijjā `` ignorance '' to jarāmaraṇa `` aging and death '' , and the parallel reverse - order interdependent cessation of these factors .
