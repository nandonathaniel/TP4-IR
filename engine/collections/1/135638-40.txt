In Washington D.C. , US Vice President Allan Trumbull ( Morgan Freeman ) works with the British authorities to investigate the incident while trying to track down the President . Trumbull receives a call from Barkawi , still alive after all and operating out of Yemen . The man takes responsibility for the attacks , coordinated by his son Kamran ( Waleed Zuaiter ) . Barkawi purposely had Wilson poisoned to lure the Western leaders to London to attack them . Barkawi knows Asher is still alive , and promises that if Kamran captures him , he will broadcast the execution of the President on the Internet . Trumbull orders his intelligence staff to local Barkawi 's known operatives to find any connection to the attack , while British authorities have all first responders stand down , so than any left in the open can be identified as terrorists .
