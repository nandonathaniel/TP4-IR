One mystery of the pyramid 's construction is its planning . John Romer suggests that they used the same method that had been used for earlier and later constructions , laying out parts of the plan on the ground at a 1 - to - 1 scale . He writes that `` such a working diagram would also serve to generate the architecture of the pyramid with precision unmatched by any other means '' . He also argues for a 14 - year time - span for its construction . A modern construction management study , in association with Mark Lehner and other Egyptologists , estimated that the total project required an average workforce of about 14,500 people and a peak workforce of roughly 40,000 . Without the use of pulleys , wheels , or iron tools , they used critical path analysis methods , which suggest that the Great Pyramid was completed from start to finish in approximately 10 years .
