Nitromethane also has a high latent heat of vaporization , meaning that it will absorb substantial engine heat as it vaporizes , providing an invaluable cooling mechanism . The laminar flame speed and combustion temperature are higher than gasoline at 0.5 m / s and 2400 Â° C respectively . Power output can be increased by using very rich air fuel mixtures . This is also something that helps prevent pre-ignition , something that is usually a problem when using nitromethane .
