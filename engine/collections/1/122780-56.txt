Bissinger spends the chapter discussing the football players at Dallas Carter High School , which is an all black upper middle class high school . The football obsession at Dallas Carter dwarfs the one at Permian . Players skipped classes , left school to get lunch , and had their grades fixed by teachers so that they could play . This led to a court case when a teacher , Will Bates , refused to lie about the algebra grade of a key player , Gary Edwards . The case was won and Dallas Carter got to continue their season . During the week of the game the coaches from Permian and Dallas Carter meet to decide where the game will be played . They eventually agree on Texas Memorial Stadium at the University of Texas at Austin . They also agree on a racially mixed officiating crew to minimize any possible bias from that source .
