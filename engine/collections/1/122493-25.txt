Evan finds Heidi waiting for him at home , who saw the letter online , immediately knowing that it was one of Evan 's therapy assignments . She apologizes to Evan for not seeing how badly he had been hurting . Evan says that it was n't her fault , he lied to her about so much . He then vaguely admits that his fall had been a suicide attempt . Heidi sits him down and recalls the day that his father moved out : how she felt so small and alone , and did n't know how she was going to make it by herself . In the end , however , she realized that she was n't alone -- she had Evan and knew that the two of them could make it through anything as long as they were together . Tearfully , Heidi promises that she 'll always be there for him when he needs her ( `` So Big / So Small '' ) .
