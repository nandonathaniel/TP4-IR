Bacteria can develop antibiotic resistance . Recent findings show no necessity of large populations of bacteria for the appearance of antibiotic resistance . Small populations of E. coli in an antibiotic gradient can become resistant . Any heterogeneous environment with respect to nutrient and antibiotic gradients may facilitate antibiotic resistance in small bacterial populations . Researchers hypothesize that the mechanism of resistance development is based on four SNP mutations in the genome of E. coli produced by the gradient of antibiotic .
