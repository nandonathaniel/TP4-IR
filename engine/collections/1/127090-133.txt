Like the Dutch before them , the British initially had little interest in the Cape Colony , other than as a strategically located port . The Cape Articles of Capitulation of 1806 allowed the colony to retain `` all their rights and privileges which they have enjoyed hitherto '' , and this launched South Africa on a divergent course from the rest of the British Empire , allowing the continuance of Roman - Dutch law . British sovereignty of the area was recognised at the Congress of Vienna in 1815 , the Dutch accepting a payment of 6 million pounds for the colony . As one of their first tasks they outlawed the use of the Dutch language in 1806 with the view of converting the European settlers to the British language and culture . This had the effect of forcing more of the Dutch colonists to move ( or trek ) away from British administrative reach . Much later , in 1820 the British authorities persuaded about 5,000 middle - class British immigrants ( most of them `` in trade '' ) to leave Great Britain . Many of the 1820 Settlers eventually settled in Grahamstown and Port Elizabeth .
