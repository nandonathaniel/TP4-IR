Ragusan economist Benedetto Cotrugli 's 1458 treatise Della mercatura e del mercante perfetto contained the earliest known manuscript of a double - entry bookkeeping system , however Cotrugli 's manuscript was not officially published until 1573 . In fact even at the time of writing his work in 1494 Pacoili was aware of Cotrugli 's efforts and credited Cortrugli with the origination of the double entry book keeping system .
