In low doses , methamphetamine can cause an elevated mood and increase alertness , concentration , and energy in fatigued individuals . At higher doses , it can induce psychosis , rhabdomyolysis , and cerebral hemorrhage . Methamphetamine is known to have a high potential for abuse and addiction . Recreational use of methamphetamine may result in psychosis or lead to post-withdrawal syndrome , a withdrawal syndrome that can persist for months beyond the typical withdrawal period . Unlike amphetamine and cocaine , methamphetamine is neurotoxic to humans , damaging both dopamine and serotonin neurons in the central nervous system ( CNS ) . Entirely opposite to the long - term use of amphetamine , there is evidence that methamphetamine causes brain damage from long - term use in humans ; this damage includes adverse changes in brain structure and function , such as reductions in gray matter volume in several brain regions and adverse changes in markers of metabolic integrity .
