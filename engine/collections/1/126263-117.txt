After the end of the late Middle Ages period , the Renaissance spread unevenly over continental Europe from the southern European region . The intellectual transformation of the Renaissance is viewed as a bridge between the Middle Ages and the Modern era . Europeans would later begin an era of world discovery . Combined with the influx of classical ideas was the invention of printing which facilitated dissemination of the printed word and democratized learning . These two things would lead to the Protestant Reformation . Europeans also discovered new trading routes , as was the case with Columbus ' travel to the Americas in 1492 , and Vasco da Gama 's circumnavigation of Africa and India in 1498 . Their discoveries strengthened the economy and power of European nations .
