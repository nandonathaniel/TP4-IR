The division of the eukaryotes into two primary clades , bikonts ( Archaeplastida + SAR + Excavata ) and unikonts ( Amoebozoa + Opisthokonta ) , derived from an ancestral biflagellar organism and an ancestral uniflagellar organism , respectively , had been suggested earlier . A 2012 study produced a somewhat similar division , although noting that the terms `` unikonts '' and `` bikonts '' were not used in the original sense .
