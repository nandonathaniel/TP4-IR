The most popular dances throughout the decade were the foxtrot , waltz , and American tango . From the early 1920s , however , a variety of eccentric novelty dances were developed . The first of these were the Breakaway and Charleston . Both were based on African American musical styles and beats , including the widely popular blues . The Charleston 's popularity exploded after its feature in two 1922 Broadway shows . A brief Black Bottom craze , originating from the Apollo Theater , swept dance halls from 1926 to 1927 , replacing the Charleston in popularity . By 1927 , the Lindy Hop , a dance based on Breakaway and Charleston and integrating elements of tap , became the dominant social dance . Developed in the Savoy Ballroom , it was set to stride piano ragtime jazz . The Lindy Hop later evolved into other Swing dances . These dances , nonetheless , never became mainstream , and the overwhelming majority of people in Western Europe and the U.S. continued to dance the foxtrot , waltz , and tango throughout the decade .
