This extended period of growth ended in Q2 of 2008 when the United Kingdom suddenly entered a recession -- its first for nearly two decades -- brought about by the global financial crisis . The UK was particularly vulnerable to the crisis because its financial sector was the most highly leveraged of any major economy . Beginning with the collapse of Northern Rock , which was taken into public ownership in February 2008 , other banks had to be partly nationalised . The Royal Bank of Scotland Group , at its peak the fifth - largest bank in the world by market capitalisation , was effectively nationalised in October 2008 . By mid-2009 , HM Treasury had a 70.33 % controlling shareholding in RBS , and a 43 % shareholding , through UK Financial Investments Limited , in Lloyds Banking Group . The Great Recession , as it came to be known , saw unemployment rise from just over 1.6 million in January 2008 to nearly 2.5 million by October 2009 .
