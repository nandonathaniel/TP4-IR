The Cubs had high expectations in 2002 , but the squad played poorly . On July 5 , 2002 , the Cubs promoted assistant general manager and player personnel director Jim Hendry to the General Manager position . The club responded by hiring Dusty Baker and by making some major moves in 2003 . Most notably , they traded with the Pittsburgh Pirates for outfielder Kenny Lofton and third baseman Aramis Ram√≠rez , and rode dominant pitching , led by Kerry Wood and Mark Prior , as the Cubs led the division down the stretch .
