When the film opens , Undertow is a large purple and black colored tiger shark , but during the opening fight , he is zapped by the magic of King Triton 's trident and transformed into a small , piranha - like fish so he ca n't eat or harm Melody . Undertow spends the next twelve years as a piranha . After Melody rebels against her mother , Undertow convinces Melody to visit Morgana , who manipulates her into fetching the trident . When Melody retrieves the trident , Morgana uses its magic to restore Undertow to his original form . During the final fight , Undertow battles Melody 's friends Tip and Dash , and crashes into a wall of ice and all his teeth fall out . He is not seen again afterwards but was most likely killed upon impact with the ice wall .
