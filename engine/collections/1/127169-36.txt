After leaving the boneyard , guests were told that they would be entering a `` live '' movie set while the cast was on break . The tram would then move into an area known as Catastrophe Canyon , a rocky area with a fuel truck and water tanks inside of it . While the tram was stopped , filming starts suddenly . An earthquake shakes the tram and causes the fuel truck to explode , sending a fire ball into the air . Then a flood of water comes rushing down from the canyon and from above the tram . When the earthquake subsides and the water stops , the set would then begin to reset for the next tram and the host on the tram tells guests how it was done as the tram travels behind the set to show the back of the production .
