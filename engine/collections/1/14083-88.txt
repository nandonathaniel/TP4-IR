The Ontario government 's normal process for highway construction was not possible given the financial constraints of the recession of the early 1990s . The Peterson government sought out private sector partnerships and acquired innovative electronic tolling technology . Two firms bid on the project , with the Canadian Highways International Corporation being selected as the operator of the highway . Financing for the highway was to be paid by user tolls lasting 35 years , after which it would return to the provincial system as a toll - free 400 - series highway . The succeeding government of Bob Rae announced on March 31 , 1995 , that the corridor reserved for Highway 403 between Burlington and Oakville would instead be built as a western extension of Highway 407 .
