After nightfall on October 6 , troops moved out in stormy weather to dig the first parallel : the heavily overcast sky negated the waning full moon and shielded the massive digging operation from the eyes of British sentries . Washington ceremoniously struck several blows with his pick axe to begin the trench . The trench was to be 2,000 yards ( 1,800 m ) long , running from the head of Yorktown to the York River . Half of the trench was to be commanded by the French , the other half by the Americans . On the northernmost end of the French line , a support trench was dug so that they could bombard the British ships in the river . The French were ordered to distract the British with a false attack , but the British were told of the plan by a French deserter and the British artillery fire turned on the French from the Fusiliers redoubt .
