Hillenburg also felt that it was important for the series to develop its own music library , consisting of scores that could be reused and re-edited throughout the years . He wanted these scores to be composed by unknowns , and a group of twelve was assembled . They formed `` The Sponge Divers Orchestra '' , which includes Carr and Belfer . This group went on to provide the majority of the music for later seasons , although Carr still draws from the Associated Production Music Library , as well as another library that he founded himself -- Animation Music Inc .
