The Rastafari movement developed out of the legacy of the Atlantic slave trade , in which over ten million Africans were enslaved and transported from Africa to the Americas between the sixteenth and nineteenth centuries . Here , they were sold to European planters and forced to work on the plantations . Around a third of these transported Africans were relocated in the Caribbean , with under 700,000 being settled in Jamaica . Here , the enslaved Africans were divided into a stratified system , with field workers on the lowest rung and house servants above them . In 1834 , slavery in Jamaica was abolished after the British government passed the Slavery Abolition Act 1833 . Racial prejudice nevertheless remained prevalent across Jamaican society , with those of African descent being second - class citizens . For most of the nineteenth century , the overwhelming majority of Jamaica 's legislative council was white . Formerly enslaved Africans and Afro - Jamaicans became free peasants . In the three decades after emancipation , the Free Village system proliferated across Jamaica as non-conformist missionaries , particularly Baptist , purchased land from the large owners and sold it as smaller plots to former slaves .
