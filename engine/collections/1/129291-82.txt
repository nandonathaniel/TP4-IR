Before the broadcast of the first episode , David Brown from Radio Times said , `` Atmospheric , intriguing and with a primetime sheen that seems a world away from soapland , it 'll have you hooked from episode one . '' A writer for What 's on TV said , `` It 's gripping and surprising , has a thoroughbred cast of Irish actors and is more filmic than soap . Worth delving into even if you 've never heard of Kat and Alfie . '' Tom Eames from Digital Spy called the series a `` bold move from the BBC '' that `` looks like a show that is a must - watch whether you 're an EastEnders fan or not . '' Steven Murphy , editor for Inside Soap , urged the magazine 's readers to watch Redwater , despite previous soap spin - offs , such as Ricky & Bianca or Coronation Street : Open All Hours , being unmemorable , because `` It 's mysterious , moody and dramatic -- and looks stunning by making the best of its gorgeous Irish location . '' Fiona Sturges from The Guardian said , `` There is -- improbable as it sounds -- a degree of suspense here , not to say proper acting . The problem is that whenever Kat and Alfie appear -- he the well - meaning idiot , she the wounded fishwife -- the spell is broken . The BBC is trying to sell this as Broadchurch meets The Wicker Man , but the reality is more NCSI : Ballykissangel . I love Kat and Alfie , but the quicker they get back to Albert Square , the better . '' Sean O'Grady from The Independent said , `` it 's an un-soapy , unclaustrophobic sort of production , and a storyline about a long - lost son adds the necessary emotional stress . ''
