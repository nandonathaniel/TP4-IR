In the early 1970s , women sociologists began to question sociological paradigms and the invisibility of women in sociological studies , analysis , and courses . In 1969 , feminist sociologists challenged the discipline 's androcentrism at the American Sociological Association 's annual conference . This led to the founding of the organization Sociologists for Women in Society , and , eventually , a new sociology journal , Gender & Society . Today , the sociology of gender is considered to be one of the most prominent sub-fields in the discipline .
