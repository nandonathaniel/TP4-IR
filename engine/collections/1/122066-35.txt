Testosterone can be administered parenterally , but it has more irregular prolonged absorption time and greater activity in muscle in enanthate , undecanoate , or cypionate ester form . These derivatives are hydrolyzed to release free testosterone at the site of injection ; absorption rate ( and thus injection schedule ) varies among different esters , but medical injections are normally done anywhere between semi-weekly to once every 12 weeks . A more frequent schedule may be desirable in order to maintain a more constant level of hormone in the system . Injectable steroids are typically administered into the muscle , not into the vein , to avoid sudden changes in the amount of the drug in the bloodstream . In addition , because estered testosterone is dissolved in oil , intravenous injection has the potential to cause a dangerous embolism ( clot ) in the bloodstream .
