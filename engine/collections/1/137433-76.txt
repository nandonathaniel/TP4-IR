Warner Bros. announced in September of 2009 that a feature film focusing on the DC Comics character Lobo was in development . That same year , Deadline reported that Guy Ritchie would direct the film , and that production would begin in early - 2010 . His `` irreverent , gruff tone '' from his previous work would be utilized for the adaptation , though the studio was aiming for a PG - 13 rating from the MPAA . In their coverage of the film 's development , Variety described the film 's premise as : `` Lobo is a seven - foot tall , blue - skinned , indestructible and heavily muscled anti-hero who drives a pimped out motorcycle , and lands on Earth in search of four fugitives who are bent on wreaking havoc . Lobo teams with a small town teenage girl to stop the creatures . '' However , by 2010 Ritchie left the project to pursue a sequel to his box - office hit , Sherlock Holmes and the film was put on hold . By April of 2012 , Brad Peyton had signed on as writer and director , with Dwayne Johnson entering negotiations to play the titular character in July . By the next year , Johnson had signed on to portray Black Adam in the shared universe , withdrawing from the running to play Lobo . In March 2016 , it was reported that Jason Fuchs was working on a re-write of the script . June of the same year , the Fuchs confirmed that the character would be portrayed as he was in the original comic book story arcs .
