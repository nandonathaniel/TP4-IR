President Franklin D. Roosevelt attempted to expand the Court in 1937 . His proposal envisioned appointment of one additional justice for each incumbent justice who reached the age of 70 years 6 months and refused retirement , up to a maximum bench of 15 justices . The proposal was ostensibly to ease the burden of the docket on elderly judges , but the actual purpose was widely understood as an effort to `` pack '' the Court with justices who would support Roosevelt 's New Deal . The plan , usually called the `` court - packing plan '' , failed in Congress . Nevertheless , the Court 's balance began to shift within months when Justice van Devanter retired and was replaced by Senator Hugo Black . By the end of 1941 , Roosevelt had appointed seven justices and elevated Harlan Fiske Stone to Chief Justice .
