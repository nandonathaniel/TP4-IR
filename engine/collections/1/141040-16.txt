After the success of Walt Disney Productions ' first feature - length animated film Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs ( 1937 ) , filmmaker Walt Disney himself made several attempts to adapt the fairy tale `` Beauty and the Beast '' by Jeanne - Marie Leprince de Beaumont into one of the studio 's earliest animated feature films during the 1930s and 1950s . However , the project was continuously abandoned due to the fairy tale 's `` static '' plot and main characters . The filmmaker was also concerned about the `` unnecessary intensity '' Belle gets taken and is required to depict Belle imprisoned . Inspired by the unprecedented success of The Little Mermaid ( 1989 ) , Walt Disney Studios chairman Jeffrey Katzenberg green - lit another attempt at adapting `` Beauty and the Beast '' under the direction of Richard Purdum . However , Katzenberg did not approve of Purdum 's dark , somber version of the fairy tale , and ultimately ordered that it be restarted from scratch in favor of creating a Broadway - style musical film starring a strong heroine , similar to The Little Mermaid . Opting instead for a `` feminist twist '' on the story , Katzenberg hired television writer Linda Woolverton , who had never written an animated film before , to write the film 's screenplay .
