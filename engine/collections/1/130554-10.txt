Another example of a multi-trophic interaction is a trophic cascade , in which predators help to increase plant growth and prevent overgrazing by suppressing herbivores . Links in a food - web illustrate direct trophic relations among species , but there are also indirect effects that can alter the abundance , distribution , or biomass in the trophic levels . For example , predators eating herbivores indirectly influence the control and regulation of primary production in plants . Although the predators do not eat the plants directly , they regulate the population of herbivores that are directly linked to plant trophism . The net effect of direct and indirect relations is called trophic cascades . Trophic cascades are separated into species - level cascades , where only a subset of the food - web dynamic is impacted by a change in population numbers , and community - level cascades , where a change in population numbers has a dramatic effect on the entire food - web , such as the distribution of plant biomass .
