Habitat size and numbers of species are systematically related . Physically larger species and those living at lower latitudes or in forests or oceans are more sensitive to reduction in habitat area . Conversion to `` trivial '' standardized ecosystems ( e.g. , monoculture following deforestation ) effectively destroys habitat for the more diverse species that preceded the conversion . In some countries lack of property rights or lax law / regulatory enforcement necessarily leads to biodiversity loss ( degradation costs having to be supported by the community ) .
