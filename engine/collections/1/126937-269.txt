The game show has attracted attention from mathematicians , statisticians , and economists as a natural decision - making experiment . In 2008 a team of economists analyzed the decisions of people appearing in Dutch , German and U.S. episodes and found , among other things , that contestants are less risk - averse or even risk - seeking when they saw their expected winnings drop . They went so far as to say that the show , `` almost appears to be an economics experiment rather than a TV show . '' They found that contestants behave similarly in different versions of the show , despite large differences in the amounts at stake ; amounts appear to be evaluated in relative terms , for example in proportion to the initial average , and not in terms of their absolute monetary value . The research received a great deal of media attention , appearing on the front page of The Wall Street Journal and being featured on National Public Radio . This work was built upon by de Roos and Sarafidis , who analysed the Australian version of the show and determined that the risk - taking behaviour of a number of contestants would be inconsistent within each game ( i.e. their aversion to risk would change ) , depending on the state of play and relative risk aversion of their confidant on the show .
