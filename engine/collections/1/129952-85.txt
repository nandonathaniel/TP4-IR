After the defeat of the Imperial forces of Napoleon III in the Franco - Prussian War ( 1870 -- 1871 ) , c. 58,000 irregular troops known as francs tireurs ( `` free shooters '' ) were established by the French Government of National Defence , which killed c . 1,000 German troops and diverted c. 120,000 troops from field operations to the guarding of lines of communication . The status of neutral countries was established by the Fifth Convention of the Hague Peace Conference ( 1907 ) and signed by Germany . The Belgian government did not forbid resistance , because belligerents were not allowed to move troops or supplies through neutral territory ; Article 5 required neutrals to prevent such acts and Article 10 provided that resistance by a neutral could not be considered to be hostile . At Herv√© during the night of 4 August , firing broke out and a few days later , a German reporter wrote that only nineteen of 500 houses were still standing . The speed by which allegations of franc tireur warfare reached Germany , led to suspicions of orchestration , since newspapers reported atrocities against German soldiers on 5 August and on 8 August , troops marching towards the German - Belgian frontier bought newspapers containing lurid details of Belgian civilians marauding , ambushing German troops , desecrating corpses and poisoning wells .
