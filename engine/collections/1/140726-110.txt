The field of history generally leaves prehistory to the archaeologists , who have entirely different sets of tools and theories . The usual method for periodisation of the distant prehistoric past , in archaeology is to rely on changes in material culture and technology , such as the Stone Age , Bronze Age and Iron Age and their sub-divisions also based on different styles of material remains . Here prehistory is divided into a series of `` chapters '' so that periods in history could unfold not only in a relative chronology but also narrative chronology . This narrative content could be in the form of functional - economic interpretation . There are periodisation , however , that do not have this narrative aspect , relying largely on relative chronology and , thus , devoid of any specific meaning .
