The position angle of the secondary with respect to the primary is measured , together with the angular distance between the two stars . The time of observation is also recorded . After a sufficient number of observations are recorded over a period of time , they are plotted in polar coordinates with the primary star at the origin , and the most probable ellipse is drawn through these points such that the Keplerian law of areas is satisfied . This ellipse is known as the apparent ellipse , and is the projection of the actual elliptical orbit of the secondary with respect to the primary on the plane of the sky . From this projected ellipse the complete elements of the orbit may be computed , where the semi-major axis can only be expressed in angular units unless the stellar parallax , and hence the distance , of the system is known .
