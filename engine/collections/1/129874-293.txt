On 11 May 2017 , the president of Brazil , Michel Temer , sanctioned the law that creates the National Civil Identification ( NCI ) . The new Brazilian identity document intends to gather all the information of the citizen in a single document . Only the passport and the driver 's license of the Brazilian citizen will not be included in the NCI , since these documents can be seized for crimes that the citizen can commit . The single identity document should only be valid from 2021 .
