In the Pacific Theatre , during World War II , the Japanese used a labyrinth of underground fixed positions to slow down the Allied advances on many Pacific Islands . The Japanese built fixed fortifications on Iwo Jima , Okinawa , and Guadalcanal using a system of underground tunnels to interconnect their fortified positions . The Japanese had on Battle of Iwo Jima several levels of honeycombed fortifications . The Japanese caused the American advance to slow down and caused massive casualties with these underground fixed positions . The Americans had to use flamethrowers to clear them out , as well as systematic hand - to - hand fighting .
