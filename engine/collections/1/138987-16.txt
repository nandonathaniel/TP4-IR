The Middle English romance Arthour and Merlin casts Morgan le Fay herself in the role of the Lady of the Lake and residing near a town named Ninniane . The Italian manuscript Tavola ritonda ( The Round Table ) makes the Lady a daughter of Uther Pendragon and a sister to both Morgan and Arthur ; here she is a character villainous to the extent that her own brother Arthur swears to burn her . In the 15th - century Perceforest , the figures of the Lady of the Lake and of the enchantress Sebile have been merged to create the character of Sebile of the Lake , there the mother of Arthur himself .
