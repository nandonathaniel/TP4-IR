SURF has later been shown to have similar performance to SIFT , while at the same time being much faster . Other studies conclude that when speed is not critical , SIFT outperforms SURF . Specifically , disregarding discretization effects the pure image descriptor in SIFT is significantly better than the pure image descriptor in SURF , whereas the scale - space extrema of the determinant of the Hessian underlying the pure interest point detector in SURF constitute significantly better interest points compared to the scale - space extrema of the Laplacian to which the interest point detector in SIFT constitutes a numerical approximation .
