There is controversy over the use of the term limbic system , with scientists such as LeDoux arguing that the term be considered obsolete and abandoned . Originally , the limbic system was believed to be the emotional center of the brain , with cognition being the business of the neocortex . However , cognition depends on acquisition and retention of memories , in which the hippocampus , a primary limbic structure , is involved : hippocampus damage causes severe cognitive ( memory ) deficits . More important , the `` boundaries '' of the limbic system have been repeatedly redefined because of advances in neuroscience . Therefore , while it is true that limbic structures are more closely related to emotion , the brain can be thought of as an integrated whole .
