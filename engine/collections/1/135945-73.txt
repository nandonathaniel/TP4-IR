Static storage duration objects are created before main ( ) is entered ( see exceptions below ) and destroyed in reverse order of creation after main ( ) exits . The exact order of creation is not specified by the standard ( though there are some rules defined below ) to allow implementations some freedom in how to organize their implementation . More formally , objects of this type have a lifespan that `` shall last for the duration of the program '' .
