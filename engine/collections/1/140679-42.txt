The Court of Appeal of England and Wales ( Civil Division ) has affirmed a common law duty to give reasons for a judgment , subject to some exceptions ( such as an oral judgment or a summary judgment ) . The Court also noted that providing reasons for judgment `` is a function of due process , and therefore of justice . '' Interested parties must be able to determine why the court has made the decision in question . Furthermore , providing reasons for judgment serves a practical purpose insofar as it necessarily requires the court to engage in thoughtful consideration of the cases presented . However , the Court also noted that the exercise of providing reasons for judgment is contextual and the standard of what is acceptable for a judgment will vary depending on the circumstances . The court appears to propose that the ultimate requirement is the court explaining , in some way , why it has made the decision in question .
