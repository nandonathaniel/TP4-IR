Vouchers , tax rebates , and small dollar matching are called `` citizen funding '' as opposed to more traditional `` public funding '' , which tasks a public agency with deciding how much money each candidate receives from the government . While the Supreme Court of the United States has already struck down many forms of public funding of political campaigns , there are forms of public and especially citizen financing that seem consistent with the constitution as so far interpreted by the courts and could therefore be secured by standard legislative processes not requiring amending the constitution .
