When the Israelites migrated to Canaan between 1200 and 1001 BCE , they also adopted a variation of the Canaanite alphabet . Baruch ben Neriah , Jeremiah 's scribe , used this alphabet to create the later scripts of the Old Testament . The Early Hebrew alphabet was prominent in the Mediterranean region until Chaldean Babylonian rulers exiled the Jews to Babylon in the sixth century BCE . It was then that the new language ( `` Square Hebrew '' ) emerged and the older language rapidly died out .
