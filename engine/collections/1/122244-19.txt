The dorsal roots are afferent fascicles , receiving sensory information from the skin , muscles , and visceral organs to be relayed to the brain . The roots terminate in dorsal root ganglia , which are composed of the cell bodies of the corresponding neurons . Ventral roots consist of efferent fibers that arise from motor neurons whose cell bodies are found in the ventral ( or anterior ) gray horns of the spinal cord .
