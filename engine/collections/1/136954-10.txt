Wegener was the first to use the phrase `` continental drift '' ( 1912 , 1915 ) ( in German `` die Verschiebung der Kontinente '' -- translated into English in 1922 ) and formally publish the hypothesis that the continents had somehow `` drifted '' apart . Although he presented much evidence for continental drift , he was unable to provide a convincing explanation for the physical processes which might have caused this drift . His suggestion that the continents had been pulled apart by the centrifugal pseudoforce ( Polflucht ) of the Earth 's rotation or by a small component of astronomical precession was rejected , as calculations showed that the force was not sufficient . The Polflucht hypothesis was also studied by Paul Sophus Epstein in 1920 and found to be implausible .
