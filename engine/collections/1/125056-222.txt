Retrograde extrapolation is the mathematical process by which someone 's blood alcohol concentration at the time of driving is estimated by projecting backwards from a later chemical test . This involves estimating the absorption and elimination of alcohol in the interim between driving and testing . The rate of elimination in the average person is commonly estimated at . 015 to . 020 grams per deciliter per hour ( g / dl / h ) , although again this can vary from person to person and in a given person from one moment to another . Metabolism can be affected by numerous factors , including such things as body temperature , the type of alcoholic beverage consumed , and the amount and type of food consumed .
