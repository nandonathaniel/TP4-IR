At the start of each week , the HouseGuests compete in the Head of Household ( HoH ) competition . The winner of the HoH competition will select two HouseGuests to be nominated for eviction . As with the previous season , the first five weeks of the season feature two concurrent Heads of Household . Each HoH would nominate two other HouseGuests for eviction , totaling four nominees . The two pairs of nominees would then compete in the `` Battle of the Block '' competition . The winning pair would be removed from the block , with the HoH who nominated them dethroned . The dethroned HoH would later be eligible to be nominated as a replacement if the Veto was used , while the Battle of the Block winners are safe for the rest of the week . The rest of the cycle would continue as per usual , with the remaining HoH retaining immunity for the week , and the two nominees being eligible for safety through the Power of Veto . The reigning ( or sole ) HoH also earns the right to name the `` Have Nots '' for the week , forcing the chosen HouseGuests to eat solely `` Big Brother slop '' and a weekly food selection chosen by producers , take cold showers , and sleep in a bedroom designed to look like a dental clinic .
