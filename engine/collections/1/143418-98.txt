In the ' Scouring of the Shire ' , there is further mention of the half - orcs under Sharkey 's control , and they are described as men having squinty ( or slanty ) eyes and sallow complexion ( a description used to describe the Southerner , Saruman 's spy in The Fellowship of the Ring , as well as some of the orcs in The Two Towers ) . Which seems to suggest that they look mostly human but share some of the features of the orcs .
