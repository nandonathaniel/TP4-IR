Whereas many U.S. states use a three - tiered system of decentralization -- state / county / township -- most of Alaska uses only two tiers -- state / borough . Owing to the low population density , most of the land is located in the Unorganized Borough . As the name implies , it has no intermediate borough government but is administered directly by the state government . In 2000 , 57.71 % of Alaska 's area has this status , with 13.05 % of the population .
