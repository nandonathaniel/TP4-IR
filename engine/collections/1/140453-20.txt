Goldenvoice reserved tentative dates for October 2000 to reprise the festival , but ultimately canceled for that year ; Tollett blamed it on the oversaturation of music festivals in Southern California . The electronic dance music festival Nocturnal Wonderland filled the void at the Empire Polo Club , taking place in September 2000 . Goldenvoice opted to bring Coachella back in April 2001 in an attempt to beat the heat . Ticket prices were raised to $65 . Organizers encountered difficulty booking acts for the festival and due to `` available talent '' , were forced to shorten the festival to a single day . Issues with securing a headliner threatened to doom the event until Perry Farrell agreed to bring his reunited group Jane 's Addiction to the proceedings . Amidst financial concerns , Tollett agreed to sell Goldenvoice to Anschutz Entertainment Group ( AEG ) in March 2001 for $7 million . AEG , which had opened Staples Center in Los Angeles two years prior , purchased the promoter to help them find shows to book . The corporation wanted Tollett to continue staging Coachella , understanding that it initially would lose money ; Tollett initially retained full control of Coachella as a result of the acquisition . Like its predecessor , the 2001 festival went smoothly ; over 35,000 tickets were sold , and despite taking a loss again , Tollett estimates it was a `` low , low six - figure sum '' .
