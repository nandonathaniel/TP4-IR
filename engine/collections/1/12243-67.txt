Historians attribute the success of the Canadian Corps in capturing the ridge to a mixture of technical and tactical innovation , meticulous planning , powerful artillery support and extensive training , as well as the failure of the German Sixth Army to properly apply the new German defensive doctrine . The battle was the first occasion when all four divisions of the Canadian Expeditionary Force participated in a battle together and it was made a symbol of Canadian national achievement and sacrifice . A 100 - hectare ( 250 - acre ) portion of the former battleground serves as a memorial park and site of the Canadian National Vimy Memorial .
