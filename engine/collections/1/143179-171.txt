Radio stations in the United States often broadcast popular music . Each music station has a format , or a category of songs to be played ; these are generally similar to but not the same as ordinary generic classification . Many radio stations in the United States are locally owned and operated , and may offer an eclectic assortment of recordings ; many other stations are owned by large companies like Clear Channel , and are generally formatted on smaller , more repetitive playlists . Commercial sales of recordings are tracked by Billboard magazine , which compiles a number of music charts for various fields of recorded music sales . The Billboard Hot 100 is the top pop music chart for singles , a recording consisting of a handful of songs ; longer pop recordings are albums , and are tracked by the Billboard 200 . Though recorded music is commonplace in American homes , many of the music industry 's revenue comes from a small number of devotees ; for example , 62 % of album sales come from less than 25 % of the music - buying audience . Total CD sales in the United States topped 705 million units sold in 2005 , and singles sales just under three million .
