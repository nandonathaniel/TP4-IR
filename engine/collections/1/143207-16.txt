After Westinghouse installed his first large scale system Edison wrote in a November 1886 private letter to Edward Johnson , `` Just as certain as death Westinghouse will kill a customer within six months after he puts in a system of any size , He has got a new thing and it will require a great deal of experimenting to get it working practically . '' Edison seemed to hold a view that the very high voltage used in AC systems was too dangerous and that it would take many years to develop a safe and workable system . Safety and avoiding the bad press of killing a customer had been one of the goals in designing his DC system and he worried that a death caused by a mis - installed AC system could hold back the use of electricity in general , Edison 's understanding of how AC systems worked seemed to be extensive . He noted what he saw as inefficiencies and that , combined with the capital costs in trying to finance very large generating plants , led him to believe there would be very little cost savings in an AC venture . Edison was also of the opinion that DC was a superior system ( a fact that he was sure the public would come to recognize ) and inferior AC technology was being used by other companies as a way to get around his DC patents .
