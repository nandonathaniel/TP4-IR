Jacob 's staff : The Song Dynasty ( 960 -- 1279 ) polymath Shen Kuo ( 1031 -- 1095 ) , an antiquarian who pursued studies of archaeological finds , unearthed an ancient crossbow - like mechanism from a garden in Jiangsu which had on its stock a graduated sighting scale in minute measurements . He wrote that while viewing the whole of a mountain , the distance on the instrument was long , but while viewing a small part of the mountainside the distance was short due to the device 's cross piece that had to be pushed further away from the observer 's eye , with the graduation starting on the further end . He wrote that if one placed an arrow on the device and looked past its end , the degree of the mountain could be measured and thus its height could be calculated . Shen wrote that this was similar to mathematicians who used right - angled triangles to measure height . British scientist , sinologist , and historian Joseph Needham writes that what Shen had discovered was Jacob 's staff , a surveying tool which was not known in Europe until the medieval French Jewish mathematician Levi ben Gerson ( 1288 -- 1344 ) described it in 1321 .
