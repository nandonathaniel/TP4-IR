For example , in Alberta , English and French are both official languages of debate in the Legislative Assembly , but laws are drafted solely in English and there is no legal requirement that they be translated into French . French can be used in some lower courts and education is offered in both languages , but the bureaucracy functions almost solely in English . Therefore , although Alberta is not officially an English - only province , English has a higher de facto status than French . Ontario and Manitoba are similar but allow for more services in French at the local level .
