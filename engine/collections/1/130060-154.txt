According to European Space Agency ( ESA ) scientists , the lunar regolith ( a loose collection of irregular dust grains making up the Moon 's surface ) absorbs hydrogen nuclei from solar winds . Interaction between the hydrogen nuclei and oxygen present in the dust grains is expected to produce hydroxyl ( HO âˆ’ ) and water ( H 2O ) .
