Twitterbots are capable of influencing public opinion about culture , products and political agendas by automatically generating mass amounts of tweets through imitating human communication . The New York Times states , `` They have sleep - wake cycles so their fakery is more convincing , making them less prone to repetitive patterns that flag them as mere programs . '' The tweets generated vary anywhere from a simple automated response to content creation and information sharing , all of which depends on the intention of the person purchasing or creating the bot . The social implications these Twitterbots potentially have on human perception are sizeable according to a study published by the ScienceDirect Journal . Looking at the Computers as Social Actors ( CASA ) paradigm , the journal notes , `` people exhibit remarkable social reactions to computers and other media , treating them as if they were real people or real places . '' The study concluded that Twitterbots were viewed as credible and competent in communication and interaction making them suitable for transmitting information in the social media sphere . While the technological advances have enabled the ability of successful Human - Computer Interaction , the implications are questioned due to the appearance of both benign and malicious bots in the Twitter realm . Benign Twitterbots may generate creative content and relevant product updates whereas malicious bots can make unpopular people seem popular , push irrelevant products on users and spread misinformation , spam and / or slander .
