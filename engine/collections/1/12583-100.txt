When war commenced , Hitler and the OKW ( Oberkommando der Wehrmacht or `` High Command of the Armed Forces '' ) issued a series of Directives ordering planning and stating strategic objectives . `` Directive No. 1 for the Conduct of the War '' dated 31 August 1939 instructed the invasion of Poland on 1 September as planned . Potentially , Luftwaffe `` operations against England '' were to `` dislocate English imports , the armaments industry , and the transport of troops to France . Any favourable opportunity of an effective attack on concentrated units of the English Navy , particularly on battleships or aircraft carriers , will be exploited . The decision regarding attacks on London is reserved to me . Attacks on the English homeland are to be prepared , bearing in mind that inconclusive results with insufficient forces are to be avoided in all circumstances . '' Both France and the UK declared war on Germany ; on 9 October Hitler 's `` Directive No. 6 '' planned the offensive to defeat these allies and `` win as much territory as possible in Holland , Belgium , and northern France to serve as a base for the successful prosecution of the air and sea war against England '' . On 29 November OKW `` Directive No. 9 -- Instructions For Warfare Against The Economy Of The Enemy '' stated that once this coastline had been secured , the Lufwaffe together with the Kriegsmarine ( German Navy ) was to blockade UK ports with sea mines , attack shipping and warships , and make air attacks on shore installations and industrial production . This directive remained in force in the first phase of the Battle of Britain . It was reinforced on 24 May during the Battle of France by `` Directive No. 13 '' which authorised the Luftwaffe `` to attack the English homeland in the fullest manner , as soon as sufficient forces are available . This attack will be opened by an annihilating reprisal for English attacks on the Ruhr Basin . ''
