The judges ' categories were announced in July 2017 , with additional details of the judges ' houses announced in October 2017 . Anthony Russell withdrew after the pre-recorded sections of the show and was replaced by Sam Black who was knocked out of the competition at the Bootcamp stage . Black was in Walsh 's Boys category . In a statement , Walsh stated , `` Anthony has been fantastic across the series , a great singer and performer who we are really sad to see go . I had to think for a long time who could take the place . Sam had a great reaction from the British public when his Audition aired . So I re-watched it and realised we missed a trick not putting him through at Boot Camp . He has that retro 60s style viewers will love . He 's really likeable and talented and I ca n't wait to hear more . '' At the end of judges ' houses , it was announced that the public could vote for a wildcard from each category bringing the total amount of contestants for the live shows to 16 .
