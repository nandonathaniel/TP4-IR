`` Love Me like You Do '' is a mid-tempo electropop power ballad , with instrumentation consisting of massive synths and crushing drums . Lyrically , similar to the film 's theme , the song talks about the uncontrollable feeling of falling in love and being seduced by someone whose touch leaves her begging for more , even when it hurts . It received acclaim from music critics , who praised Goulding 's soft vocals and the song for being sultry and grandiose . The song earned Goulding her first Grammy Award nomination for Best Pop Solo Performance , while the songwriters were nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Song Written for Visual Media , the Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song , and the Broadcast Film Critics Association Award for Best Song .
