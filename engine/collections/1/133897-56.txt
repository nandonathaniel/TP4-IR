Tammy Larsen ( voiced by Jenny Slate ) -- Tina 's mean girl nemesis , who continuously bullies her . She usually wears heavy makeup and has blonde hair , which she wears in a side ponytail . She acts like the `` popular '' and `` hot '' girl , despite the fact that nobody likes her . She was a brunette in her first appearance on the show ( in the episode `` Bad Tina '' ) , but in subsequent episodes she is blonde ( this fact is acknowledged twice in the show : once in the episode `` Broadcast Wagstaff School News , '' in which she taunts Tina by saying `` I 'm a blonde now so I 'm better than you , '' and the second in the episode `` Lice Things Are Lice , '' in which she says , `` You 're not a blonde , '' and Tina replies , `` Neither are you . '' ) Andy and Ollie once described her as a `` bathroom clown '' due to her makeup . Tammy comes from a Jewish family and is at least twelve years old , as she has celebrated her bat mitzvah -- or rather she tried to , as Tina wound up taking her place at the party , much to the relief of everyone , including Tammy 's own relatives . She is also Wagstaff 's head cheerleader and has a problem with passing gas , caused by laughing too hard , by someone lifting her up wrong , or because of nerves .
