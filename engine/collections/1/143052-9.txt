Chapter two takes place almost 60 years later in the psychedelic daze of Swinging London during 1969 , a place where tadukic acid diethylamide 26 is the drug of choice ( similar to LSD ) , and where different underworlds are starting to overlap dangerously to an accompaniment of sit - ins and sitars . Starting to buckle from the pressures of the twentieth century and the weight of their own endless lives , Mina and her companions must nevertheless prevent the making of a Moonchild that might well turn out to be the Antichrist . In chapter three , the narrative draws to its cataclysmic close in London 2009 . The magical child whose ominous coming has been foretold for the past hundred years has now been born and has grown up to claim his dreadful heritage . His promised eon of unending terror can commence , the world can now be ended starting with North London .
