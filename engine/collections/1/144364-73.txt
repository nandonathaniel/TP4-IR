Cinecolor , a bi-pack color process , the photographer would load a standard camera with two films , one orthochromatic , dyed red , and a panchromatic strip behind it . Color light would expose the cyan record on the ortho stock , which also acted as a filter , exposing only red light to the panchromatic film stock .
