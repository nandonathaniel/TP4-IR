It is common among players to never touch or hoist the Prince of Wales Trophy ( Eastern Conference champion ) or Clarence S. Campbell Bowl ( Western Conference champion ) after they have won the conference finals ; the players feel that the Stanley Cup is the true championship trophy and thus it should be the only trophy that they should be hoisting . There have been five recent exceptions to this -- Scott Stevens of the Devils in 2000 and 2003 and Sidney Crosby of the Penguins in 2009 , 2016 , and 2017 . In four of these occurrences , their teams went on to win the Stanley Cup . In recent years , the captain of the winning team poses ( usually looking solemn ) with the conference trophy , and sometimes , the entire team poses as well .
