In 2006 , the New Zealand Commerce Commission issued proceedings against Visa and MasterCard , alleging that interchange fees constitute price fixing and result in a substantial lessening of competition . Shortly before the court case was due to start in Autumn 2009 , the suit was settled out of court ; the `` no surcharge rule '' was prohibited , allowing retailers to pass on the cost of MasterCard and Visa transactions to the customer , and card issuers were allowed to set their own interchange fees , within a maximum limit set by Visa or MasterCard . All issuers of MasterCard cards in New Zealand announced they would be charging the maximum rate . The Commission released a report in 2013 reviewing the outcome of the settlement , showing that many merchants were paying higher fees for accepting credit cards than before the settlement .
