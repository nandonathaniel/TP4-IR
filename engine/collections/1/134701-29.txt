Linguistically , this stage of Irish represents a transition between Middle Irish and Modern Irish . For example , neuter nouns still trigger eclipsis of a following complement , as they did in Middle Irish , but less consistently . The distinction between preposition + accusative to show motion toward a goal ( e.g. san gcath `` into the battle '' ) and preposition + dative to show non -- goal - oriented location ( e.g. san chath `` in the battle '' ) is lost during this period , as is the distinction between nominative and accusative case in nouns .
