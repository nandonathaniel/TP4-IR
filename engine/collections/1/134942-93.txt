After a lull in February 1936 , the Italians in the south prepared an advance towards the city of Harar . On 22 March , the Regia Aeronautica bombed Harar and Jijiga , reducing them to ruins even though Harar had been declared an `` open city '' . On 14 April , Graziani launched his attack against Ras Nasibu Emmanual to defeat the last Ethiopian army in the field at the Battle of the Ogaden . The Ethiopians were drawn up behind a defensive line that was termed the `` Hindenburg Wall '' , designed by the chief of staff of Ras Nasibu , and Wehib Pasha , a seasoned ex-Ottoman commander . After ten days , the last Ethiopian army had disintegrated ; 2,000 Italian soldiers and 5,000 Ethiopian soldiers were killed or wounded .
