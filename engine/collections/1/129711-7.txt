The World Wealth Report was co-published by Merrill Lynch and Capgemini , previously known as Cap Gemini Ernst & Young who worked together since c. 1993 , investigating the `` needs of high - net - worth individuals ( HNWIs are individuals with more than $1 million in assets excluding primary residence ) '' in order to `` successfully serve this market segment . '' Their first annual World Wealth Report was published in 1996 . The World 's Wealth Report defines HNWIs as those who hold at least US $1 million in assets excluding primary residence and ultra-HNWIs as those who hold at least US $30 million in assets excluding primary residence . The report states that in 2008 there were 8.6 million HNWIs worldwide , a decline of 14.9 % from 2007 . The total HNWI wealth worldwide totaled US $32.8 trillion , a 19.5 % decrease from 2007 . The ultra-HNWIs experienced the greater loss , losing 24.6 % in population size and 23.9 % in accumulated wealth . The report revised its 2007 projections that HNWI financial wealth would reach US $59.1 trillion by 2012 and revised this downward to a 2013 HNWI wealth valued at $48.5 trillion advancing at an annual rate of 8.1 % .
