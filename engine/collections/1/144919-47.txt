Gilded Age politics , called the Third Party System , featured intense competition between two major parties , with minor parties coming and going , especially on issues of concern to prohibitionists , to labor unions and to farmers . The Democrats and Republicans ( nicknamed the `` Grand Old Party , '' GOP ) fought over control of offices , which were the rewards for party activists , as well as over major economic issues . Very high voter turnout often exceeded 80 % or even 90 % in some states as the parties drilled their loyal members much as an army drills its soldiers .
