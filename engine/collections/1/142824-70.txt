Some keywords , such as those related to hacking , are not allowed at all . From June 2007 , Google banned AdWords adverts for student essay - writing services , a move which received positive feedback from universities . Google has a variety of specific keywords and categories that it prohibits that vary by type and by country . For example , use of keywords for alcohol related products are prohibited in Thailand and Turkey ; keywords for gambling and casinos are prohibited in Poland ; keywords for abortion services are prohibited in Russia and Ukraine ; and keywords for adult related services or products are prohibited worldwide as of June 2014 . This has prompted debate among the adult industry with many questioning Google 's position as a monopoly .
