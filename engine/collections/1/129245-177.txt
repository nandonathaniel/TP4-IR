The Old Testament stresses the special relationship between God and his chosen people , Israel , but includes instructions for proselytes as well . This relationship is expressed in the biblical covenant ( contract ) between the two , received by Moses . The law codes in books such as Exodus and especially Deuteronomy are the terms of the contract : Israel swears faithfulness to God , and God swears to be Israel 's special protector and supporter .
