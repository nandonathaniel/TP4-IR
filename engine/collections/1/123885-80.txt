The team 's first NHL jerseys , worn from the inaugural season of 1970 -- 71 ( modified for the 1972 -- 73 season ) until the end of the 1977 -- 78 season , featured a hockey stick in the shape of a shallow `` V '' superimposed on a blue rink - shaped rectangle forming the letter `` C '' , designed by North Vancouver artist Joe Borovich . A modified version of this logo is still in use , as a shoulder patch on the team 's current jerseys and as the primary logo of their alternate jerseys .
