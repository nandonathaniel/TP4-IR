When used in the same manner as external rotating drives ( hard drives , optical drives , or floppy drives ) , i.e. in ignorance of their technology , USB drives ' failure is more likely to be sudden : while rotating drives can fail instantaneously , they more frequently give some indication ( noises , slowness ) that they are about to fail , often with enough advance warning that data can be removed before total failure . USB drives give little or no advance warning of failure . Furthermore , when internal wear - leveling is applied to prolong life of the flash drive , once failure of even part of the memory occurs it can be difficult or impossible to use the remainder of the drive , which differs from magnetic media , where bad sectors can be marked permanently not to be used .
