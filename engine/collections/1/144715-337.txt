Shokera ( しょう けら , Shōkera ) Voiced by : Mitsuki Saiga ( Japanese ) ; Brianne Siddall ( English ) A yōkai in the form of a man with long silver hair , who is deeply religious ( the religion likely being Christianity ) ; he goes to confession for every sin he commits , even killing under Hagoromo Gitsune 's orders . He can generate a blinding light , and enlarge the cross on his necklace into a spear . Shokera can turn into a form where his eyes and body became those of a bee , growing a pair of giant mosquito wings , with hands similar to those of a praying mantis . He was seen with Hagoromo Gitsune , 400 years ago when he fought Daruma . In the present , he attacks the Keikain with his insect yōkai minions to collect livers ; however , he is killed by Aotoba . According to the Keikain report , Shokera is an insect yōkai that comes forth once every 60 days on `` Koshin '' , the 57th day . He ascends to heaven and reports the sins of all humans to heaven while they are sleeping ; heaven then takes the lives of sinners . This is why people must n't sleep on the day of Koshin . To avoid this , one would spend the entire day praying to a statue of the raging god , Shomen Kongo .
