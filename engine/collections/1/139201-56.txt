After a one - All Star Weekend layoff ( the NBA did not have an All Star Weekend during the labor - shortened 1999 season ) , the NBA decided to bring the Slam Dunk Contest back for the 2000 All - Star Weekend in Oakland , California . It would prove to be one of the most electrifying dunk contests in the league 's history , featuring a great showdown between eventual winner Vince Carter of the Toronto Raptors , his cousin and then - teammate Tracy McGrady , and the Houston Rockets ' Steve Francis . Carter won after performing a number of very impressive dunks , including two reverse 360 windmills , a honey dip , and a between - the - legs dunk off a bounced alley - oop from McGrady . The next four contests did not feature superstars like Carter and Bryant , and despite innovative efforts by the likes of Desmond Mason and Jason Richardson , the lack of A-list superstars willing to participate hurt the appeal of the contest .
