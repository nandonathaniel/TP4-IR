The patronymics such as Munioitz , Santxez or Santxitz , and Diaitz ( Spanish spellings : Muñoz , Sánchez , and Díaz ) are the most common and ancient . The Basque monarchy , including the first king of Pamplona , Iñigo Iñigitz , or Eneko Aritza , were the first to use this type of surname . Patronymics are by far the most common surnames in the whole of the Basque Autonomic Community and Navarra .
