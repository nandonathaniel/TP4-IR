The umpire , John Garrett , decided to restart the race from the eastern end of Chiswick Eyot . Shortly after the restart the boats clashed and the oar of Oxford crewman Hanno Wienhausen was broken . Garrett judged the clash to be Oxford 's fault and allowed the race to continue . Cambridge quickly took the lead and went on to win the race . The Oxford crew entered a final appeal to the umpire which was quickly rejected ; and Cambridge were confirmed as winners by ​ 4 ⁄ lengths . It was the first time since 1849 that a crew had won the boat race without an official recorded winning time . After the end of the race Oxford 's bow man , Alex Woods , received emergency treatment after collapsing in the boat from exhaustion . Because of the circumstances , the post-race celebrations by the winning Cambridge crew were unusually muted and the planned award ceremony was cancelled .
