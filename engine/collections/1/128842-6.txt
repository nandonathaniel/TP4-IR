While the Proto - Semitic language did not have any articles , the most likely theory is that the article al - comes from the same proto - Semitic source as the Hebrew definite article ה ־ ha - . That theory is based primarily on the fact that the two share many similarities . Both particles are prefixed to nouns , and both geminate with certain following letters . Moreover , neither particle is prefixed to non-final nouns in a genitival construction . Finally , both are prefixed to relative clauses . According to David Testen , many northern and southwestern Semitic languages have particles that bear similarities to al - . With this fact , he posits that al - has a proto - Semitic antecedent .
