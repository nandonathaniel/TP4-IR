Finn is a 5 - foot tall teenage human . He has several missing teeth , yellow hair , of which the length differs due to occasional haircuts . His eyes and eyebrows appear black from a distance , but according to lead character designer Andy Ristaino , they are blue . He wears a white bear hat , short blue pants , and a light blue T - shirt . He also has a green backpack , black shoes , and socks rolled down to his ankles . Finn has peach color skin . Finn is a teenage boy who is average height and weight . His arms and legs are very thin , but he has a wide torso . He is missing several teeth because they often face monsters that hit him in the face , also he often bites rocks and other hard objects . These teeth are sometimes round or pointed and constantly changing place , depending on the occasion . In the episode `` The Enchiridion ! '' it can be seen for a moment that his left eye is green while his right eye is blue , as if he has heterochromia . However , Andy Ristaino confirmed that this was a `` special occasion '' and that in fact both eyes are light blue , which is not visible to the naked eye . He also points out in that episode that Finn had a small round nose but this is considered more of an error or humorous scene .
