The Barbary pirates were pirates and privateers that operated from the North African ( the `` Barbary coast '' ) ports of Tunis , Tripoli , Algiers , Sal√© and ports in Morocco , preying on shipping in the western Mediterranean Sea from the time of the Crusades as well as on ships on their way to Asia around Africa until the early 19th century . The coastal villages and towns of Italy , Spain and Mediterranean islands were frequently attacked by them and long stretches of the Italian and Spanish coasts were almost completely abandoned by their inhabitants ; since the 17th century , Barbary pirates occasionally entered the Atlantic and struck as far north as Iceland . According to Robert Davis , between 1 million and 1.25 million Europeans were captured by Barbary pirates and sold as slaves in the Arab world between the 16th and 19th centuries .
