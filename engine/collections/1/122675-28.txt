That night , Anna is summoned to the King 's private chambers where he says that after reading the Bible , he believes that the world was not created in six days , but after many centuries . The King disregards her explanation and orders her to take a letter to President Abraham Lincoln , in which he will send male elephants to America to help with the Civil War , forcing her to sit on the floor due to an ancient custom that nobody 's head should be higher than his . She is left to finish the letter herself when she tries to explain that the elephants will not last long if only male elephants are sent . Anna goes outside , only to come across Lun Tha and learn that he has been meeting Tuptim in secret . He asks her to arrange a rendezvous and she refuses out of fear , but eventually relents after remembering her past with her husband . The lovers meet under the cover of darkness and Lun Tha promises he will one day return to Siam and they will escape together .
