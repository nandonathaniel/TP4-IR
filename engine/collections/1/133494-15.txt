Because of the Platte 's brackish water , the preferred camping spots were along one of the many fresh water streams draining into the Platte or the occasional fresh water spring found along the way . These preferred camping spots became sources of cholera in the epidemic years ( 1849 -- 1855 ) as many thousands of people used the same camping spots with essentially no sewage facilities or adequate sewage treatment . There are many cases cited where a person would be alive and apparently healthy in the morning and dead by nightfall .
