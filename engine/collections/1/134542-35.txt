In recent times , feasts are usually organized by religious brotherhoods , with the greatest expenses being for the higher charges . Similarly , in the pre-Spanish kingdom of Man√≠ , some religious feasts seem to have been sponsored by wealthy and preeminent men , perhaps reflecting a general practice in Postclassic and earlier kingdoms . Through the feasts , capital could be redistributed in food and drink . The continual and obligatory drinking , negatively commented on by early as well as contemporary outsiders , establishes community , not only among the human participants , but also between these and the deities .
