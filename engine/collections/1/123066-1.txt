In biochemistry , amino acids having both the amine and the carboxylic acid groups attached to the first ( alpha - ) carbon atom have particular importance . They are known as 2 - , alpha - , or Î± - amino acids ( generic formula H NCHRCOOH in most cases , where R is an organic substituent known as a `` side chain '' ) ; often the term `` amino acid '' is used to refer specifically to these . They include the 22 proteinogenic ( `` protein - building '' ) amino acids , which combine into peptide chains ( `` polypeptides '' ) to form the building - blocks of a vast array of proteins . These are all L - stereoisomers ( `` left - handed '' isomers ) , although a few D - amino acids ( `` right - handed '' ) occur in bacterial envelopes , as a neuromodulator ( D - serine ) , and in some antibiotics .
