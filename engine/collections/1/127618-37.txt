In the first game at the HemisFair Arena the Spurs lost to the San Diego Conquistadors , despite attracting a noisy crowd of 6,000 fans . A smothering defense was the team 's image , as they held opponents less than 100 points an ABA record 49 times . The early Spurs were led by ABA veteran James Silas , and the team would get stronger as the season went on as they twice took advantage of the Virginia Squires , acquiring Swen Nater , who would go on to win Rookie of the Year , in November , and `` The Iceman '' George Gervin in January . The ABA tried to halt the Gervin deal , claiming it was detrimental to the league , but a judge would rule in the Spurs ' favor , and Gervin made his Spurs debut on February 7 . The Spurs would go on to finish with a 45 -- 39 record , good for 3rd place in the Western Division .
