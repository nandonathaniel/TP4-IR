In Japan , an NPO is any citizen 's group that serves the public interest and does not produce a profit for its members . NPOs are given corporate status to assist them in conducting business transactions . As at February 2011 , there were 41,600 NPOs in Japan . Two hundred NPOs were given tax - deductible status by the government , which meant that only contributions to those organizations were tax deductible for the contributors .
