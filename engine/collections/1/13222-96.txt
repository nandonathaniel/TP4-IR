The UK has been at the forefront of developments in film , radio and television . Broadcasting in the UK has historically been dominated by the taxpayer - funded but independently run British Broadcasting Corporation ( commonly known as the BBC ) , although other independent radio and television ( ITV , Channel 4 , Five ) and satellite broadcasters ( especially BSkyB which has over 10 million subscribers ) have become more important in recent years . BBC television , and the other three main television channels are public service broadcasters who , as part of their licence allowing them to operate , broadcast a variety of minority interest programming . The BBC and Channel 4 are state - owned , though they operate independently .
