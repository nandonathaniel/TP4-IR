Stretching : ( Mozzarella , Provolone ) The curd is stretched and kneaded in hot water , developing a stringy , fibrous body . Cheddaring : ( Cheddar , other English cheeses ) The cut curd is repeatedly piled up , pushing more moisture away . The curd is also mixed ( or milled ) for a long time , taking the sharp edges off the cut curd pieces and influencing the final product 's texture . Washing : ( Edam , Gouda , Colby ) The curd is washed in warm water , lowering its acidity and making for a milder - tasting cheese .
