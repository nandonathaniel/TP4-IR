Jailbait images can be differentiated from child pornography , as they do not feature minors before the onset of puberty , nor do they contain nudity . The images are , however , usually sexualized , often featuring tween or young teen girls in bikinis , skirts , underwear or lingerie . Whether or not these images are legal is debated . When questioned regarding their legality legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin stated he thought it was not illegal , though legal expert Sunny Hostin was more skeptical , describing jailbait images as `` borderline '' child pornography which may be illegal .
