Shepard and McClaren make it to Mount Melbourne , but are called back to base camp due to an approaching heavy storm . McClaren begs for more time , and Shepard gives him half a day , which is enough time to find a fragment of the meteorite . En route back to base , McClaren slips down an embankment , breaking his leg and falling into freezing water . Shepard uses the lead dog Maya to carry a rope to McClaren and pulls him out . The two battle hypothermia , frostbite and near whiteout conditions as the dogs lead them home . Once there , the entire human crew is immediately evacuated , while the dogs are left behind . Certain that their pilot will return within days for the dogs , Shepard tightens their collars to ensure they can not get loose and run away . But because of the harsh weather conditions , no rescue can be attempted until the next spring - and by then the dogs will be dead .
