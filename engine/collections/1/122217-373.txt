Unlike earlier in the Republic , legionaries were no longer fighting on a seasonal basis to protect their land . Instead , they received standard pay , and were employed by the state on a fixed - term basis .

A destabilising consequence of this development was that the proletariat `` acquired a stronger and more elevated position '' within the state .
