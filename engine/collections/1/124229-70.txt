The Texans are 3 -- 4 (. 429 ) all - time in playoff games . All four of the Texans ' playoff berths were as a result of winning the AFC South division championship . The Texans have a 3 - 1 record all - time in Wild Card Round games but have lost all three games they have played in the Divisional Round . In 2016 this trend continued as the Texans defeated the Oakland Raiders 27 - 14 in a Wild Card game at home , but then were eliminated by the eventual Super Bowl LI champion New England Patriots 34 - 16 in the Divisional Round the following weekend .
