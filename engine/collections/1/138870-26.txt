Mackinac Island does not permit motor vehicles ( except for emergency vehicles and , in winter , snowmobiles ) , and transport to and from the dock to the hotel is via horse - drawn carriage . The only other motor vehicles allowed in recent history were cars brought over for the filming of Somewhere in Time . During the winter months , when ice prevents ferry transport from the mainland , the hotel is closed . The island also has a small airport ( no fuel or services ) for private aircraft . The horse - drawn taxis will take guests from the airport to the hotel or any other destination .
