Cowher led the Steelers to the playoffs in each of his first six seasons , a feat that had been accomplished only by legendary coach Paul Brown of the Cleveland Browns . In those first six seasons , Cowher coached them as deep as the AFC Championship Game three times and following the 1995 season an appearance in Super Bowl XXX on the strength of the `` Blitzburgh '' defense . However , the Steelers lost to the Dallas Cowboys in Super Bowl XXX , two weeks after a thrilling AFC Championship victory over the Indianapolis Colts . Cowher produced the franchise 's record - tying fifth Super Bowl win in Super Bowl XL over the National Football Conference champion Seattle Seahawks ten years later . With that victory , the Steelers became the third team to win five Super Bowls , and the first sixth - seeded playoff team to reach and win the Super Bowl since the NFL expanded to a 12 - team post-season tournament in 1990 . He coached through the 2006 season which ended with an 8 -- 8 record , just short of the playoffs . Overall Cowher 's teams reached the playoffs 10 of 15 seasons with six AFC Championship Games , two Super Bowl berths and a championship .
