Kagura is the ancient Shinto ritual dance of shamanic origin . The word `` kagura '' is thought to be a contracted form of kami no kura or `` seat of the kami '' or the `` site where the kami is received . '' There is a mythological tale of how kagura dance came into existence . The sun goddess Amaterasu became very upset at her brother so she hid in a cave . All of the other gods and goddesses were concerned and wanted her to come outside . Ame - no - uzeme began to dance and create a noisy commotion in order to entice Amaterasu to come out . The kami ( gods ) tricked Amaterasu by telling her there was a better sun goddess in the heavens . Amaterasu came out and light returned to the universe .
