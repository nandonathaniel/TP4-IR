Hammerheads have disproportionately small mouths and seem to do a lot of bottom - hunting . They are also known to form schools during the day , sometimes in groups of over 100 . In the evening , like other sharks , they become solitary hunters . National Geographic explains that hammerheads can be found in warm tropical waters , but during the summer , hammerheads participate in a mass migration to search for cooler waters .
