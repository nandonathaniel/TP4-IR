On the other hand , the city of New York had grown to over five and a half million inhabitants , and urgently needed new subway lines . The dual system could not keep pace with this ever - increasing ridership . So , a compromise solution was finally found that would allow Hylan 's plans as well as the interests of private operators to be considered . However , the city 's and Hylan 's long - term goal was the unification and consolidation of the existing subway , with the city operating a unified subway system ( see below ) . The city , bolstered by political claims that the private companies were reaping profits at taxpayer expense , determined that it would build , equip and operate a new system itself , with private investment and without sharing the profits with private entities . This led to the building of the Independent City - Owned Subway ( ICOS ) , sometimes called the Independent Subway System ( ISS ) , the Independent City - Owned Rapid Transit Railroad , or simply The Eighth Avenue Subway after the location of its premier Manhattan mainline . After the City acquired the BMT and IRT in 1940 , the Independent lines were dubbed the IND to follow the three - letter initialisms of the other systems .
