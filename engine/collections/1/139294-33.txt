In practice , stem cells are identified by whether they can regenerate tissue . For example , the defining test for bone marrow or hematopoietic stem cells ( HSCs ) is the ability to transplant the cells and save an individual without HSCs . This demonstrates that the cells can produce new blood cells over a long term . It should also be possible to isolate stem cells from the transplanted individual , which can themselves be transplanted into another individual without HSCs , demonstrating that the stem cell was able to self - renew .
