With the population of women veterans projected to rise from 1.6 million in 2000 to 1.9 million in 2020 , the VA has worked to integrate quality women 's medical services into the VA system . However , studies show that 66.9 percent of women who do not use the VA for women 's services consider private practice physicians more convenient . Also , 48.5 percent of women do not use women 's services at the VA due to a lack of knowledge of VA eligibility and services .
