The impenetrable Venusian cloud cover gave science fiction writers free rein to speculate on conditions at its surface ; all the more so when early observations showed that not only was it similar in size to Earth , it possessed a substantial atmosphere . Closer to the Sun than Earth , the planet was frequently depicted as warmer , but still habitable by humans . The genre reached its peak between the 1930s and 1950s , at a time when science had revealed some aspects of Venus , but not yet the harsh reality of its surface conditions . Findings from the first missions to Venus showed the reality to be quite different , and brought this particular genre to an end . As scientific knowledge of Venus advanced , so science fiction authors tried to keep pace , particularly by conjecturing human attempts to terraform Venus .
