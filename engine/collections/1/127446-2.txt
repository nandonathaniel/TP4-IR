Based on data from the decennial census , each state is allocated a proportion of the 435 seats in the United States House of Representatives , although each state is guaranteed a minimum of one seat , regardless of population . This apportionment is based on the proportion of each state 's population to that of the Fifty States together ( without regard to the populations of the District of Columbia , the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico or other U.S. dependencies ) . The Electoral College is the body that , every four years , elects the President and Vice President of the United States . Each state 's representation in the Electoral College is equal to that state 's total number of members in both houses of the United States Congress . The Twenty - third Amendment to the United States Constitution effectively grants the District of Columbia , which is separate from any state , three votes . More precisely , the district gets as many votes in the Electoral College as it would have if it were a state , with the caveat that the district can have no more votes than the least populous state ( which is currently Wyoming ) . Currently , this caveat is a moot point since the District would only be entitled to one Representative if it were a state , and is more populous than only two of the seven states with a single member in the House since 2013 . Since the Constitution guarantees every state at least one Representative and guarantees every state two Senators , it effectively guarantees every state ( and , since the ratification of the 23rd Amendment , the District of Columbia ) at least three electoral votes . Thus , the total representation in the College is 538 members ( equal to 100 senators plus 435 representatives , plus 3 members for the District of Columbia ) .
