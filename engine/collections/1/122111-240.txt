The Hiawatha belt is the national belt of the Iroquois and is represented in the Iroquois Confederacy flag . The belt has four squares and a tree in the middle which represents the original five nations of the Iroquois . Going from left to right the squares represent the Seneca , Cayuga , Oneida and Mohawk . The Onondaga are represented by an eastern white pine which represents the Tree of Peace . Traditionally the Onondaga are the peace keepers of the confederacy . The placement of the nations on the belt represents the actually geographical distribution of the six nations over their shared territory , with the Seneca in the far west and the Mohawk in the far east of Iroquois territory .
