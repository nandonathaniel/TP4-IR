In the 19th Century , Sino - U.S. maritime trade began the history of Chinese Americans . At first only a handful of Chinese came , mainly as merchants , former sailors , to America . The first Chinese people of this wave arrived in the United States around 1815 . Subsequent immigrants that came from the 1820s up to the late 1840s were mainly men . In 1834 Afong Moy became the first female Chinese immigrant to the United States ; she was brought to New York City from her home of Guangzhou by Nathaniel and Frederick Carne , who exhibited her as `` the Chinese Lady '' . By 1848 , there were 325 Chinese Americans . 323 more immigrants came in 1849 , 450 in 1850 and 20,000 in 1852 ( 2,000 in 1 day ) . By 1852 , there were 25,000 ; over 300,000 by 1880 : a tenth of the Californian population -- mostly from six districts of Canton ( Guangdong ) province ( Bill Bryson , p. 143 ) -- who wanted to make their fortune in the 1849 - era California Gold Rush . The Chinese did not , however , only come for the gold rush in California , but also helped build the First Transcontinental Railroad , worked the southern plantations after the Civil War , and participated in setting up California 's agriculture and fisheries . They were also fleeing the Taiping Rebellion that affected their region . From the outset , they were faced with the racism of settled European population , which included massacres and pressuring of Chinese migrants into what became known as Chinatowns . Also with regard to the legal situation , the Chinese were by far more badly posed in the United States than most other ethnic minorities . They had to pay special taxes ( all foreign miners had to pay a tax of $20 a month ) , were not allowed to marry white European partners and could not acquire U.S. citizenship .
