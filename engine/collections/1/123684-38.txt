The earliest Irish coinage was introduced in the year 997 , with a pound divided like the English pound into twenty shillings , each of twelve silver pence . Parity with the pound sterling was established by King John around 1210 , so that Irish silver could move freely into the English economy and help to finance his wars in France . However , from 1460 , Irish coins were minted with a different silver content than those of England , so that the values of the two currencies diverged .
