Fixes three zero - day vulnerabilities . These vulnerabilities were chained together by the NSO Group into the Trident exploit chain . Trident is composed of CVE - 2016 - 4657 , CVE - 2016 - 4655 , and CVE - 2016 - 4656 and uses them in that order . First , Trident 's first stage uses CVE - 2016 - 4657 to exploit WebKit , iOS 's built - in web browser engine , via malicious JavaScript to cause WebKit to execute arbitrary Trident 's second stage malware . Trident 's second stage then downloads the Pegasus spyware package , uses CVE - 2016 - 4655 to locate the kernel , and uses CVE - 2016 - 4656 to disable signature verification in order to allow unsigned code like Pegasus to execute . The second stage malware then uses the previously discovered location of the kernel to install and load Pegasus with kernel privileges , allowing the attacker to steal all data on the phone and spy on the victim 's conversations live .
