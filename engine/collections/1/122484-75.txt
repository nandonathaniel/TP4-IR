Atwood prefers to say that she writes speculative fiction -- a term coined by SF author Robert A. Heinlein . As she told the Guardian , `` Science fiction has monsters and spaceships ; speculative fiction could really happen . '' She used a subtly different phrasing for New Scientist , `` Oryx and Crake is not science fiction . It is fact within fiction . Science fiction is when you have rockets and chemicals . '' So it was very cruel of New Scientist to describe this interview in the contents list as : `` Margaret Atwood explains why science is crucial to her science fiction . '' ... Play it again , Ms Atwood -- this time for the Book - of - the - Month Club : `` Oryx and Crake is a speculative fiction , not a science fiction proper . It contains no intergalactic space travel , no teleportation , no Martians . '' On BBC1 Breakfast News the distinguished author explained that science fiction , as opposed to what she writes , is characterized by `` talking squids in outer space '' .
