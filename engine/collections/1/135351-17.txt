Several weeks later , the Squire introduces Jim and Dr. Livesy to `` Long John '' Silver , a one - legged Bristol tavern - keeper whom he has hired as ship 's cook . ( Silver enhances his outre attributes -- crutch , pirate argot , etc. -- with a talking parrot . ) They also meet Captain Smollett , who tells them that he dislikes most of the crew on the voyage , which it seems everyone in Bristol knows is a search for treasure . After taking a few precautions , however , they set sail on Trelawney 's schooner , the Hispaniola , for the distant island . During the voyage , the first mate , a drunkard , disappears overboard . And just before the island is sighted , Jim -- concealed in an apple barrel -- overhears Silver talking with two other crewmen . Most of them are former `` gentlemen o'fortune '' ( pirates ) from Flint 's crew and have planned a mutiny . Jim alerts the captain , doctor , and squire , and they calculate that they will be seven to 19 against the mutineers and must pretend not to suspect anything until the treasure is found when they can surprise their adversaries .
