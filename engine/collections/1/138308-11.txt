In modern systems , the distributor is omitted and ignition is instead electronically controlled . Much smaller coils are used with one coil for each spark plug or one coil serving two spark plugs ( for example two coils in a four - cylinder engine , or three coils in a six - cylinder engine ) . A large ignition coil puts out about 40 kV , and a small one such as from a lawn mower puts out about 15 kV . These coils may be remotely mounted or they may be placed on top of the spark plug ( coil - on - plug or Direct Ignition ) . Where one coil serves two spark plugs ( in two cylinders ) , it is through the `` wasted spark '' system . In this arrangement , the coil generates two sparks per cycle to both cylinders . The fuel in the cylinder that is nearing the end of its compression stroke is ignited , whereas the spark in its companion that is nearing the end of its exhaust stroke has no effect . The wasted spark system is more reliable than a single coil system with a distributor and less expensive than coil - on - plug .
