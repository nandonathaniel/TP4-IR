A second skyscraper boom began in the early 1960s . Since then , the city has seen the completion of nearly 70 structures rising at least 600 feet ( 183 m ) high , including the twin towers of the World Trade Center . One WTC also known as the North Tower , was the tallest building in the world from 1972 until 1973 and the tallest building in New York City until 2001 . The North Tower , as well as the other six buildings in the World Trade Center complex , were destroyed in the September 11 attacks of 2001 . One World Trade Center began construction in 2006 as the lead building of the new World Trade Center complex ; upon its topping out in May 2013 , the 1,776 - foot ( 541 m ) skyscraper surpassed the Willis Tower to become the tallest building in the United States .
