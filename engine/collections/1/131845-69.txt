The Portuguese presence in East Africa served the purpose of controlling trade within the Indian Ocean and securing the sea routes linking Europe to Asia . Portuguese naval vessels disrupted the commerce of Portugal 's enemies within the western Indian Ocean and the Portuguese demanded high tariffs on items transported through the area , given their strategic control of ports and shipping lanes . The construction of Fort Jesus in Mombasa in 1593 aimed to solidify Portuguese hegemony in the region , but their influence was clipped by the English , Dutch and Omani Arab incursions into the region during the 17th century . The Omani Arabs posed the most direct challenge to Portuguese influence in East Africa , besieging Portuguese fortresses and openly attacking naval vessels . Omani forces captured Fort Jesus in 1698 , only to lose it in a revolt ( 1728 ) , but by 1730 the Omanis had expelled the remaining Portuguese from the Kenyan and Tanzanian coasts . By this time the Portuguese Empire had already lost its interest on the spice - trade sea - route because of the decreasing profitability of that traffic . Portuguese - ruled territories , ports and settlements remained active to the south , in Mozambique , until 1975 .
