Reference groups act as a frame of reference to which people always refer to evaluate their achievements , their role performance , aspirations and ambitions . A reference group can be either from a membership group or non-membership group . An example of a reference group being used would be the determination of affluence . An individual in the U.S. with an annual income of $80,000 , may consider himself affluent if he compares himself to those in the middle of the income strata , who earn roughly $32,000 a year . If , however , the same person considers the relevant reference group to be those in the top 0.1 % of households in the US , those making $1.6 million or more , then the individual 's income of $80,000 would make him or her seem rather poor .
