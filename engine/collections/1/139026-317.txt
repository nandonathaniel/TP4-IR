Although officially neutral , Marshal Philippe PÃ©tain 's `` Vichy regime '' collaborated with the Axis from its creation on 10 July 1940 . It retained full control of the non-occupied part of France until November 1942 -- when the whole of France was occupied by Germany -- and of a large part of France 's colonial empire , until the colonies gradually fell under Free French control .
