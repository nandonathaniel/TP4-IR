In all other cases , however , the Court has only appellate jurisdiction , including the ability to issue writs of mandamus and writs of prohibition to lower courts . It considers cases based on its original jurisdiction very rarely ; almost all cases are brought to the Supreme Court on appeal . In practice , the only original jurisdiction cases heard by the Court are disputes between two or more states .
