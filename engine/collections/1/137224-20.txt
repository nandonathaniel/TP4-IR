In the United States , car flipping can be a hobby for car enthusiasts , or a primary business in the form of state licensed car dealers . Flipping cars is legal if the vehicles are titled in the person 's name or processed through a state licensed dealership . Many states have laws and regulation limiting the number of vehicles a person can flip within each year unless they are a dealer or associate . This number varies from state to state , from 2 to 10 . Car flipping has a larger market and requires less investment than flipping real estate .
