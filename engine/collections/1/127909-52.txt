Most prominently , behavior on parse errors differ . A fatal parse error in XML ( such as an incorrect tag structure ) causes document processing to be aborted . Most content requiring namespaces will not work in HTML , except the built - in support for SVG and MathML in the HTML5 parser along with certain magic prefixes such as xlink . JavaScript processing is a little different in XHTML , with minor changes in case sensitivity to some functions , and further precautions to restrict processing to well - formed content . Scripts must not use the document. write ( ) method ; it is not available for XHTML . The innerHTML property is available , but will not insert non-well - formed content . On the other hand , it can be used to insert well - formed namespaced content into XHTML . Cascading Style Sheets ( CSS ) is also applied slightly differently . Due to XHTML 's case - sensitivity , all CSS selectors become case - sensitive for XHTML documents . Some CSS properties , such as backgrounds , set on the < body > element in HTML are ' inherited upwards ' into the < html > element ; this appears not to be the case for XHTML .
