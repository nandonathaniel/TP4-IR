These census numbers show a 363,000 population increase in the western states and territories between 1860 and 1870 . Some of this increase is because of a high birth rate in the western states and territories , but most is from emigrants moving from the east to the west and new immigration from Europe . Much of the increase in California and Oregon is from emigration by ship , as there was fast and reasonably low cost transportation via east and west coast steamships and the Panama Railroad after 1855 . The census numbers imply at least 200,000 emigrants ( or more ) used some variation of the California / Oregon / Mormon / Bozeman trails to get to their new homes between 1860 and 1870 .
