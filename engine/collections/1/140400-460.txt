Isobel Grey ( formerly Crawley , n√©e Turnbull ) , Baroness Merton ( played by Penelope Wilton ) is Matthew 's widowed mother . Originally from Manchester , she is the daughter of a doctor : Sir John Turnbull . Her first husband Reginald Crawley studied under her father and her brother is also a doctor . Isobel was a nurse during the Boer War and initially helps Dr Clarkson at the village hospital , much to his chagrin ( as she constantly undermines his decisions ) . Upon moving to Downton she and Matthew live in a relatively modest dwelling with a butler , Molesley , and a cook , Mrs Bird . Isobel embodies a different set of values to those of the Crawleys . When she and Matthew first arrive at Downton she tells him that she will not alter her lifestyle , and neither will she succumb to their stereotypes and expectations . A recurring theme during the first two series is the clash between her more modern and liberal values with the traditionalist ideas of Lord Grantham and his family . Despite their disagreements , she and the rest of the Crawleys tolerate each other , largely for Matthew 's sake .
