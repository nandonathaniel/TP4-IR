The polo mallet comprises cane shaft with a rubber - wrapped grip , and a webbed thong , called a sling , for wrapping around the thumb , and a wooden cigar shaped head . The shaft is made of manau - cane ( not bamboo , which is hollow ) although a small number of mallets today are made from Composite materials . Composite materials are usually not preferred by top players , because the shaft of composite mallets ca n't absorb vibrations as well as traditional cane mallets . The mallet head is generally made from a hardwood called tipa , approximately 9 ‚ÅÑ '' inches long . The mallet head weighs from 160 grams ( 5.6 ounces ) to 240 grams ( 8.4 ounces ) , depending on player preference and the type of wood used , and the shaft can vary in weight and flexibility depending on the player 's preference . The weight of the mallet head is of important consideration for the more seasoned players . Female players often use lighter mallets than male players . For some polo players , the length of the mallet depends on the size of the horse : the taller the horse , the longer the mallet . However , some players prefer to use a single length of mallet regardless of the height of the horse . Either way , playing horses of differing heights requires some adjustment by the rider . Variable lengths of the mallet typically range from 50 inches ( 127 centimetres ) to 53 inches ( 134 centimetres ) . The term mallet is used exclusively in US English ; British English prefers the term polo stick . The ball is struck with the broad sides of the mallet head rather than its round and flat tips .
