After refusing to admit that it had any seized firearms , the city revealed in mid-March that it did have a cache of some 1000 firearms seized after the hurricane ; this disclosure came after the NRA filed a motion in court to hold the city in contempt for failure to comply with the U.S. District Court 's earlier order to return all seized firearms . On April 14 , 2006 , it was announced that the city will begin to return seized firearms , however as of early 2008 , many firearms were still in police possession , and the matter was still in court . The matter was finally settled in favor of the NRA in October 2008 . Per the agreement , the city was required to relax the strict proof of ownership requirements previously used , and was to release firearms to their owners with an affidavit claiming ownership and a background check to verify that the owner is legally able to possess a firearm .
