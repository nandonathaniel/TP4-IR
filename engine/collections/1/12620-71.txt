In 1874 , Santa Anna explained in a letter that killing defenders of the Alamo was his only option . The letter stressed that Commander William Travis was to blame for the degree of violence at the Alamo . Santa Anna believed that Travis was overly rude and disrespectful towards him , and had that not happened , he would have allowed Sam Houston to establish a dominant presence there . In his letter , he stated that the disrespect of Travis led to the demise of all of his followers , which he claimed only took a couple hours .
