Michelangelo ( voiced by Townsend Coleman ) -- The orange - masked turtle who wields a pair of nunchakus , which is later changed to a grappling hook . He is the goofy , fun - loving `` party animal '' of the team who often speaks in surfer slang , and is the source for many of the show 's catchphrases , such as `` Cowabunga ! '' . More so than any other Turtle , he is obsessed with pizza and enjoys experimenting with various toppings , even when the other Turtles find it gross . He is also considered to be the least intelligent member of the team , especially by Raphael .
