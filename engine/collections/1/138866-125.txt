In 1690 , John Locke argued that prices vary in proportion to the quantity of money . Locke 's Second Treatise also points towards the heart of the anti-mercantilist critique : that the wealth of the world is not fixed , but is created by human labor ( represented embryonically by Locke 's labor theory of value ) . Mercantilists failed to understand the notions of absolute advantage and comparative advantage ( although this idea was only fully fleshed out in 1817 by David Ricardo ) and the benefits of trade .
