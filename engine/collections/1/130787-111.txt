Some Native American tribes , in particular the Five Civilized Tribes , organized their states with constitutions and capitals in Western style . Others , like the Iroquois , had long - standing , pre-Columbian traditions of a ' capitol ' longhouse where wampum and council fires were maintained with special status . Since they did business with the U.S. Federal Government , these capitals can be seen as officially recognized in some sense .
