For example , in case of Openstack , network is provided by Neutron which leverages many features from the Linux kernel for networking : iptables , iproute2 , L2 bridge , L3 routing or OVS . Since the Linux kernel can not sustain the 10G packet rate , then some bypass technologies for a fast path are used . The main bypass technologies are either based on a limited set of features such as Open vSwitch ( OVS ) with its DPDK user space implementation or based on a full feature and offload of Linux processing such as 6WIND Virtual Accelerator .
