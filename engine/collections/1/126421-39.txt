The Alliance for Affordable Internet ( A4AI ) was launched in October 2013 and Microsoft was part of the coalition of public and private organizations that also included Facebook , Intel and Google . Led by World Wide Web inventor Tim Berners - Lee , the A4AI seeks to make Internet access more affordable so that access is broadened in the developing world , where only 31 % of people are online . Google will help to decrease Internet access prices so that they fall below the UN Broadband Commission 's worldwide target of 5 % of monthly income . In line with the maturing PC business , in July 2013 , Microsoft announced that it would reorganize the business into four new business divisions by function : Operating System , Apps , Cloud , and Devices .
