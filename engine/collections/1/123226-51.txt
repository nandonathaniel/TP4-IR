Article 15 prohibits discrimination on the grounds only of religion , race , caste , sex , place of birth , or any of them . This right can be enforced against the State as well as private individuals , with regard to free access to places of public entertainment or places of public resort maintained partly or wholly out of State funds . However , the State is not precluded from making special provisions for women and children or any socially and educationally backward classes of citizens , including the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes . This exception has been provided since the classes of people mentioned therein are considered deprived and in need of special protection . Article 16 guarantees equality of opportunity in matters of public employment and prevents the State from discriminating against anyone in matters of employment on the grounds only of religion , race , caste , sex , descent , place of birth , place of residence or any of them . It creates exceptions for the implementation of measures of affirmative action for the benefit of any backward class of citizens in order to ensure adequate representation in public service , as well as reservation of an office of any religious institution for a person professing that particular religion .
