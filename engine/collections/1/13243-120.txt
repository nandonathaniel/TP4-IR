`` Pray then like this : ' Our Father in heaven , hallowed be your name . Your kingdom come , your will be done , on earth as it is in heaven . Give us this day our daily bread , and forgive us our debts , as we also have forgiven our debtors . And lead us not into temptation , but deliver us from evil . ' ''
