The Walt Disney Company has become well known for protecting its trademark on the Mickey Mouse character -- whose likeness is closely associated with the company -- with particular zeal . In 1989 , Disney threatened legal action against three daycare centers in Florida for having Mickey Mouse and other Disney characters painted on their walls . The characters were removed , and rival Universal Studios replaced them with Universal cartoon characters .
