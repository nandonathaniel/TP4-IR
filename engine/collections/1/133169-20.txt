Between 1975 and 1979 , after South Vietnam had fallen to North Vietnam , millions of Cambodians emigrated to Thailand to avoid the Khmer Rouge . In response MSF set up its first refugee camp missions in Thailand . When Vietnam withdrew from Cambodia in 1989 , MSF started long - term relief missions to help survivors of the mass killings and reconstruct the country 's health care system . Although its missions to Thailand to help victims of war in Southeast Asia could arguably be seen as its first war - time mission , MSF saw its first mission to a true war zone , including exposure to hostile fire , in 1976 . MSF spent nine years ( 1976 -- 1984 ) assisting surgeries in the hospitals of various cities in Lebanon , during the Lebanese Civil War , and established a reputation for its neutrality and willingness to work under fire . Throughout the war , MSF helped both Christian and Muslim soldiers alike , helping whichever group required the most medical aid at the time . In 1984 , as the situation in Lebanon deteriorated further and security for aid groups was minimised , MSF withdrew its volunteers .
