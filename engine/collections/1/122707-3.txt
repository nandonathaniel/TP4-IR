Simple random sampling is a basic type of sampling , since it can be a component of other more complex sampling methods . The principle of simple random sampling is that every object has the same probability of being chosen . For example , suppose N college students want to get a ticket for a basketball game , but there are only X < N tickets for them , so they decide to have a fair way to see who gets to go . Then , everybody is given a number in the range from 0 to N - 1 , and random numbers are generated , either electronically or from a table of random numbers . Numbers outside the range from 0 to N - 1 are ignored , as are any numbers previously selected . The first X numbers would identify the lucky ticket winners .
