The pyroxene group consists of 21 mineral species . Pyroxenes have a general structure formula of XY ( Si O ) , where X is an octahedral site , while Y can vary in coordination number from six to eight . Most varieties of pyroxene consist of permutations of Ca , Fe and Mg to balance the negative charge on the backbone . Pyroxenes are common in the Earth 's crust ( about 10 % ) and are a key constituent of mafic igneous rocks .
