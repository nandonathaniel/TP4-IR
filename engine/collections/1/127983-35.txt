Tim Jonze of The Guardian described it as `` a ballad , but not so much in the boyband style '' and compared the song to the music of American indie rock band The Walkmen . Jonze also addressed early rumors that the song would be influenced by the music of David Bowie , noting `` If it is indeed Bowie-esque , then it 's the Bowie of Hunky Dory '' . Jamieson Cox in Pitchfork felt the `` skyscraping Bowie ballad '' manages to sound like both fun. 's `` We Are Young '' and Coldplay 's `` The Scientist '' . NPR 's Ann Powers argued the song mirrors more closely `` Britpop anthems '' like Blur 's `` Tender '' or The Verve 's `` Bittersweet Symphony '' `` than anything Bowie released in his prime '' .
