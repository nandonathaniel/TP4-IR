Between 1983 and 1984 , heavy metal went from an 8 percent to a 20 percent share of all recordings sold in the U.S. Several major professional magazines devoted to the genre were launched , including Kerrang ! ( in 1981 ) and Metal Hammer ( in 1984 ) , as well as a host of fan journals . In 1985 , Billboard declared , `` Metal has broadened its audience base . Metal music is no longer the exclusive domain of male teenagers . The metal audience has become older ( college - aged ) , younger ( pre-teen ) , and more female '' .
