The common krait ( Bungarus caeruleus ) is often considered to be the most dangerous snake species in India . Its venom consists mostly of powerful neurotoxins which induce muscle paralysis . Clinically , its venom contains pre synaptic and postsynaptic neurotoxins , which generally affect the nerve endings near the synaptic cleft of the brain . Due to the fact that krait venom contains many presynaptic neurotoxins , patients bitten will often not respond to antivenom because once paralysis has developed it is not reversible . This species causes an estimated 10,000 fatalities per year in India alone . There is a 70 - 80 % mortality rate in cases where there is no possible or poor and ineffective treatment ( e.g. , no use of mechanical ventilation , low quantities of antivenom , poor management of possible infection ) . Average venom yield per bite is 10 mg ( Brown , 1973 ) , 8 to 20 mg ( dry weight ) ( U.S. Dept . Navy , 1968 ) , and 8 to 12 mg ( dry weight ) ( Minton , 1974 ) . The lethal adult human dose is 2.5 mg . In mice , the LD values of its venom are 0.365 mg / kg SC , 0.169 mg / kg IV and 0.089 mg / kg IP .
