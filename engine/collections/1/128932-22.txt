Staff governors ( other than the head teacher ) are elected by the school staff and must be paid to work at the school , by the school ( that is , not under an external contract such as catering or cleaning ) . At least one staff governor must be a teacher , and if there are three or more staff governors , at least one must be a member of the support staff . If no member of the appropriate category stands for election , the vacant place can be filled by an elected person from the other category ( i.e. if no teachers wish to become governors , all staff governors may be support staff , and vice versa ) .
