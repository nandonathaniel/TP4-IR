In 1999 , physical evidence of lion cages was found , one being 3x3 meters ( 6.5 x10 feet ) in size , very small for a lion that can grow to be 2.5 meters ( approximately 8 feet ) long . In 2008 , the skulls of two male Barbary lions ( now extinct in the wild ) from northwest Africa were found in the moat area of the Tower . Radiocarbon tests dated them from 1280 -- 1385 and 1420 -- 1480 . During 2011 an exhibition was hosted at the Tower with fine wire sculptures by Kendra Haste .
