In 2003 , Japanese researcher and mountaineer Dr. Makoto Nebuka published the results of his twelve - year linguistic study , postulating that the word `` Yeti '' is a corruption of the word `` meti '' , a regional dialect term for a `` bear '' . Nebuka claims that ethnic Tibetans fear and worship the bear as a supernatural being . Nebuka 's claims were subject to almost immediate criticism , and he was accused of linguistic carelessness . Dr. Raj Kumar Pandey , who has researched both Yetis and mountain languages , said `` it is not enough to blame tales of the mysterious beast of the Himalayas on words that rhyme but mean different things .
