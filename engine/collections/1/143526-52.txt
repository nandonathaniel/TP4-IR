BPA can disrupt normal , physiological levels of sex hormones . It does this by binding to globulins that normally bind to sex hormones such as androgens and estrogens , leading to the disruption of the balance between the two . BPA can also affect the metabolism or the catabolism of sex hormones . It often acts as an antiandrogen or as an estrogen , which can cause disruptions in gonadal development and sperm production .
