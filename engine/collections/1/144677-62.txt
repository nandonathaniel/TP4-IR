The classical / balance controversy . The classical hypothesis of genetic variability , often associated with Hermann Muller , maintains that most genes are of a normal wild type , and that most individuals are homozygous for that wild type , while most selection is purifying selection that operates to eliminate deleterious alleles . The balancing hypothesis , often associated with Theodosius Dobzhansky , states that heterozygosity will be common at loci , and that it frequently reflects either directional selection or balancing selection .
