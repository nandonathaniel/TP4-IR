I disagree , tables should n't have empty rows . 117Avenue ( talk ) 02 : 38 , 9 August 2013 ( UTC ) Then exclude the parameter . Filling in of values in a list should be encouraged , especially since most of these lists are not always available at the time of building the list . < another old fart > -- Th eDJ ( talk contribs ) 08 : 52 , 9 August 2013 ( UTC ) You could see it like this : The 2nd row is n't actually a row semantically ( even though we define it as such in HTML tables ) , it 's actually the ' last cell ' of a data entry that happens to be on the ' next line ' . When you have empty cells , you do n't remove them , because that breaks the table . -- Th eDJ ( talk contribs ) 08 : 54 , 9 August 2013 ( UTC ) I believe in `` do n't need to say nothing '' . This means that if we do n't know something , or there is n't a good source for something , we do n't say that we do n't know it , we just leave it out of the article . I see an empty cell as throwing my hands up in the air and saying `` I dunno '' . 117Avenue ( talk ) 04 : 46 , 10 August 2013 ( UTC ) The empty cells was one of the reasons this template became so popular . There was only a handful of us , and the template was never any formal proposal or mentioned in any MoS , and yet even totally new users picked it up and spread the template 's use . People saw the empty cell and knew it meant something needed to be filled out .
