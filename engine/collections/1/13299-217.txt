Mae Harrington ( n√©e Maxwell ; January 20 , 1889 -- December 29 , 2002 ) was an American supercentenarian who became the world 's oldest living person upon the death of Adelina Domingues . Harrington was also the oldest living American and the oldest person ever from the state of New York , breaking the record held since the 1920s by then world 's oldest person Delina Filkins , also 113 , but her own record was subsequently broken on May 28 , 2005 by Grace Thaxton , who was born in the state before moving to and dying in Kentucky . Because her age was not authenticated during her lifetime , the public recognition she was due went to another 113 - year - old , Mary Parr ( January 29 , 1889 -- October 29 , 2002 ) , who was born nine days after her , dying two months before her , as her age was only validated posthumously .
