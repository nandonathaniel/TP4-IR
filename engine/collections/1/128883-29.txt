The chance for a shift to sociology came in 1930 , when Harvard 's first Sociology Department was created under Russian scholar Pitirim Sorokin . Sorokin , who had fled the Russian Revolution from Russia to the United States in 1923 , was given the opportunity to establish the department . Parsons became one of the new department 's two instructors , along with Carl Joslyn . Parsons established close ties with biochemist and sociologist Lawrence Joseph Henderson , who took personal interest in Parsons ' career at Harvard . Parsons became part of L.J. Henderson 's famous Pareto study group in which some of the most important intellectuals at Harvard participated , including Crane Brinton , George C. Homans , and Charles P. Curtis . Parsons wrote an article on Pareto 's theory and later explained that he had adopted the concept of `` social system '' from reading Pareto . Parsons also made strong connections with two other influential intellectuals with whom he corresponded for years : economist Frank H. Knight and Chester I. Barnard , one of the most dynamic businessmen of the US . The relationship between Parsons and Sorokin quickly ran sour . A pattern of personal tensions was aggravated by Sorokin 's deep dislike for American civilisation , which he regarded as a sensate culture that was in decline . Sorokin 's writings became increasingly anti-scientistic in his later years , widening the gulf between his work and Parsons ' and turning the increasingly - positivisitic American sociology community against him . Sorokin also tended to belittle all sociology tendencies that differed from his own writings , and by 1934 , Sorokin was quite unpopular at Harvard .
