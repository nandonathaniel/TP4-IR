Federalist representatives were quick to attack Madison 's proposal , fearing that any move to amend the new Constitution so soon after its implementation would create an appearance of instability in the government . The House , unlike the Senate , was open to the public , and members such as Fisher Ames warned that a prolonged `` dissection of the constitution '' before the galleries could shake public confidence . A procedural battle followed , and after initially forwarding the amendments to a select committee for revision , the House agreed to take Madison 's proposal up as a full body beginning on July 21 , 1789 .
