Complicated percussion parts are common in concert band pieces , often requiring many percussionists . Many believe this is a major difference between the orchestra ( which usually lacks a large battery of percussion ) and the concert band . While in older transcriptions and concert works , the timpani were treated as its own section as in the orchestra , today , in bands , the timpani are considered part of the percussion section . Consequently , the timpani player often will double on other percussion instruments .
