Over 80 % of Bulldog litters are delivered by Caesarean section because their characteristically large heads can become lodged in the mother 's birth canal . The folds , or `` rope '' , on a Bulldog 's face should be cleaned daily to avoid infections caused by moisture accumulation . Some Bulldogs ' naturally curling tails can be so tight to the body as to require regular cleaning and ointment . Due to the high volume of skin folds on the Bulldog 's body , they are particularly prone to skin and coat infections such as skin-fold dermatitis , which may result in increased odors emanating from their bodies . Deficiencies in nutrients such as omega 3 and 6 fatty acids , zinc , vitamin A , and vitamin B all can contribute to the health of a bulldog 's skin . Omega 6 fatty acids , zinc and vitamin A aid in keratinization , with omega 6 fatty acids also being important for maintaining moisture levels . If these nutrient requirements are met in the bulldog 's diet , they are much less likely to experience skin problems , therefore reducing odor production as well .
