On September 23 , 2004 , as a result of the 2003 renovation , a 10 - member federal advisory committee unanimously recommended that Soldier Field be delisted as a National Historic Landmark . The recommendation to delist was prepared by Carol Ahlgren , architectural historian at the National Park Service 's Midwest Regional Office in Omaha , Nebraska . Ahlgren was quoted in Preservation Online as stating that `` if we had let this stand , I believe it would have lowered the standard of National Historic Landmarks throughout the country '' , and , `` If we want to keep the integrity of the program , let alone the landmarks , we really had no other recourse . '' The stadium lost the Landmark designation on February 17 , 2006 .
