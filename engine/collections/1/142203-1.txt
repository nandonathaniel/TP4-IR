In all jurisdictions , individual tattooists may also choose to place additional restrictions based on their own moral feelings , such as refusing any clients under a specific age even with parental consent despite it being legal , or limiting the type and / or location of where they are willing to tattoo ( such as refusing any work around intimate parts of the body ) . They may additionally refuse to perform specific artwork , including if they merely find it inappropriate or offensive , or refuse to work on a client that they suspect may be intoxicated . Artists sometimes claim their personal business restrictions are a matter of law even when it is not true , so as to avoid arguments with clients .
