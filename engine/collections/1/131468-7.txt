Homeostasis does not govern every activity in the body . For instance the signal ( be it via neurons or hormones ) from the sensor to the effector is , of necessity , highly variable in order to convey information about the direction and magnitude of the error detected by the sensor . Similarly the effector 's response needs to be highly adjustable to reverse the error -- in fact it should be very nearly in proportion ( but in the opposite direction ) to the error that is threatening the internal environment . For instance , the arterial blood pressure in mammals is homeostatically controlled , and measured by stretch receptors in the walls of the aortic arch and carotid sinuses at beginnings of the internal carotid arteries . The sensors send messages via sensory nerves to the medulla oblongata of the brain indicating whether the blood pressure has fallen or risen , and by how much . The medulla oblongata then distributes messages along motor or efferent nerves belonging to the autonomic nervous system to a wide variety of effector organs , whose activity is consequently changed to reverse the error in the blood pressure . One of the effector organs is the heart whose rate is stimulated to rise ( tachycardia ) when the arterial blood pressure falls , or to slow down ( bradycardia ) when the pressure rises above set point . Thus the heart rate ( for which there is no sensor in the body ) is not homeostatically controlled , but is one of effector responses to errors in the arterial blood pressure . Another example is the rate of sweating . This is one of the effectors in the homeostatic control of body temperature , and therefore highly variable in rough proportion to the heat load that threatens to destabilize the body 's core temperature , for which there is a sensor in the hypothalamus of the brain .
