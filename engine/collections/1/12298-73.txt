In 1963 , Alabama Gov. George Wallace personally blocked the door to Foster Auditorium at the University of Alabama to prevent the enrollment of two black students . This became the infamous Stand in the Schoolhouse Door where Wallace personally backed his `` segregation now , segregation tomorrow , segregation forever '' policy that he had stated in his 1963 inaugural address . He moved aside only when confronted by General Henry Graham of the Alabama National Guard , who was ordered by President John F. Kennedy to intervene .
