In March 2010 EADS and its US partner pulled out of a contract to build air refuelling planes worth $35 billion . They had previously won the bid but it was rerun and EADS claimed the new process was biased towards Boeing . The European Commission said it would be `` highly regrettable '' if the tendering process did prove to be biased . There was substantial opposition to EADS in Washington due to the ongoing Boeing - Airbus ( owned by EADS ) dispute .
