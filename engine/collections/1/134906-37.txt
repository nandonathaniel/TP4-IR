The inward - facing surfaces of the stones are smoother and more finely worked than the outer surfaces . The average thickness of the stones is 1.1 metres ( 3 ft 7 in ) and the average distance between them is 1 metre ( 3 ft 3 in ) . A total of 75 stones would have been needed to complete the circle ( 60 stones ) and the trilithon horseshoe ( 15 stones ) . It was thought the ring might have been left incomplete , but an exceptionally dry summer in 2013 revealed patches of parched grass which may correspond to the location of removed sarsens . The lintel stones are each around 3.2 metres ( 10 ft ) long , 1 metre ( 3 ft 3 in ) wide and 0.8 metres ( 2 ft 7 in ) thick . The tops of the lintels are 4.9 metres ( 16 ft ) above the ground .
