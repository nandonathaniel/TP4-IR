The machine 's BIOS must be set to allow Wake - on - LAN . To allow wakeup from powered - down state S5 , wakeup on PME ( Power Management Event ) is also required . The Intel adapter allows `` Wake on Directed Packet '' , `` Wake on Magic Packet '' , `` Wake on Magic Packet from power off state '' , and `` Wake on Link '' . Wake on Directed Packet is particularly useful as the machine will automatically come out of standby or hibernation when it is referenced , without the user or application needing to explicitly send a magic packet . Unfortunately in many networks waking on directed packet ( any packet with the adapter 's MAC address or IP address ) or on link is likely to cause wakeup immediately after going to a low - power state . Details for any particular motherboard and network adapter are to be found in the relevant manuals ; there is no general method . Knowledge of signals on the network may also be needed to prevent spurious wakening .
