By the 1950s Mohammad Reza Pahlavi was engaged in a power struggle with Iran 's prime minister , Mohammad Mosaddegh , an immediate descendant of the preceding Qajar dynasty . Mosaddegh led a general strike on behalf of impoverished Iranians , demanding a share of the nation 's petroleum revenue from Britain 's Anglo - Iranian Oil Company . However , he overstepped in trying to get $50 million in damages and lost revenue from the British . In 1953 , the British and American spy agencies helped Iranian royalists depose Mosaddegh in a military coup d'Ã©tat codenamed Operation Ajax , allowing the Shah to extend his power . The Shah appointed himself an absolute monarch rather than a constitutional monarch , his position before the 1953 crisis , with the aim of assuming complete control of the government and purging the disloyal . The U.S. continued to support and fund the Shah after the coup , with the Central Intelligence Agency training the government 's SAVAK secret police . In the subsequent decades of the Cold War , various economic , cultural , and political issues united opposition against the Shah and led to his overthrow .
