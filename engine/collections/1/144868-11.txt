Eisenhower introduced four propeller driven aircraft to presidential service . This group included two Lockheed C - 121 Constellations , the aircraft Columbine II ( VC - 121A 48 - 610 ) -- the only primary presidential airplane ever sold -- and Columbine III ( VC - 121E 53 - 7885 ) . They were named by First Lady Mamie Eisenhower after the columbine , the official state flower of her adopted home state of Colorado . Two Aero Commanders were added to the fleet and earned the distinction of being the smallest aircraft ever to serve as Air Force One . President Eisenhower also upgraded Air Force One 's technology by adding an air - to - ground telephone and an air - to - ground teletype machine .
