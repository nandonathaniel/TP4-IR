A year later , on 6 November 2007 , Prime Minister Gordon Brown unveiled the government 's plans in his Queen 's Speech . The plans included the duty for parents to assist their children in education or training participation until the date of their 18th birthday , as well as detailing proposed moves to reform the apprenticeship system and to improve achievement for children in care . The Education and Skills Act 2008 , when it came into force in the 2013 academic year , initially required participation in some form of education or training until the school year in which the child turned 17 , followed by the age being raised to the young person 's 18th birthday in 2015 . This was referred to as raising the `` participation age '' to distinguish it from the school leaving age which remains at 16 . To qualify as participation the young person must be in education or training for the equivalent of one day a week ( at a minimum ) . The local council is responsible for ensuring that a suitable place is available . The Act makes similar powers available to the National Assembly for Wales . A spokesperson for the Welsh Assembly indicated that it would want to encourage more young people to stay in education , but without compulsion , so school leavers there are not required to continue with any education or training .
