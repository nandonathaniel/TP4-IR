During polymerization , a polymer spends most of its time in increasing its chain length , or propagating . After the radical initiator is formed , it attacks a monomer ( Figure 11 ) . In an ethene monomer , one electron pair is held securely between the two carbons in a sigma bond . The other is more loosely held in a pi bond . The free radical uses one electron from the pi bond to form a more stable bond with the carbon atom . The other electron returns to the second carbon atom , turning the whole molecule into another radical . This begins the polymer chain . Figure 12 shows how the orbitals of an ethylene monomer interact with a radical initiator .
