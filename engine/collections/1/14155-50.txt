The Obradoiro square in front of the façade alludes to the workshop ( obradoiro , in Galician ) of stonemasons who worked on the square during the construction of the cathedral . In order to protect the Pórtico da Gloria from deterioration caused by weather , this façade and towers have had several reforms since the 16th century . In the 18th century it was decided to build the current Baroque façade , designed by Fernando de Casas Novoa . It has large glazed windows that illuminate the ancient Romanesque façade and is located between the towers of the Bells and of the Ratchet . In the middle of the central body is St. James and one level below his two disciples Athanasius and Theodore , all dressed as pilgrims . In between , the urn ( representing the found tomb ) and the star ( representing the lights he saw the Hermit Pelagius ) between angels and clouds . The tower on the right depicts Mary Salome , mother of St. James , and the tower on the left depicts his father Zebedee . The balustrade on the left side depicts St. Susanna and St. John and the one on the right depicts St. Barbara and James the Less .
