The indigenous peoples of the Willamette River practiced a variety of life ways . Those on the lower river , slightly closer to the coast , often relied on fishing as their primary economic mainstay . Salmon was the most important fish to Willamette River tribes as well as to the Native Americans of the Columbia River , where white traders traded fish with the Native Americans . Upper - river tribes caught steelhead and salmon , often by building weirs across tributary streams . Tribes of the northern Willamette Valley practiced a generally settled lifestyle . The Chinooks lived in great wooden lodges , practiced slavery , and had a well - defined caste system . People of the south were more nomadic , traveling from place to place with the seasons . They were known for the controlled burning of woodlands to create meadows for hunting and plant gathering ( especially camas ) .
