Notable ANC members Ahmed Kathrada and Derek Hanekom called on the ANC to address public concerns relating to Zuma 's relationship with the Gupta family . Prior to criticising financial institutions for refusing to do business with Oakbay the trade union COSATU called for president Zuma to distance himself from the Gupta family . Following Kathrada 's death in March 2017 , Zuma was not invited to his funeral at Kathradas family 's request due to Zuma 's controversial relationship with the Gupta family , and former president Kgalema Motlanthe read an open letter that Kathrada had published a year before his death calling on Zuma to resign .
