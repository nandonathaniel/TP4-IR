The extensive revisions James made for the 1908 New York Edition have generally been accepted as improvements , unlike the changes he made to other texts , such as The American or Roderick Hudson . The revision of the final scene between Isabel and Goodwood has been especially applauded . As Edward Wagenknecht noted , James `` makes it as clear as any modern novelist could make it by using all the four - letter words in the dictionary that ( Isabel ) has been roused as never before in her life , roused in the true sense perhaps for the first time in her life . '' James 's verbal magic allowed him to both obey and evade the restrictive conventions of his day for the treatment of sexuality in literature .
