Gioachino Rossini used this anthem in the last scene of his `` Il viaggio a Reims '' , when all the characters , coming from many different European countries , sing a song which recalls their own homeland . Lord Sidney , bass , sings `` Della real pianta '' on the notes of `` God Save the King '' . Samuel Ramey used to interpolate a spectacular virtuoso cadenza at the end of the song .
