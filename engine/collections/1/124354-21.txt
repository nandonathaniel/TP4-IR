In Indonesia , CB radios were first introduced about 1977 when some transceivers were imported illegally from Australia , Japan and the United States . The dates are hard to confirm accurately , but early use was known around large cities such as Jakarta , Bandung , Yogyakarta , Surabaya and Medan . The Indonesian government legalized CB on 6 October 1980 with a decision by the Minister of Communications , the `` Ministerial Decree on the Licensing for the Operation of Inter-Citizens Radio Communication '' . Because many people were already using 40 - channel radios prior to legalization , the American band plan ( with AM and SSB ) was adopted ; a VHF band was added in 1994 , along with allowing use of the Australian UHF CB channel plan at 476 - 477 MHz On November 10 , 1980 , the Indonesian Directorate General of Posts and Telecommunications issued another decree establishing RAPI ( Radio Antar Penduduk Indonesia ) as the official citizens band radio organization in Indonesia .
