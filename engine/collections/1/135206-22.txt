A 2006 study by Zanella , Gurioli , Pareschi , and Lanza used the magnetic characteristics of over 200 samples of lithic , roof - tile , and plaster fragments collected from pyroclastic deposits in and around Pompeii to estimate the equilibrium temperatures of the deposits . The deposits were placed by pyroclastic density currents ( PDCs ) resulting from the collapses of the Plinian column . The authors argue that fragments over 2 -- 5 cm ( 0.8 -- 2 in ) were not in the current long enough to acquire its temperature , which would have been much higher , and therefore they distinguish between the depositional temperatures , which they estimated , and the emplacement temperatures , which in some cases based on the cooling characteristics of some types and fragment sizes of rocks they believed they also could estimate . Final figures are considered to be those of the rocks in the current just before deposition .
