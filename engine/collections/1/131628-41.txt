The Community Service Scholarship Program at California State University - Fresno combines cooperative education with service learning . Students receive co-op / internship credit and scholarships for completing a placement at a community service site ( Derousi & Sherwood 1997 ) . As in traditional co-op work placements , students get real - world training , opportunities to explore career options , and enhanced employability skills such as communication , problem solving , and leadership as well as awareness of community and social problems . Combining co-op and service learning thus prepares students for roles as workers and citizens .
