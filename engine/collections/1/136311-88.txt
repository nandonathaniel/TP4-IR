The influence of classical conditioning can be seen in emotional responses such as phobia , disgust , nausea , anger , and sexual arousal . A familiar example is conditioned nausea , in which the CS is the sight or smell of a particular food that in the past has resulted in an unconditioned stomach upset . Similarly , when the CS is the sight of a dog and the US is the pain of being bitten , the result may be a conditioned fear of dogs .
