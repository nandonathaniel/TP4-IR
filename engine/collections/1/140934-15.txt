The sisters began to harmonize together when a then 5 year - old Tamar demanded , `` Somebody get me some toilet paper ! '' Each sister and brother Michael soon after went in the bathroom and began singing the `` Toilet Paper Song . '' The Braxtons credit this incident as their first song - writing experience and the first time that they harmonized as a group . Growing up , they sang in the choir at several churches and toured the East Coast with their religious parents singing at various events .
