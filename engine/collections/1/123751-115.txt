The U.S. government has officially taken a silent policy towards the nuclear weapons ambitions of the state of Israel , while being exceedingly vocal against proliferation of such weapons in the countries of Iran and North Korea . Until 2005 when the program was cancelled , it was violating its own non-proliferation treaties in the pursuit of so - called nuclear bunker busters . The 2003 invasion of Iraq by the U.S. was done , in part , on indications that Weapons of Mass Destruction were being stockpiled ( lately , stockpiles of previously undeclared nerve agent and mustard gas shells have been located in Iraq ) , and the Bush administration said that its policies on proliferation were responsible for the Libyan government 's agreement to abandon its nuclear ambitions .
