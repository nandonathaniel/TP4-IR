In China , video game consoles were banned in June 2000 . This has led to an explosion in the popularity of computer games , especially MMOs . Consoles and the games for them are easily acquired however , as there is a robust grey market importing and distributing them across the country . Another side effect of this law has been increased copyright infringement of video games .
