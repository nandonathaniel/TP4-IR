In season 8 , a year after Robert Fuller became scout Cooper Smith , it was revealed ( in `` The Bob Stuart Story '' , ep 1 , Sept. 1964 ) that , ten years earlier , Cooper Smith had been the leader of supposedly the most determined guns - for - hire team in what was described as ' the Kansas range war ' . He had been persuaded to leave this line of work when he was hospitalized after a marshal shot him in the back with a shotgun .
