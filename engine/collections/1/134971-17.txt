Naismith 's original rules did not specify how many players were to be on the court . In 1900 , five players became standard , and players that were substituted were not allowed to re-enter the game . Players were allowed to re-enter a game once from 1921 , and twice from 1934 ; such restrictions on substitutions were abolished in 1945 when substitutions became unlimited . Coaching was originally prohibited during the game , but from 1949 , coaches were allowed to address players during a time - out .
