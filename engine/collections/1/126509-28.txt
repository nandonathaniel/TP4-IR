Theodore Roosevelt believed that a US - controlled canal across Central America was a vital strategic interest of the country . This idea gained wide circulation after the destruction of the USS Maine in Cuba on February 15 , 1898 . Reversing a Walker Commission decision in favor of a Nicaraguan canal , Roosevelt encouraged the acquisition of the French Panama Canal effort . George S. Morison was the only commission member who argued for the Panama location . The purchase of the French - held land for $40 million was authorized by the June 28 , 1902 Spooner Act . Since Panama was then part of Colombia , Roosevelt began negotiating with that country to obtain the necessary rights . In early 1903 the Hay -- Herr√°n Treaty was signed by both nations , but the Senate of Colombia failed to ratify the treaty .
