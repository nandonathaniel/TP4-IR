If Wishes Were Horses is the name of the second album of the Canadian glam rock band , Sweeney Todd . The title track was sung by a then 15 year old Bryan Adams in his first band , who replaced Nick Gilder as the front man . Apparently unaware it was more than just a proverb , producer Martin Shaer wrote new lyrics for it : If wishes were horses , beggars would ride , All dreams and desires would ride alongside , Worries and troubles would fall off behind . If wishes were horses , beggars would ride .
