Guadalcanal , fought from August 1942 to February 1943 , was the first major Allied offensive of the war in the Pacific Theater . This campaign pitted American air , naval and ground forces ( later augmented by Australians and New Zealanders ) against determined Japanese resistance . Guadalcanal was the key to control the Solomon Islands , which both sides saw as strategically essential . Both sides won some battles but both sides were overextended in terms of supply lines . Logistical failures in a hostile physical environment hampered everyone . As happened time and again in the Pacific , the Japanese logistical support system failed , as only 20 % of the supplies dispatched from Rabaul to Guadalcanal ever reached there . Consequently , the 30,000 Japanese troops lacked heavy equipment , adequate ammunition and even enough food ; 10,000 were killed , 10,000 starved to death , and the remaining 10,000 were evacuated in February 1943 . In the end Guadalcanal was a major American victory as the Japanese inability to keep pace with the rate of American reinforcements proved decisive . Guadalcanal is an iconic episode in the annals of American military history , underscoring heroic bravery of underequipped individuals in fierce combat with a determined foe .
