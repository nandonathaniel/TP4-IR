All five seasons of Friday Night Lights were filmed in Austin and Pflugerville . With the show yielding roughly $33 million a year in revenue , other states courted the production company after the state of Texas failed to pay all the rebates it had promised to the show 's producers . The Texas legislature authorized funding to match the offers of other states , and the production company preferred to stay near Austin , so the show remained in Texas .
