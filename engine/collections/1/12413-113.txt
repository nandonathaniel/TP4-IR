The population of Hiroshima had reached a peak of over 381,000 earlier in the war but prior to the atomic bombing , the population had steadily decreased because of a systematic evacuation ordered by the Japanese government . At the time of the attack , the population was approximately 340,000 -- 350,000 . Residents wondered why Hiroshima had been spared destruction by firebombing . Some speculated that the city was to be saved for U.S. occupation headquarters , others thought perhaps their relatives in Hawaii and California had petitioned the U.S. government to avoid bombing Hiroshima . More realistic city officials had ordered buildings torn down to create long , straight firebreaks , beginning in 1944 . Firebreaks continued to be expanded and extended up to the morning of August 6 , 1945 .
