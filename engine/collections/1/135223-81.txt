In Information - Driven Business , Robert Hillard proposes an approach to comparing the two approaches based on the information needs of the business problem . The technique shows that normalized models hold far more information than their dimensional equivalents ( even when the same fields are used in both models ) but this extra information comes at the cost of usability . The technique measures information quantity in terms of information entropy and usability in terms of the Small Worlds data transformation measure .
