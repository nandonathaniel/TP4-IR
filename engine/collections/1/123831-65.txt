Although `` swarming '' scales well to tolerate `` flash crowds '' for popular content , it is less useful for unpopular or niche market content . Peers arriving after the initial rush might find the content unavailable and need to wait for the arrival of a `` seed '' in order to complete their downloads . The seed arrival , in turn , may take long to happen ( this is termed the `` seeder promotion problem '' ) . Since maintaining seeds for unpopular content entails high bandwidth and administrative costs , this runs counter to the goals of publishers that value BitTorrent as a cheap alternative to a client - server approach . This occurs on a huge scale ; measurements have shown that 38 % of all new torrents become unavailable within the first month . A strategy adopted by many publishers which significantly increases availability of unpopular content consists of bundling multiple files in a single swarm . More sophisticated solutions have also been proposed ; generally , these use cross-torrent mechanisms through which multiple torrents can cooperate to better share content .
