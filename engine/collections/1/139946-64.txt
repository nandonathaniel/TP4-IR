In 2006 , parents of a 10th - grade high school student in Montgomery County , Texas , demanded the book be banned from their daughter 's English class reading list . Their daughter was assigned the book during Banned Books Week , but stopped reading several pages in due to the offensive language and description of the burning of the Bible . In addition , the parents protested the violence , portrayal of Christians , and depictions of firemen in the novel .
