Brans -- Dicke theory of gravity ( 1961 ) Induced gravity ( 1967 ) , a proposal by Andrei Sakharov according to which general relativity might arise from quantum field theories of matter ƒ ( R ) gravity ( 1970 ) Horndeski theory ( 1974 ) Supergravity ( 1976 ) String theory In the modified Newtonian dynamics ( MOND ) ( 1981 ) , Mordehai Milgrom proposes a modification of Newton 's Second Law of motion for small accelerations The self - creation cosmology theory of gravity ( 1982 ) by G.A. Barber in which the Brans - Dicke theory is modified to allow mass creation Loop quantum gravity ( 1988 ) by Carlo Rovelli , Lee Smolin , and Abhay Ashtekar Nonsymmetric gravitational theory ( NGT ) ( 1994 ) by John Moffat Conformal gravity Tensor -- vector -- scalar gravity ( TeVeS ) ( 2004 ) , a relativistic modification of MOND by Jacob Bekenstein Gravity as an entropic force , gravity arising as an emergent phenomenon from the thermodynamic concept of entropy .
