According to Tim Bartik of the W.E. Upjohn Institute for Employment Research , studies of the effect of right - to - work laws abound , but are not consistent . Studies have found both `` some positive effect on job growth , '' and no effect . Thomas Holmes argues that it is difficult to analyze right - to - work laws by comparing states due to other similarities between states that have passed these laws . For instance , right - to - work states often have some strong pro-business policies , making it difficult to isolate the effect of right - to - work laws . Looking at the growth of states in the Southeast following World War II , Bartik notes that while they have right - to - work laws they have also benefited from `` factors like the widespread use of air conditioning and different modes of transportation that helped decentralize manufacturing '' .
