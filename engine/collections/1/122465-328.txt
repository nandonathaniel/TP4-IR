In some countries , taxicabs are commonly yellow . This practice began in Chicago , where taxi entrepreneur John D. Hertz painted his taxis yellow based on a University of Chicago study alleging that yellow is the color most easily seen at a distance . In Canada and the United States , school buses are almost uniformly painted a yellow color ( often referred to as `` school bus yellow '' ) for purposes of visibility and safety , and British bus operators such as FirstGroup are attempting to introduce the concept there . `` Caterpillar yellow '' and `` high - visibility yellow '' are used for highway construction equipment . In the rules of the road , yellow ( called `` amber '' in Britain ) is a traffic light signal meaning `` slow down '' , `` caution '' , or `` slow speed ahead '' . It is intermediate between green ( go ) and red ( stop ) . In railway signaling , yellow is often the color for warning , slow down , such as with distant signals . Selective yellow is used in some automotive headlamps and fog lights to reduce the dazzling effects of rain , snow , and fog .
