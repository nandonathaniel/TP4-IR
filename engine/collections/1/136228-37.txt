In the 1970s , Lewis Binford suggested that early humans were obtaining food via scavenging , not hunting . Early humans in the Lower Paleolithic lived in forests and woodlands , which allowed them to collect seafood , eggs , nuts , and fruits besides scavenging . Rather than killing large animals for meat , according to this view , they used carcasses of such animals that had either been killed by predators or that had died of natural causes . Archaeological and genetic data suggest that the source populations of Paleolithic hunter - gatherers survived in sparsely wooded areas and dispersed through areas of high primary productivity while avoiding dense forest cover .
