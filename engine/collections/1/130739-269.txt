All streets and avenues in Miami - Dade County follow the Miami Grid , with a few exceptions , most notably Coral Gables , Hialeah , Coconut Grove and Miami Beach . One neighborhood , The Roads , is thusly named because its streets run off the Miami Grid at a 45 - degree angle , and therefore are all named roads .
