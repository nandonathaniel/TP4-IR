Like other common water additives such as chlorine , hydrofluosilicic acid and sodium silicofluoride decrease pH and cause a small increase of corrosivity , but this problem is easily addressed by increasing the pH . Although it has been hypothesized that hydrofluosilicic acid and sodium silicofluoride might increase human lead uptake from water , a 2006 statistical analysis did not support concerns that these chemicals cause higher blood lead concentrations in children . Trace levels of arsenic and lead may be present in fluoride compounds added to water , but no credible evidence exists that their presence is of concern : concentrations are below measurement limits .
