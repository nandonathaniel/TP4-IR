The gun salute system was used to set unambiguously the precedence of the major rulers in the area in which the British East India Company was active , or generally of the states and their dynasties . As heads of a state , certain princely rulers were entitled to be saluted by the firing of an odd number of guns between three and 21 , with a greater number of guns indicating greater prestige . Generally , the number of guns remained the same for all successive rulers of a particular state , but individual princes were sometimes granted additional guns on a personal basis . Furthermore , rulers were sometimes granted additional gun salutes within their own territories only , constituting a semi-promotion . The states of all these rulers ( about 120 ) were known as salute states .
