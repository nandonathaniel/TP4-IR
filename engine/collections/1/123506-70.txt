Titanic was laid out in a much lighter style similar to that of contemporary high - class hotels -- the Ritz Hotel was a reference point -- with First Class cabins finished in the Empire style . A variety of other decorative styles , ranging from the Renaissance to Louis XV , were used to decorate cabins and public rooms in First and Second Class areas of the ship . The aim was to convey an impression that the passengers were in a floating hotel rather than a ship ; as one passenger recalled , on entering the ship 's interior a passenger would `` at once lose the feeling that we are on board ship , and seem instead to be entering the hall of some great house on shore '' .
