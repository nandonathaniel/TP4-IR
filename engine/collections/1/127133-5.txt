Galileo 's discovery proved the importance of the telescope as a tool for astronomers by showing that there were objects in space to be discovered that until then had remained unseen by the naked eye . More importantly , the discovery of celestial bodies orbiting something other than Earth dealt a blow to the then - accepted Ptolemaic world system , which held that Earth was at the center of the universe and all other celestial bodies revolved around it . Galileo 's Sidereus Nuncius ( Starry Messenger ) , which announced celestial observations through his telescope , does not explicitly mention Copernican heliocentrism , a theory that placed the Sun at the center of the universe . Nevertheless , Galileo accepted the Copernican theory .
