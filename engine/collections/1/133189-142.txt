In early 2001 , Ahmad Shah Massoud with ethnic leaders from all of Afghanistan addressed the European Parliament in Brussels asking the international community to provide humanitarian help to the people of Afghanistan . He stated that the Taliban and Al - Qaeda had introduced `` a very wrong perception of Islam '' and that without the support of Pakistan and Bin Laden the Taliban would not be able to sustain their military campaign for up to a year . On this visit to Europe he also warned that his intelligence had gathered information about a large - scale attack on U.S. soil being imminent . The president of the European Parliament , Nicole Fontaine , called him the `` pole of liberty in Afghanistan '' .
