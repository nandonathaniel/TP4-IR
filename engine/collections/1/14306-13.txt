Prion aggregates are extremely stable and accumulate in infected tissue , causing tissue damage and cell death . This structural stability means that prions are resistant to denaturation by chemical and physical agents , making disposal and containment of these particles difficult . Prion structure varies slightly between species , but nonetheless prion replication is subject to epimutation and natural selection just like other forms of replication .
