Kirchhoff in 1860 introduced the theoretical concept of a perfect black body with a completely absorbing surface layer of infinitely small thickness , but Planck noted some severe restrictions upon this idea . Planck noted three requirements upon a black body : the body must ( i ) allow radiation to enter but not reflect ; ( ii ) possess a minimum thickness adequate to absorb the incident radiation and prevent its re-emission ; ( iii ) satisfy severe limitations upon scattering to prevent radiation from entering and bouncing back out . As a consequence , Kirchhoff 's perfect black bodies that absorb all the radiation that falls on them can not be realized in an infinitely thin surface layer , and impose conditions upon scattering of the light within the black body that are difficult to satisfy .
