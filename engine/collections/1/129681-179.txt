Arnold Schwarzenegger was reported as considering challenging the prevailing interpretation of the clause . In 2003 , Senator Orrin Hatch unsuccessfully put forth the Equal Opportunity to Govern Amendment , intending to allow eligibility for Arnold Schwarzenegger . In October 2013 , the New York Post reported that Schwarzenegger -- who is originally from Austria and became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 1983 , also retaining Austrian citizenship -- was exploring a future run for the American presidency . He reportedly lobbied legislators about a possible constitutional change , or filing a legal challenge to the provision . Cornell University law professor Michael C. Dorf observed that Schwarzenegger 's possible lawsuit could ultimately win him the right to run for the office , noting , `` The law is very clear , but it 's not 100 percent clear that the courts would enforce that law rather than leave it to the political process '' . Schwarzenegger subsequently denied that he was running .
