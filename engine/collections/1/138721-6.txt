Gene conversion can be one of the major forms of non-Mendelian inheritance . Gene conversion arises during DNA repair via DNA recombination , by which a piece of DNA sequence information is transferred from one DNA helix ( which remains unchanged ) to another DNA helix , whose sequence is altered . This may occur as a mismatch repair between the strands of DNA which are derived from different parents . Thus the mismatch repair can convert one allele into the other . This phenomenon can be detected through the offspring non-Mendelian ratios , and is frequently observed , e.g. , in fungal crosses .
