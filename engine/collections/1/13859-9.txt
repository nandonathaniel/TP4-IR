The term of the Legislative Assembly is five years . However , it may be dissolved earlier than that by the Governor on the request of the Chief Minister . The term of the Legislative Assembly may be extended during an emergency , but not more than six months at a time . The Legislative Council is the Upper House in the State . Just like the Rajya Sabha it is a permanent House . The members of the state 's upper house are selected based on the strength of each party in the lower house and by state gubernatorial nomination . The term of is six years , and a third of the members of the House retire after every two years . The upper house of a state assembly , unlike the Upper house of the Parliament , can be abolished by the lower house , if it passes a specific law bill , which states to dissolve the upper house , and gets it attested in both houses of parliament and then signed by the president into law . Only Andhra Pradesh , Bihar , Jammu and Kashmir , Karnataka , Maharashtra , Telangana , and Uttar Pradesh have their upper houses in existence with 6 year term , J&K also has 6 year term lower house . All other states have abolished the upper house by the above - mentioned method , as the upper house causes unnecessary problems and issues .
