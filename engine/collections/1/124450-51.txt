Two justices died in office during Johnson 's administration , James Moore Wayne and John Catron . Congress , however , passed the Judicial Circuits Act of 1866 , which provided for a gradual elimination of seats until only seven were left . Chief Justice Salmon P. Chase had urged for this reduction in the hopes that it would result in an increase of the justices ' salaries , which , ironically , did not happen until Congress restored the size of the court to nine members in 1871 . Johnson had nominated Henry Stanbery to be an Associate Justice , but due to the reduction of seats , this nomination was nullified .
