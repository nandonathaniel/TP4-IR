A large circular projection panel dubbed `` Mr Screen '' first made an appearance during performances of Dark Side of the Moon in 1974 and became a staple thereafter . Specially recorded films and animations were projected onto it , and for 1977 `` In the Flesh '' and 1980 -- 1981 `` The Wall Live '' tours , coloured spotlights were fixed around the rim , an effect which reached its zenith with the dancing patterns of multi-coloured lights in the A Momentary Lapse of Reason and Division Bell tours . In the latter , the screen could be retracted behind the stage when not required , and was tilted horizontally with its peripheral lights focused onto the stage into a single spotlight during the final guitar solo in `` Comfortably Numb '' .
