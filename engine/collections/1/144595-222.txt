According to Edgar Polom√© , 30 % of non-Indo - European substratum found in modern German derives from non-Indo - European - speakers of Funnelbeaker Culture indigenous to southern Scandinavia . When Yamnaya Indo - European speakers came into contact with the indigenous peoples during the 3rd millennium BCE , they came to dominate the local populations yet parts of the indigenous lexicon persisted in the formation of Proto - Germanic , thus giving German the status of being an Indo - Europeanized language . According to Marija Gimbutas , Corded Ware cultures migration to Scandinavia `` synthesized '' with the Funnelbeaker culture , giving birth to the Proto - Germanic language .
