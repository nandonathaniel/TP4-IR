In contrast , the `` XX '' twenty - round box magazine was light and compact , it tended not to rattle , and could be inserted with the bolt safely closed . It was quickly attached and detached and was removed downward , making clearing jams easier . The box tripped the bolt open lock when empty , facilitating magazine changes . An empty box was easily reloaded with loose rounds . However , users complained it was limited in capacity . In the field , some soldiers taped two `` XX '' magazines together in what would be known as `` jungle style '' to speed magazine changes .
