Each of the three main populations should be managed as a separate biological entity so as to avoid numbers dropping below 500 . While the birds may be in decline in the wild , notably higher populations of captive macaws are being held in zoos and private collections . If success in managing and replanting the macaw 's food trees and erecting nest boxes as an experiment in the Pantanals is seen , the species could survive . Survival rates could also be enhanced if ranch owners would leave all large and potential nest trees standing and eliminate all trapping on their properties . Ultimately , should these factors work in tandem with erection of nest boxes , fencing off of certain saplings , and the planting of others , the long - term prospects of the hyacinth macaw species would be greatly improved .
