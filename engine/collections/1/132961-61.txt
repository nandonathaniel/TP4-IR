In December 1962 , 20th Century Fox president Richard D. Zanuck hired Ernest Lehman to write the screenplay for the film adaptation of the stage musical . Lehman reviewed the original script for the stage musical , rearranged the sequence of songs , and began transforming a work designed for the stage into a film that could use the camera to emphasize action and mood , and open the story up to the beautiful locations of Salzburg and the Austrian Alps . The `` Do - Re-Mi '' sequence in the play , for example , was originally a stagnant number ; Lehman transformed it into a lively montage showing some of the beautiful sites of Salzburg , as well as showing Maria and the children growing closer over time . Lehman also eliminated two songs , `` How Can Love Survive ? '' and `` No Way to Stop It '' , sung by the characters of Elsa and Max . In January 1963 , he saw the Fox English - dubbed version of the two German films , was not especially impressed , and decided to use the stage musical and Maria 's memoir for most of his source material . While Lehman was developing the screenplay , he and Zanuck began looking for a director . Their first choice was Robert Wise , with whom Lehman had worked on the film adaptation of West Side Story , but Wise was busy preparing work for another film , The Sand Pebbles . Other directors were approached and turned down the offer , including Stanley Donen , Vincent J. Donehue , George Roy Hill , and Gene Kelly .
