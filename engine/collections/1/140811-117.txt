Tanks were primarily used on the Western Front . The first offensive of the war in which tanks were used en masse was the battle of Cambrai in 1917 ; 476 tanks started the attack , and the German front collapsed . At midday the British had advanced five miles behind the German line . The battle of Amiens in 1918 saw the value of the tank being appreciated ; 10 heavy and two light battalions of 414 tanks were included in the assault . 342 Mark Vs and 72 Whippets were backed up by a further 120 tanks designed to carry forward supplies for the armour and infantry . By the end of the first day of the attack , they had penetrated the German line by 6 -- 8 mi ( 9.7 -- 12.9 km ) , 16,000 prisoners were taken . In September 1918 , the British Army was the most mechanised army in the world . Some 22,000 men had served in the Tank Corps by the end of the war .
