Almost 85 percent of the ice cover on Kilimanjaro disappeared from October 1912 to June 2011 , with coverage decreasing from 11.40 square kilometres ( 4.40 sq mi ) to 1.76 square kilometres ( 0.68 sq mi ) . From 1912 to 1953 , there was about a 1.1 percent average annual loss . The average annual loss for 1953 to 1989 was 1.4 percent while the loss rate for 1989 to 2007 was 2.5 percent . Of the ice cover still present in 2000 , almost 40 percent had disappeared by 2011 . The glaciers are thinning in addition to losing areal coverage , and do not have active accumulation zones with retreat occurring on all glacier surfaces . Loss of glacier mass is caused by both melting and sublimation . While the current shrinking and thinning of Kilimanjaro 's ice fields appears to be unique within its almost twelve millennium history , it is contemporaneous with widespread glacier retreat in mid-to - low latitudes across the globe . At the current rate , most of the ice on Kilimanjaro will disappear by 2040 and `` it is highly unlikely that any ice body will remain after 2060 '' .
