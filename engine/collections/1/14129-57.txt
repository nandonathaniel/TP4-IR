Asbestos production began in the Urals of the Russian Empire in the 1880s , and in the Alpine regions of Northern Italy with the formation in Turin of the Italo - English Pure Asbestos Company in 1876 , although this was soon swamped by the greater production levels from the Canadian mines . Mining also took off in South Africa from 1893 under the aegis of the British businessman Francis Oates , the Director of the De Beers company . It was in South Africa that the production of amosite began in 1910 . The U.S. asbestos industry had an early start in 1858 , when fibrous anthophyllite was mined for use as asbestos insulation by the Johns Company , a predecessor to the current Johns Manville , at a quarry at Ward 's Hill on Staten Island , New York . US production began in earnest in 1899 , with the discovery of large deposits in the Belvidere Mountain .
