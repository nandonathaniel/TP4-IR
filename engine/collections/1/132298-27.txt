Accelerator stops and redirects Misaka 's attacks back at her using vector transformation , controlling elements like kinetic momentum , heat or electrical charge by touch . When Tōma returns from the bookstore , he finds Misaka 's dead body in the dark alley and calls the police department , but the body has gone missing when trying to find it . A confused Tōma continues to search the alley , soon relieved to find Misaka alive but horrified to see her carrying a body bag containing the body he had seen in the alley . Dozens of identical girls resembling Misaka then appear , revealing that they are all part of a confidential experiment and are mass - produced military - use somatic cell clones of Mikoto Misaka called the Sisters , in which the one he has already encountered , currently carrying the body bag , is named Misaka 10032 . Tōma plans to go see Mikoto at her dormitory to learn the truth behind the Sisters , considering how Mikoto treated Misaka earlier . However , he ends up waiting alongside Kuroko , who is Mikoto 's roommate , but is forced to hide under Mikoto 's bed when the Tokiwadai Dorm Supervisor comes by for inspection . Tōma finds and reads a report about Tree Diagram 's calculated methods for how Accelerator , the most powerful Level 5 esper in Academy City , can evolve to Level 6 by fighting the Sisters at special battlefields where he will gain experience from combat and finds a map with several red X marks on it . Now aware of the truth , Tōma goes to confront Mikoto .
