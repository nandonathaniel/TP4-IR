Then , to make up for the great loss of this dog by the blood of a second , I introduced blood from the cervical artery of a fairly large mastiff , which had been fastened alongside the first , until this latter animal showed ... it was overfilled ... by the inflowing blood . '' After he `` sewed up the jugular veins , '' the animal recovered `` with no sign of discomfort or of displeasure . ''
