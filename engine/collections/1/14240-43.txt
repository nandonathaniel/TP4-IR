In Germany , `` Black Friday '' retailer advertisements refer to `` Black Week '' and `` Black Shopping '' in English language , with sales lasting an entire week ( excluding Sundays when most retail stores are closed ) . During this sale time , stores keep their normal working hours ; and though goods are offered at reduced prices , the prices are no more significantly slashed than normal weekly price reductions . Apple was the first company to run a special Black Friday campaign for the German market in 2006 . In the first years , mostly internet retailers have used the event as an occasion to attract new customers with discounts , but bricks and mortar stores have already begun to adapt the shopping event . For the first time ever , German customers spent more than € 1 billion during the Black Friday weekend in 2016 : According to a Centre for Retail Research study , German customers spend around € 1.3 billion ( $ 1.54 billion ) during the four days from Black Friday to Cyber Monday 2016 .
