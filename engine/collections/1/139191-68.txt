The victory claims that were made by each side in the immediate aftermath of the Battle of Hampton Roads , based as both were on misinterpretations of the opponent 's behavior , have been dismissed by present - day historians . They agree that the result of the Monitor -- Merrimack encounter was not a victory for either side . As the combat between ironclads was the primary significance of the battle , the general verdict is that the overall result was a draw . All would acknowledge that the Southern fleet inflicted far more damage than it received , which would ordinarily imply that they had gained a tactical victory . Compared to other Civil War battles , the loss of men and ships for the Union Navy would be considered a clear defeat . On the other hand , the blockade was not seriously threatened , so the entire battle can be regarded as an assault that ultimately failed .
