Tetraethyllead works as a buffer against microwelds forming between the hot exhaust valves and their seats . Once these valves reopen , the microwelds pull apart and leave the valves with a rough surface that would abrade the seats , leading to valve recession . When lead began to be phased out of motor fuel , the automotive industry began specifying hardened valve seats and upgraded exhaust valve materials to prevent valve recession without lead .
