Since ROM ( at least in hard - wired mask form ) can not be modified , it is really only suitable for storing data which is not expected to need modification for the life of the device . To that end , ROM has been used in many computers to store look - up tables for the evaluation of mathematical and logical functions ( for example , a floating - point unit might tabulate the sine function in order to facilitate faster computation ) . This was especially effective when CPUs were slow and ROM was cheap compared to RAM .
