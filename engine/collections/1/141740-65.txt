According to Nicholson , `` we never did shoot the end of the scene . This movie was pre-lit . You 'd go in , plug in the lights , roll the camera , and shoot . We did the take outside the office and went inside the office , plugged in , lit and rolled . Jonathan Haze was up on my chest pulling my teeth out . And in the take , he leaned back and hit the rented dental machinery with the back of his leg and it started to tip over . Roger did n't even call cut . He leapt onto the set , grabbed the tilting machine , and said ' Next set , that 's a wrap . ' '' By 9 am of the first day , Corman was informed by the production manager that he was behind schedule .
