A Gallup poll printed in the Washington Post revealed that a majority of the American public opposed the AAA . In 1936 , the Supreme Court declared the AAA to be unconstitutional , stating that `` a statutory plan to regulate and control agricultural production , ( is ) a matter beyond the powers delegated to the federal government '' . The AAA was replaced by a similar program that did win Court approval . Instead of paying farmers for letting fields lie barren , this program subsidized them for planting soil enriching crops such as alfalfa that would not be sold on the market . Federal regulation of agricultural production has been modified many times since then , but together with large subsidies is still in effect today .
