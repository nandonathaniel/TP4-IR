Owing to a long - running royalty disagreement , the Beatles were among the last major artists to sign deals with online music services . Residual disagreement emanating from Apple Corps ' dispute with Apple , Inc. , iTunes ' owners , over the use of the name `` Apple '' was also partly responsible for the delay , although in 2008 , McCartney stated that the main obstacle to making the Beatles ' catalogue available online was that EMI `` want ( s ) something we 're not prepared to give them '' . In 2010 , the official canon of thirteen Beatles studio albums , Past Masters , and the Red and Blue greatest - hits albums were made available on iTunes .
