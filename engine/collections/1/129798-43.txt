Snippets of voices between and over the music are another notable feature of the album . During recording sessions , Waters recruited both the staff and the temporary occupants of the studio to answer a series of questions printed on flashcards . The interviewees were placed in front of a microphone in a darkened Studio 3 , and shown such questions as `` What 's your favourite colour ? '' and `` What 's your favourite food ? '' , before moving on to themes more central to the album ( such as madness , violence , and death ) . Questions such as `` When was the last time you were violent ? '' , followed immediately by `` Were you in the right ? '' , were answered in the order they were presented . Roger `` The Hat '' Manifold proved difficult to find , and was the only contributor recorded in a conventional sit - down interview , as by then the flashcards had been mislaid . Waters asked him about a violent encounter he had had with another motorist , and Manifold replied `` ... give ' em a quick , short , sharp shock ... '' When asked about death he responded `` live for today , gone tomorrow , that 's me ... '' Another roadie , Chris Adamson , who was on tour with Pink Floyd , recorded the snippet which opens the album : `` I 've been mad for fucking years -- absolutely years '' . The band 's road manager Peter Watts ( father of actress Naomi Watts ) contributed the repeated laughter during `` Brain Damage '' and `` Speak to Me '' . His second wife , Patricia `` Puddie '' Watts ( now Patricia Gleason ) , was responsible for the line about the `` geezer '' who was `` cruisin ' for a bruisin ' '' used in the segue between `` Money '' and `` Us and Them '' , and the words `` I never said I was frightened of dying '' heard halfway through `` The Great Gig in the Sky '' .
