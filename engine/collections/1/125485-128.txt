Diffusion of crude natural gas through special semipermeable membranes and other barriers is another method to recover and purify helium . In 1996 , the U.S. had proven helium reserves , in such gas well complexes , of about 147 billion standard cubic feet ( 4.2 billion SCM ) . At rates of use at that time ( 72 million SCM per year in the U.S. ; see pie chart below ) this would have been enough helium for about 58 years of U.S. use , and less than this ( perhaps 80 % of the time ) at world use rates , although factors in saving and processing impact effective reserve numbers .
