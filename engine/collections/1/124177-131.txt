The operation was a tactical success for the French . However , Giáp , seeing the weakness of the French position , started moving most of his forces from the De Lattre line to Điện Biên Phủ . By mid-December , most of the French and Tai patrols in the hills around the town were wiped out by Viet Minh ambushes . The fight for control of this position would be the longest and hardest battle for the French Far East Expeditionary Corps and would be remembered by the veterans as `` 57 Days of Hell '' .
