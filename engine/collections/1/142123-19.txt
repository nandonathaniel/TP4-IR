A debriefing is normally done within 72 hours of the incident and gives the individual or group the opportunity to talk about their experience , how it has affected them , brainstorm coping mechanisms , identify individuals at risk , and inform the individual or group about services available to them in their community . The final step is to follow up with them the day after the debriefing to ensure that they are safe and coping well or to refer the individual for professional counselling .
