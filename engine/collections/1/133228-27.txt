In 2011 , a proposal surfaced to build a multi-purpose 19,500 - seat arena in Markham , Ontario , northeast of Toronto , that could be used for an NHL team . The C $ 300 million arena is part of a proposed entertainment complex . The company behind the proposal , GTA Sports and Entertainment , is headed by W. Graeme Roustan . Roustan , a Montreal - raised private equity investor whose firm Roustan Capital , partnered with Kohlberg & Company and purchased Bauer from Nike , was also the chairman of Bauer . The proposed location for the arena is near the Unionville commuter train station on land owned by Rudy Bratty , chairman and CEO of Remington Group , an organization that is charged with the development of Markham 's downtown . However , the GTA Sports and Entertainment Group did not file an application for expansion prior to the July 20 , 2015 deadline .
