A manifest affiliation with noir traditions -- which , by its nature , allows different sorts of commentary on them to be inferred -- can also provide the basis for explicit critiques of those traditions . In 1973 , director Robert Altman flipped off noir piety with The Long Goodbye . Based on the novel by Raymond Chandler , it features one of Bogart 's most famous characters , but in iconoclastic fashion : Philip Marlowe , the prototypical hardboiled detective , is replayed as a hapless misfit , almost laughably out of touch with contemporary mores and morality . Where Altman 's subversion of the film noir mythos was so irreverent as to outrage some contemporary critics , around the same time Woody Allen was paying affectionate , at points idolatrous homage to the classic mode with Play It Again , Sam ( 1972 ) . The `` blaxploitation '' film Shaft ( 1971 ) , wherein Richard Roundtree plays the titular African - American private eye , John Shaft , takes conventions from classic noir .
