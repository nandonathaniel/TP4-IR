Rummage Theatre researched , wrote and directed an hour long play called Behind the Wallpaper ( first performed at The Bay Theatre in 2014 ) . The play was inspired by `` The Yellow Wallpaper , '' but focuses on exploring postnatal depression and postpartum psychosis in the present day and uses shadow work cast behind wallpaper to represent the `` Shadow Woman '' which new mother Julie sees as part of her psychosis . The play toured Dorset in 2014 / 2015 .
