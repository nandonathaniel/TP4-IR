At Jamestown , a warning by an Indian boy named Chanco to his employer , Richard Pace , helped reduce total deaths . Pace secured his plantation , and rowed across the river during the night to alert Jamestown , which allowed colonists some defensive preparation . They had no time to warn outposts , which suffered deaths and captives at almost every location . Several entire communities were essentially wiped out , including Henricus and Wolstenholme Towne at Martin 's Hundred . At the Falling Creek Ironworks , which had been seen as promising for the Colony , two women and three children were among the 27 killed , leaving only two colonists alive . The facilities were destroyed .
