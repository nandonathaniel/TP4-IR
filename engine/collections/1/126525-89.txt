When Saturday Night Fever premiered on HBO in 1980 , they aired both versions of the film : the PG version during the day , and the R version during the evening ( HBO had a programming rule of only showing R - rated films during the evening . This was before switching to a 24 - hour - a-day operation , while still under their old broadcast standards concerning R - rated films ) . The premiere of the R - rated edition occurred at midnight on January 1 , 1980 .
