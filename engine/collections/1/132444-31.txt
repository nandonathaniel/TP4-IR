According to Encyclop√¶dia Britannica , poaching was performed by impoverished peasants for subsistence purposes and a supplement for meager diets . Poaching was as well set against the hunting privileges of nobility and territorial rulers . By contrast , stealing domestic animals ( as in cattle raiding , for example ) classifies as theft , not as poaching .
