The year 1737 saw the death of Walpole 's close friend Queen Caroline . Though her death did not end his personal influence with George II , who had grown loyal to the Prime Minister during the preceding years , Walpole 's domination of government continued to decline . His opponents acquired a vocal leader in the Prince of Wales who was estranged from his father , the King . Several young politicians including William Pitt the Elder and George Grenville formed a faction known as the `` Patriot Boys '' and joined the Prince of Wales in opposition .
