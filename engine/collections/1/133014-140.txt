It was well known in ancient Greece that all the Spartans who had been sent to Thermopylae had been killed there ( with the exception of Aristodemus and Pantites ) , and the epitaph exploits the conceit that there was nobody left to bring the news of their deeds back to Sparta . Greek epitaphs often appealed to the passing reader ( always called ' stranger ' ) for sympathy , but the epitaph for the dead Spartans at Thermopylae took this convention much further than usual , asking the reader to make a personal journey to Sparta to break the news that the Spartan expeditionary force had been wiped out . The stranger is also asked to stress that the Spartans died ' fulfilling their orders ' .
