For example , the H key in the QWERTY layout individually yields は , but with the 変換 ( R Thumb Shift ) key , yields み . Simultaneous input with 無 変換 ( L Thumb Shift ) yields ば , which is the individually mapped letter with the aforementioned dakuten . While the pinky - operated Shift key is pressed , the same key yields ぱ . ( This same letter must be typed with 無 変換 ( L Thumb Shift ) + Y on the NICOLA variant . )
