Travelling across the rooftops of the city , the cats meet O'Malley's friend Scat Cat and his musicians , who perform the song Ev'rybody Wants to Be a Cat . After the band has departed , O'Malley and Duchess converse on a nearby rooftop while the kittens listen at a windowsill . Here , Duchess ' loyalty to Madame prompts her to decline O'Malley's proposal of marriage . Duchess and the kittens return to Madame 's mansion , but Edgar places them in a sack and prepares to ship them to Timbuktu ; whereupon they direct Roquefort to retrieve O'Malley . He does so , and O'Malley returns to the mansion , instructing Roquefort to locate Scat Cat and his gang . This done , the alley cats and Frou - Frou fight Edgar , while Roquefort frees Duchess and the kittens . At the end of the fight , Edgar is locked in his own packing - case and sent to Timbuktu himself . Madame Adelaide 's will is rewritten to exclude Edgar , with Madame remaining ignorant of the reason for Edgar 's departure . After adopting O'Malley into the family , Madame establishes a charity foundation housing Paris ' stray cats ( represented by Scat Cat and his band , who reprise their song ) .
