Traditionally , Seventh - day Adventists hold that the Ten Commandments ( including the fourth commandment concerning the sabbath ) are part of the moral law of God , not abrogated by the teachings of Jesus Christ , which apply equally to Christians . This was a common Christian understanding before the Sabbatarian controversy led Sunday - keepers to adopt a more radical antinomian position . Adventists have traditionally distinguished between `` moral law '' and `` ceremonial law '' , arguing that moral law continues to bind Christians , while events predicted by the ceremonial law were fulfilled by Christ 's death on the cross .
