This is entirely without references , but `` decilitre '' is used very commonly in Hungary ( e.g a small glass of beer will be 3 dL ) . In the UK centi - seems to be going out and for most measures of flat pack furniture etc it is done to the millimetre , which is a bit of overprecision , so a kitchen cabinet will be 600 mm rather than 60 cm wide . Hecto , I have never heard in the UK , in particular a hectare nobody says , instead acre which is about 2.5 x 2.5 a hectare . It probably varies from country to country .
