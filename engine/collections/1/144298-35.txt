Modern microwave ovens use either an analog dial - type timer or a digital control panel for operation . Control panels feature an LED , liquid crystal or vacuum fluorescent display , in the 90s brands such as Panasonic and GE began offering models with a scrolling - text display showing cooking instructions , numeric buttons for entering the cook time , a power level selection feature and other possible functions such as a defrost setting and pre-programmed settings for different food types , such as meat , fish , poultry , vegetables , frozen vegetables , frozen dinners , and popcorn . In most ovens , the magnetron is driven by a linear transformer which can only feasibly be switched completely on or off . As such , the choice of power level does not affect the intensity of the microwave radiation ; instead , the magnetron is cycled on and off every few seconds , thus altering the large scale duty cycle . Newer models have inverter power supplies that use pulse - width modulation to provide effectively continuous heating at reduced power , so that foods are heated more evenly at a given power level and can be heated more quickly without being damaged by uneven heating .
