In 1939 , Walt Disney first obtained the film rights to T.H. White 's The Sword in the Stone , and the initial storyboards were produced in 1949 . When work on One Hundred and One Dalmatians was completed in 1960 , two projects were in development , which were Chanticleer and The Sword in the Stone . The former was developed by Ken Anderson and Marc Davis who aimed to produce a feature animated film in a more contemporary setting . Both of them had visited the Disney archives , and decided to adapt the satirical tale into production upon glancing at earlier conceptions dating back to the 1940s . Anderson , Davis , Milt Kahl , and director Wolfgang Reitherman spent months preparing elaborate storyboards for Chanticleer , and following a silent response following a story reel presentation , a voice from the back of the room said , `` You ca n't make a personality out of a chicken ! '' The voice belonged to Bill Peet . When the time came to approve one of the two projects , Walt remarked that the problem with making a rooster a protagonist was that `` ( you ) do n't feel like picking up a rooster up and petting it . '' Meanwhile , work on The Sword in the Stone were solely done by veteran story artist Bill Peet . After Disney had seen the 1960 Broadway production of Camelot , he approved the project to enter production . Ollie Johnston stated , `` ( Kahl ) got furious with Bill for not pushing Chanticleer after all the work he had put in on it . He said , ' I can draw a damn fine rooster , you know . ' Bill said , ' So can I . ' '' Peet recalled `` how humiliated they were to accept defeat and give in to The Sword in the Stone ... He allowed to have their own way , and they let him down . They never understood that I was n't trying to compete with them , just trying to do what I wanted to work . I was the midst of all this competition , and with Walt to please , too . ''
