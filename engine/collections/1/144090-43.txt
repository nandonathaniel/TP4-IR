A revised , retconned origin establishes her as being raised from very early childhood by the U.S.S.R. 's `` Black Widow Ops '' program , rather than solely by Ivan Petrovitch . Petrovitch had taken her to Department X , with other young female orphans , where she was brainwashed , and trained in combat and espionage at the covert `` Red Room '' facility . There , she is biotechnologically and psycho - technologically enhanced -- an accounting that provides a rationale for her unusually long and youthful lifespan . During that time she had some training under Winter Soldier , and the pair even had a short romance . Each Black Widow is deployed with false memories to help ensure her loyalty . Romanova eventually discovers this , including the fact that she had never , as she had believed , been a ballerina . She further discovers that the Red Room is still active as `` 2R '' .
