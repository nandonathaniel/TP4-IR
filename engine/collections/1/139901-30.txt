MTV and the Catfish film 's producers , Schulman and Joseph , help people who are emotionally entangled with someone they have never met in real life . Each episode is an investigation into whether or not the other participant in the virtual relationship is legitimate or if they are , in fact , a `` catfish '' . Some couples have been communicating for a few months -- others , for years .
