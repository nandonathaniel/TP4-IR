Small - scale `` expedition tourism '' has existed since 1957 and is currently subject to Antarctic Treaty and Environmental Protocol provisions , but in effect self - regulated by the International Association of Antarctica Tour Operators ( IAATO ) . Not all vessels associated with Antarctic tourism are members of IAATO , but IAATO members account for 95 % of the tourist activity . Travel is largely by small or medium ship , focusing on specific scenic locations with accessible concentrations of iconic wildlife . A total of 37,506 tourists visited during the 2006 -- 07 Austral summer with nearly all of them coming from commercial ships ; 38,478 were recorded in 2015 -- 16 .
