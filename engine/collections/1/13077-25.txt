Binet and Simon , in creating what historically is known as the Binet - Simon Scale , comprised a variety of tasks they thought were representative of typical children 's abilities at various ages . This task - selection process was based on their many years of observing children in natural settings . They then tested their measurement on a sample of fifty children , ten children per five age groups . The children selected for their study were identified by their school teachers as being average for their age . The purpose of this scale of normal functioning , which would later be revised twice using more stringent standards , was to compare children 's mental abilities relative to those of their normal peers ( Siegler , 1992 ) .
