Roller derby is a team sport played on roller skates on an oval track . Originally a trademarked product developed out of speed skating demonstrations , the sport is currently experiencing a revival as a grass - roots - driven 5 - a-side sport played mainly by women . Most roller derby leagues adopt the rules and guidelines set by the Women 's Flat Track Derby Association or its male counterpart , Men 's Roller Derby Association , but there are leagues that play on a banked track , as the sport was originally from c. 1933 - 1998 .
