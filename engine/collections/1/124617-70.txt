`` The fact that such a prestigious institution could have such a noxious interior fills me with intense remorse mixed with sour distaste . I am sickened by the Administration 's attempts to cover up survivors ' stories , cook their books to discount rapes , pretend that withdrawals never occur , quell attempts at change , and sweep sexual assaults under a rug . When politicians cover up affairs or scandals the masses often rise up in angry protestations and call for a more transparent government . What is the difference between a government and the Amherst College campus ? Why ca n't we know what is really happening on campus ? Why should we be quiet about sexual assault ? ''
