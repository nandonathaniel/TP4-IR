The 19 : 00 to 20 : 00 evening time slot is usually for daily dramas that run from Monday through Friday . Dramas in these slots are in the telenovela format , rarely running over 200 episodes . Unlike the American soap operas , these daily dramas are not also scheduled during the day - time . Instead , the day - time schedule often includes reruns of the flagship dramas . The night - time dailies can achieve very high ratings . For example , the evening series Temptation of Wife peaked at 40.6 % , according to TNS Korea .
