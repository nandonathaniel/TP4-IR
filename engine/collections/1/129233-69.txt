Sacramento 's Chinatown was located on `` I '' Street from Second to Sixth Streets . At the time , this area of `` I '' Street was considered a health hazard because - lying within a levee zone - it was lower than other parts of the city , which were situated on higher land . Throughout Sacramento 's Chinatown history , there were fires , acts of discrimination , and prejudicial legislation such as the Chinese Exclusion Act that was not repealed until 1943 . The mysterious fires were thought to be set off by those who did not take a liking to the Chinese working class . Ordinances on what was viable building material were set into place to try to get the Chinese to move out . Newspapers such as The Sacramento Union wrote stories at the time that portrayed the Chinese in an unfavorable light to inspire ethnic discrimination and drive the Chinese away . As the years passed , a railroad was created over parts of the Chinatown , and further politics and laws would make it even harder for Chinese workers to sustain a living in Sacramento . While the east side of the country fought for higher wages and fewer working hours , many cities in the western United States wanted the Chinese out because of the belief that they were stealing jobs from the white working class .
