Liquid carbon dioxide ( industry nomenclature R744 or R - 744 ) was used as a refrigerant prior to the discovery of R - 12 and may enjoy a renaissance due to the fact that R134a contributes to climate change more than CO does . Its physical properties are highly favorable for cooling , refrigeration , and heating purposes , having a high volumetric cooling capacity . Due to the need to operate at pressures of up to 130 bar ( 1880 psi ) , CO systems require highly resistant components that have already been developed for mass production in many sectors . In automobile air conditioning , in more than 90 % of all driving conditions for latitudes higher than 50 Â° , R744 operates more efficiently than systems using R134a . Its environmental advantages ( GWP of 1 , non-ozone depleting , non-toxic , non-flammable ) could make it the future working fluid to replace current HFCs in cars , supermarkets , and heat pump water heaters , among others . Coca - Cola has fielded CO-based beverage coolers and the U.S. Army is interested in CO refrigeration and heating technology .
