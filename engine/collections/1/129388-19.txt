The 2000 U.S. Presidential election is often cited as an example of the spoiler effect . In that election , Al Gore , the Democratic candidate , received more popular votes than George W. Bush , the Republican candidate , but lost in the electoral college . In the state of Florida , the final certified vote count showed Bush with just 537 more votes than Gore . Because Bush defeated Gore in Florida , he won the state , received more votes in the electoral college , and became president of the United States .
