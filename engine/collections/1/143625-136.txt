In May 2007 , The Daily Telegraph , citing unnamed sources , reported the Queen was `` exasperated and frustrated '' by the policies of the British Prime Minister , Tony Blair , that she was concerned the British Armed Forces were overstretched in Iraq and Afghanistan , and that she had raised concerns over rural and countryside issues with Blair . She was , however , said to admire Blair 's efforts to achieve peace in Northern Ireland . She became the first British monarch to celebrate a diamond wedding anniversary in November 2007 . On 20 March 2008 , at the Church of Ireland St Patrick 's Cathedral , Armagh , the Queen attended the first Maundy service held outside England and Wales .
