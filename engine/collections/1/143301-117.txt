According to The Globe and Mail 's John Barber , Martin manages simultaneously to master and transcend the genre so that `` Critics applaud the depth of his characterizations and lack of clich√© in books that are nonetheless replete with dwarves and dragons '' . Publishers Weekly gave favorable reviews to the first three A Song of Ice and Fire novels at their points of release , saying that A Game of Thrones had `` superbly developed characters , accomplished prose and sheer bloody - mindedness '' , that A Clash of Kings was `` notable particularly for the lived - in quality of ( their fictional world and ) for the comparatively modest role of magic '' , and that A Storm of Swords was one `` of the more rewarding examples of gigantism in contemporary fantasy '' . However , they found that A Feast For Crows as the fourth installment `` sorely misses its other half . The slim pickings here are tasty , but in no way satisfying . '' Their review for A Dance with Dragons repeated points of criticism for the fourth volume , and said that , although `` The new volume has a similar feel to Feast '' , `` Martin keeps it fresh by focusing on popular characters ( who were ) notably absent from the previous book .
