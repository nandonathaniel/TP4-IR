The term a feather in your cap is an English idiomatic phrase believed to have derived from the general custom in some cultures of a warrior adding a new feather to their head - gear for every enemy slain , or in other cases from the custom of establishing the success of a hunter as being the first to bag a game bird by plucking off the feathers of that prey and placing them in the hat band . The phrase today has altered to a more peaceful allusion , where it is used to refer to any laudable success or achievement by an individual that may help that person in the future .
