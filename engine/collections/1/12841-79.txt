On July 23 , 1967 , the first plebiscite on the political status of Puerto Rico was held . Voters overwhelmingly affirmed continuation of Commonwealth status ( with 60.4 % voting to remain a commonwealth , 39 % voting to work towards statehood ) . Other referendums have been subsequently held to determine the political status of Puerto Rico , in 1993 and in 1998 . In all three of these , the status quo has been upheld ; there was no strong feeling in favor of independence or statehood .
