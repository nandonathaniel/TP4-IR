Al - Kindi ( Alkindus ) , a famous logician and prominent figure in the House of Wisdom , is unanimously hailed as the `` father of Islamic or Arabic philosophy '' . His synthesis of Greek philosophy with Islamic beliefs met with much opposition , and at one point he was flogged by those opposed to his ideas . He argued that one could accept the Koran and other sacred texts , and work from that point to determine truth . Whenever he ran into an impasse , he would abandon the Greek ideas in favor of the Islamic faith . He is considered to be largely responsible for pulling the Arab world out of a mystic and theological way of thinking into a more rationalistic mode . Previous to al - Kindi , for example , on the question of how the immaterial God of the Koran could sit on a throne in the same book , one theologist had said , `` The sitting is known , its modality is unknown . Belief in it is a necessity , and raising questions regarding it is a heresy . '' Few of al - Kindi 's writings have survived , making it difficult to judge his work directly , but it is clear from what exists that he carefully worked to present his ideas in a way acceptable to other Muslims .
