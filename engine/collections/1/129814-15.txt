Packets sent to the broadcast address , all one bits , are received by all stations on a local area network . In hexadecimal the broadcast address would be FF : FF : FF : FF : FF : FF . A broadcast frame is flooded and is forwarded to and accepted by all other nodes . Packets sent to a multicast address are received by all stations on a LAN that have been configured to receive packets sent to that address . Functional addresses identify one or more Token Ring NICs that provide a particular service , defined in IEEE 802.5 .
