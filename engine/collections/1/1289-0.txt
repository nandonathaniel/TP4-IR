The olive wreath also known as kotinos ( Greek : κότινος ) , was the prize for the winner at the ancient Olympic Games . It was a branch of the wild olive tree that grew at Olympia , intertwined to form a circle or a horse - shoe . The branches of the sacred wild - olive tree near the temple of Zeus were cut by a `` pais amfithalis '' ( a boy whose parents were both alive ) with a pair of golden scissors . Then he took them to the temple of Hera and placed them on a gold - ivory table . From there , the Hellanodikai ( the judges of the Olympic Games ) would take them , make the wreaths and crown the winners of the Games .
