In the nervous system , Rhazes stated that nerves had motor or sensory functions , describing 7 cranial and 31 spinal cord nerves . He assigned a numerical order to the cranial nerves from the optic to the hypoglossal nerves . He classified the spinal nerves into 8 cervical , 12 thoracic , 5 lumbar , 3 sacral , and 3 coccygeal nerves . He used this to link clinical signs of injury to the corresponding location of lesions in the nervous system .
