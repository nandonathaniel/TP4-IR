Cell junctions are the contact points between plasma membrane and tissue cells . There are mainly 5 different types of cell junctions : tight junctions , adherens junctions , desmosomes , hemidesmosomes , and gap junctions . Tight junctions are a pair of trans - membrane protein fused on outer plasma membrane . Adherens junctions are a plaque ( protein layer on the inside plasma membrane ) which attaches both cells ' microfilaments . Desmosomes attach to the microfilaments of cytoskeleton made up of keratin protein . Hemidesmosomes resemble desmosomes on a section . They are made up of the integrin ( a transmembrane protein ) instead of cadherin . They attach the epithelial cell to the basement membrane . Gap junctions connect the cytoplasm of two cells and are made up of proteins called connexins ( six of which come together to make a connexion ) .
