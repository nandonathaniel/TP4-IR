In mid-2010 after the siege which saw the factory burn down , Nick Tilsley ( Ben Price ) sees an opportunity to use it as temporary factory , but he does so under the name Nick 's Knicks meaning it had nothing to do with Carla Connor ( Alison King ) or Underworld . After the closure of the temporary factory , Nick rents the space again from owner George and re-opens The Joinery in late 2010 , employing ex-kebab shop worker Cheryl Gray ( Holly Quin - Ankrah ) as barmaid and Ciaran McCarthy ( Keith Duffy ) as chef , with ex-wife Leanne as manager to allow her to live her dream . However , Nick and Leanne grow close and embark on an affair . In December Ken Barlow ( William Roache ) walks in on them in the office looking for Peter and is disgusted with Leanne . The Joinery is destroyed following a gas explosion causing the tram to crash onto Coronation Street in front of the bar , which kills Ashley Peacock ( Steven Arnold ) and nearly kills Peter . In 2011 Nick renovates and re-opens it as The Bistro , again employing Cheryl , along with his mother Gail ( Helen Worth ) as cleaner . Becky McDonald ( Katherine Kelly ) briefly works there after her split from husband Steve ( Simon Gregson ) . Believing that his wife Kylie Platt ( Paula Lane ) needed to rest due to her pregnancy , David Platt ( Jack P. Shepherd ) takes over her evening shifts . The Bistro loses two employees in Spring 2014 as Gloria Price ( Sue Johnston ) and Stella Price ( Michelle Collins ) both leave Weatherfield . As Leanne splits with Nick , he renames it Just Nick 's .
