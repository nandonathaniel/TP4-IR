Writing for Movie Music UK , Jonathan Broxton praised Bates ' score as a `` blast '' , describing it as `` like night and day '' compared to Junkie XL 's score for the first film which Broxton felt had `` failed on every conceivable level '' . He specifically called the use of choir `` hilarious and brilliant '' , and the main theme of the score `` outstanding '' , considering it to be better than the thematic work done by many of the other composers who have worked on the X-Men franchise . He concluded that Bates `` fully understood the needs of this film and delivered exactly what was required , but remembered to imbue it with a great deal of personality '' . On the soundtrack , Broxton was positive about the songs chosen for the film , and particularly praised `` Ashes '' as both `` hilarious '' and a genuine contender for the Academy Award for Best Original Song .
