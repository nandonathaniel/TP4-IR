The coup of 1952 led by General Fulgencio Batista , an ally of the United States , against President Carlos Prio , forced Prio into exile to Miami , Florida . Prio 's exile was the reason for the 26th July Movement led by Castro . The movement , which did not succeed until after the Cuban Revolution of 31 December 1958 , severed the country 's formerly strong links with the US after nationalizing American economic assets ( banks , oil refineries , sugar and coffee plantations , along with other American owned businesses ) .
