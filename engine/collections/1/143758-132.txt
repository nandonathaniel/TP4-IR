The disks were Modified Frequency Modulation ( MFM ) coded in 512 - byte sectors , and were soft - sectored . They contained 40 tracks per side at the 48 track per inch ( TPI ) density , and initially were formatted to contain eight sectors per track . This meant that SSDD disks initially had a formatted capacity of 160 kB , while DSDD disks had a capacity of 320 kB . However , the DOS operating system was later updated to allow formatting the disks with nine sectors per track . This yielded a formatted capacity of 180 kB with SSDD disks / drives , and 360 kB with DSDD disks / drives . The unformatted capacity of the floppy disks was advertised as `` 250KB '' for SSDD and `` 500KB '' for DSDD ( `` KB '' ambiguously referring to either 1000 or 1024 bytes ; essentially the same for rounded - off values ) , however these `` raw '' 250 / 500 kB were not the same thing as the usable formatted capacity ; under DOS , the maximum capacity for SSDD and DSDD disks was 180 kB and 360 kB , respectively . Regardless of type , the file system of all floppy disks ( under DOS ) was FAT12 .
