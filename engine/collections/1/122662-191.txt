The M1 motorway runs along the east flank of MK and serves it from junctions 13 , 14 , and 15A . The A5 road runs right through MK as a grade separated dual carriageway . Other main roads are the A509 , linking Milton Keynes with Wellingborough and Kettering , and the A421 and A422 , both running west towards Buckingham and east towards Bedford . Proximity to the M1 has led to construction of a number of distribution centres , including Magna Park at the A421 / A5130 junction .
