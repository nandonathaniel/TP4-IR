Similarly , much of the violence and sexual content is slightly toned down from the original musical . For instance , the death of Jack 's mother is less violent in the film . On stage , the steward clubs her to death with his staff ; in the film , he simply shoves her to the ground and she hits her head on a log . The death of the baker 's wife is not explicitly shown in the film , and the cause of her death is changed from being crushed by a tree in the giant 's wife 's wake to accidentally backing off the edge of a cliff while fleeing from the wife of the giant .
