Following the Civil War -- and in the wake of the Second Industrial Revolution -- Indianapolis experienced tremendous growth and prosperity . In 1880 , Indianapolis was the world 's third largest pork packing city , after Chicago and Cincinnati , and the second largest railroad center in the United States by 1888 . By 1890 , the city 's population surpassed 100,000 . Some of the city 's most notable businesses were founded during this period of growth and innovation , including L.S. Ayres ( 1872 ) , Eli Lilly and Company ( 1876 ) , Madame C.J. Walker Manufacturing Company ( 1910 ) , and Allison Transmission ( 1915 ) . Once home to 60 automakers , Indianapolis rivaled Detroit as a center of automobile manufacturing . The city was an early focus of labor organization . The Indianapolis Street Car Strike of 1913 and subsequent police mutiny and riots led to the creation of the state 's earliest labor - protection laws , including a minimum wage , regular work weeks , and improved working conditions . The International Typographical Union and United Mine Workers of America were among several influential labor unions to be based in the city .
