Samples from `` Suzanne '' have also been used : Robert McKay used lines from Cohen 's poem as chapter titles in his 1969 young adult novel Dave 's Song . Verses of the song are played intermittently throughout the 1974 movie The Second Coming of Suzanne , starring Sondra Locke , Paul Sand , Jared Martin and Richard Dreyfuss . Rapper Plan B sampled the song for his Paint It Blacker mixtape , detailing a fictionalised account of a prostitute killed by the Camden Ripper and dumped in the river . The band R.E.M. gave Cohen a joint songwriting credit for their song `` Hope '' ( on their 1998 album Up ) , in light of the similarity between the two songs . R.E.M. describe themselves as realising that similarity only after completing the song .
