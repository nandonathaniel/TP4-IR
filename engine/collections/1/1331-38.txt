Assassin 's Creed IV : Black Flag is an action - adventure , stealth game set in an open world environment and played from a third - person perspective . The game features three main cities ; Havana , Kingston , and Nassau , which reside under Spanish , British , and pirate influence , respectively . It also features 50 other individual locations to explore , including atolls , sea forts , Mayan ruins , sugar plantations , and underwater shipwrecks , with a 60 / 40 balance between land and naval exploration . It has a more open world feel , with missions similar to those found in Assassin 's Creed , as well as fewer restrictions for the player . The world opens up sooner in the game , as opposed to Assassin 's Creed III , which had very scripted missions and did not give players freedom to explore until the game was well into its first act . The player will encounter jungles , forts , ruins , and small villages and the world is built to allow players much more freedom , such as allowing players to engage , board , and capture passing ships and swimming to nearby beaches in a seamless fashion . In addition , the hunting system has been retained from Assassin 's Creed III , allowing the player to hunt on land , and fish in the water , with resources gathered used to upgrade equipment .
