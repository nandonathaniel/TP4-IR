Federal law forbade such a strike , and the Transportation department implemented a backup plan ( of supervisors and military air controllers ) to keep the system running . The strikers were given 48 hours to return to work , else they would be fired and banned from ever again working in a federal capacity . A fourth of the strikers came back to work , but 13,000 did not . The strike collapsed , PATCO vanished , and the union movement as a whole suffered a major reversal , which accelerated the decline of membership across the board in the private sector .
