The current Polynesian name of the island , Rapa Nui ( `` Big Rapa '' ) , was coined after the slave raids of the early 1860s , and refers to the island 's topographic resemblance to the island of Rapa in the Bass Islands of the Austral Islands group . However , Norwegian ethnographer Thor Heyerdahl argued that Rapa was the original name of Easter Island and that Rapa Iti was named by refugees from there .
