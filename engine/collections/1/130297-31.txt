There are many thematically significant literary allusions in The History of Love . The writer Isaac Babel ( 1894 -- 1940 ) , as eulogized by Leo Gursky , has unmistakable affinities with Zvi Litvinoff 's description of Leo 's own writing style , and the description of Rosa Litvinoff 's writing style in the early chapter `` Forgive Me '' . The Polish writer Bruno Schulz ( 1892 -- 1942 ) and his classic The Street of Crocodiles are mentioned several times in the novel , as is Nicanor Parra ( 1914 -- ) , whose 1954 book of antipoems is translated by Charlotte Singer and read by the mysterious Jacob Marcus . A passing reference to `` Don Quixote '' by Miguel de Cervantes ( 1547 -- 1616 ) is also significant because Don Quixote is a novel that contains stand - alone stories within it , much in the same way that The History of Love contains excerpts of a mysterious book called `` The History of Love . '' Other important literary allusions in the novel include references to James Joyce , Franz Kafka , Antoine de Saint Exupéry , Leo Tolstoy , Rubén Darío and Pablo Neruda . Although he is never directly mentioned , the novel also alludes to Isaac Bashevis Singer in that Leo 's son 's name is Isaac and Alma 's last name is Singer .
