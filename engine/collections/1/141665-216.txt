The split in the Democratic party is sometimes held responsible for Lincoln 's victory , , however , despite the fact that Lincoln won the election with less than forty percent of the popular vote , much of the anti-Republican vote was `` wasted '' in Southern states where Lincoln was not even on the ballot . At most , a single opponent nationwide would only have deprived Lincoln of California , Oregon , and four New Jersey electors , whose combined total of eleven electoral votes would have made no difference to the result ; every other state won by the Republicans was won by a clear majority of the vote . In the three states of New York , Rhode Island , and New Jersey where anti-Lincoln votes did combine into fusion tickets , Lincoln still won two and split New Jersey . If the opposition had formed fusion tickets in every state , Lincoln still would have received 169 electoral votes , 17 more than the 152 required to win the Electoral College .
