Reducing the `` rotating mass '' , which comprises the crankshaft , connecting rods , pistons , and flywheel . Doing so can improve throttle response due to lower rotational inertia , as well as reduce the automobile 's overall weight . This may be achieved by using alloy parts instead of steel . However , a heavy crankshaft can void the need for a flywheel ( which is common on V6 engines ) .
