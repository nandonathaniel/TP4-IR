The Wanderers were established in 1903 , and had garnered success in several hockey leagues ( including the National Hockey Association ) before joining the NHL in 1917 . The Wanderers played the first overall game in NHL history against the Arenas . Dave Ritchie of the Wanderers scored the first goal in NHL history one minute into its first game . Then , his teammate Harry Hyland became the first NHL player to score five goals in one game . Another tally by Ritchie in the third period helped the Wanderers to a 10 -- 9 win over the Torontos . On this same day , the Montreal Canadiens played the Ottawa Senators . In this game , Joe Malone would then match Hyland 's feat , becoming the second player in NHL history to score five goals in a game in their 7 -- 4 win over the Senators .
