The upper Congo basin runs west of the Albertine Rift . Its connection to the Congo was unknown until 1877 . The extreme northeast of the Congo basin was reached by the Nilotic expansion at some point between the 15th and 18th centuries , by the ancestors of the Southern Luo speaking Alur people . Francisco de Lacerda following the Zambezi reached the uppermost part of the Congo basin ( the Kazembe in the upper Luapula basin ) in 1796 .
