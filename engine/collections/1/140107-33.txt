Smut feeds on the corn plant and decreases the yield . Smut - infected crops are often destroyed , although some farmers use them to prepare silage . In Mexico , however , smut is highly esteemed as a delicacy , where it is known as huitlacoche , being preserved and sold for a significantly higher price than uninfected corn . The consumption of corn smut originated directly from Aztec cuisine . For culinary use , the galls are harvested while still immature -- fully mature galls are dry and almost entirely spore - filled . The immature galls , gathered two to three weeks after an ear of corn is infected , still retain moisture and , when cooked , have a flavor described as mushroom - like , sweet , savory , woody , and earthy . Flavor compounds include sotolon and vanillin , as well as the sugar glucose .
