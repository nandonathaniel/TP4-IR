The original narrative of Bundle of Joy was produced by Joe Pasternak who had developed a winning formula in Universal Picture 's Berlin division . His second picture with Henry Koster ( director ) , Felix Jackson ( writer ) , and Franciska Gaal ( actress ) was Kleine Mutti ( Little Mother , 1935 ) about the orphan Marie who raises a foundling and ends up marrying a banker . The German - language film was remade in English as Bachelor Mother three years later . Bundle of Joy is a musical adaptation of Bachelor Mother , and Jackson retains story credit on both pictures .
