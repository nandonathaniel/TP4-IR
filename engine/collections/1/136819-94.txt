Composer Jeff Russo wrote several themes for the series , in addition to the main title theme , but not necessarily for the different characters in the show as would often be done . Instead , Russo wanted to focus on the emotions of the characters over the story beats , for instance `` even when you are shooting , you 're still feeling , so why not play that as opposed to ' Oh my god , he 's got a gun , ' or ' Oh my god he 's got a phaser . ' '' Like the rest of the series ' departments , Russo 's aim was to make the score feel cinematic as well .
