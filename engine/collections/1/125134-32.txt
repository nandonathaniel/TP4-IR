An ogbanje is a reincarnating evil spirit that would deliberately plague a family with misfortune . In folklore , the ogbanje upon being born by the mother , under a certain amount of time ( usually before puberty ) , would deliberately die and then come back and repeat the cycle , causing the family grief . This time period varies between minutes , hours , days and years . Female circumcision was sometimes thought to get rid of the evil spirit , whereas finding the evil spirits Iyi - uwa , which they have dug somewhere secret , would ensure the ogbanje would never plague the family with misfortune again . The Iyi - uwa is a stone that the ogbanje 's way of coming back to the world and also a way of finding its targeted family . The stone is deep enough to not have been planted physically by a child . The iyi - uwa is dug out by a priest and destroyed . Furthermore , female ogbanje die during pregnancies along with the baby , male ogbanje die before the birth of a wife 's baby or the baby dies . The child is confirmed to no longer be an ogbanje after the destruction of the stone or after they successfully give birth to another baby .
