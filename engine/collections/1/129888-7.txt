In general use , the word `` apocrypha '' came to mean `` false , spurious , bad , or heretical . '' This meaning also appears in Origen 's prologue to his commentary on the Song of Songs , of which only the Latin translation survives : De scripturis his , quae appellantur apocryphae , pro eo quod multa in iis corrupta et contra fidem veram inveniuntur a majoribus tradita non placuit iis dari locum nec admitti ad auctoritatem . `` Concerning these scriptures , which are called apocryphal , for the reason that many things are found in them corrupt and against the true faith handed down by the elders , it has pleased them that they not be given a place nor be admitted to authority .
