Emmanuel L. Osorio , one of the founders of the Ninth Ray movement , came up with a proposal adding not only a ninth ray to the flag 's sun but also adding a fourth star to the flag representing North Borneo ( present - day Sabah ) , a territory claimed by the Philippines but currently under Malaysian sovereignty . The flag 's triangle is changed into a rectangle to accommodate a fourth star . According to Osorio , the star representing Sabah in his proposed flag was added `` in principle '' and said the flag proposal seeks to express the Ninth Ray movement 's view that `` if we get Sabah , then it could be represented by the star '' .
