There is a report that Ives also won the admiration of Gustav Mahler , who said that he was a true musical revolutionary . Reportedly , Mahler talked of premiering Ives ' Third Symphony with the New York Philharmonic , but he soon died ( in 1911 ) thus preventing the premiere . However , the source of this story is Ives himself ; since Mahler died , there was no way to verify whether he had seen the score of the symphony or decided to perform it in the 1911 -- 12 season . Nonetheless , it is known that Ives regularly attended New York Philharmonic concerts and probably heard Mahler conduct the Philharmonic at Carnegie Hall .
