The series follows a ritualistic pattern and centers around an assortment and musical pop group of neighboring playmates depicted as bipedal , anthropomorphic animals : Uniqua , Pablo , Tyrone , Austin , and Tasha . Designed to encourage imaginative play , the characters communicate with the viewers by constantly breaking the fourth - wall , albeit the series rests particular focus on the role - playing games in which the friends participate varying with each episode , and said games are visualized through dream sequences lasting for a majority of the episode and serving as the primary focus of that certain episode . Usually , the group will visualize a unique scenario , ranging from prehistoric times to adventurous fantasies , and they are often presented with multiple dilemmas along the way to accomplishing a certain goal or priority , or may be challenged with a major single obstacle to defeat or problem to solve . After season one , there is usually a villain in the episode , mainly played by one of the Backyardigans ( thus another Backyardigan plays the role of the hero ) , but the villain of the episode always reforms in the end . The program also follows a musical format , featuring multiple musical numbers sung throughout the course of an episode regarding whatever imaginary predicament in which the characters have situated themselves or perhaps a challenge that they have met , every episode opening and concluding with a particular song . The adventures get more advanced after the first season . When the Backyardigans have achieved their mission or defeated any disadvantages , the fantasy sequence fades , restoring actuality to the setting of the episodes as the closing song is sung , the characters scurrying to their houses for a snack . The main character or characters then opens the snack host 's house door , fence , or around the corner , and shouts the main catchphrase for the final time and then closes the door . The picture then is lifeless with some background bird noises often heard as iris closes , ending the episode .
