The Medici became leaders of Christendom through their two famous 16th century popes , Leo X and Clement VII . Both also served as de facto political rulers of Rome , Florence , and large swaths of Italy known as the Papal States . They were generous patrons of the arts who commissioned masterpieces such as Raphael 's Transfiguration and Michelangelo 's The Last Judgment ; however , their reigns coincided with troubles for the Vatican , including Martin Luther 's Protestant Reformation and the infamous sack of Rome in 1527 .
