On the other hand , evidence of an oral agreement is not admissible if its terms are inconsistent with those of the written agreement -- as , for example , where the acceptor of a bill of exchange alleges that the payee had orally agreed with him that he would be liable for the full amount of the bill . Similarly , where a deed of sale of land sets out the purchase price and also states that the land is sold without encumbrances , evidence is not admissible of a prior or contemporaneous oral agreement that the price was fixed at some other figure , or that the land was sold subject to a servitude .
