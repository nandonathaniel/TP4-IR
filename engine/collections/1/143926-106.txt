In a 2014 study , researchers at Cornell University reported that political correctness , by which they meant norms discouraging the use of sexist language and behaviour , increased creativity in mixed - sex work teams . This seemed to be because without the norms there was no common expectation about appropriate behavior . This meant men feared being perceived as sexist ( thus potentially suffering social sanction ) while women feared being perceived as incompetent and having their ideas under - valued , creating uncertainty for both sexes about how to interact . In same - sex teams , however , PC norms harmed productivity , possibly because they provided an irrelevant distraction to the task . In addition , the tasks assigned in the study were very typical and the researchers noted that political correctness may not be very useful when dealing with politically charged topics surrounding sex differences or issues relating to diversity , discrimination and equality , a possible limitation to the study . The researchers concluded that their findings indicated that political correctness could be useful in enhancing productivity in some circumstances .
