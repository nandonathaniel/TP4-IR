René Lévesque , architect of the first referendum on sovereignty , claimed a willingness to work for change in the Canadian framework after the federalist victory in the referendum of 1980 . This approach was dubbed le beau risque ( `` the beautiful risk '' ) , and it led to many ministers of the Lévesque 's government to resign in protest . The 1982 patriation of the Canadian constitution did not solve the issue in the point of view of the majority of sovereignists . The constitutional amendment of 1982 was agreed to by representatives from 9 of the 10 provinces ( with René Lévesque abstaining ) . Nonetheless , the constitution is integral to the political and legal systems used in Quebec .
