In clinical psychological practice in the United States , duty to warn requires a clinician who has reasonable grounds to believe that a client may be in imminent danger of harming himself or others to warn the possible victims . Duty to warn is among the few exceptions to a client 's right to confidentiality and the therapist 's ethical obligation to maintain confidential information related in the context of the therapeutic relationship . In the American Psychological Association 's Ethical Principles of Psychologists and Code of Conduct , the therapist 's duty to warn is implicitly contained within the guidelines for disclosure of confidential information without the consent of the client : `` Psychologists disclose confidential information without the consent of the individual only as mandated by law , or where permitted by law for a valid purpose such as to ... protect the client / patient , psychologist , or others from harm . '' In situations when there is cause for serious concern about a client harming someone , the clinician must breach confidentiality to warn the identified victim / third party about imminent danger . Although laws vary somewhat in different states , in general , the danger must be imminent and the breach of confidentiality should be made to someone who is in a position to reduce the risk of the danger . People who would be appropriate recipients of such information would include the intended victim and the law enforcement .
