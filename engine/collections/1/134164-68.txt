Nero became emperor in AD 54 at sixteen , the youngest emperor yet . Like his uncle Caligula before him , Nero was also a direct descendant of Augustus Caesar , a fact which made his ascension to the throne much easier and smoother than it had been for Tiberius or Claudius . Ancient historians describe Nero 's early reign as being strongly influenced by his mother Agrippina , his tutor Seneca , and the Praetorian Prefect Burrus , especially in the first year . He was made Emperor over his step - brother , Claudius ' son Britannicus , who he had killed . Agrippina was believed to have poisoned Claudius , having allegedly poisoned her second husband Gaius Sallustius Crispus Passienus . She had also arranged the deaths of Caligula 's third wife , Lollia Paulina and Messalina 's mother Domitia Lepida the Younger . She saw that the dynasty 's numbers dwindle with the execution of Marcus Junius Silanus Torquatus , a grandson of Julia the Younger , to strengthen Nero 's claim , having previously arranged the death of his brother Lucius Junius Silanus Torquatus . In AD 55 , Nero began taking on a more active role as an administrator . He was consul four times between AD 55 and 60 . Nero consolidated power over time through the execution and banishment of his rivals and slowly usurped authority from the Senate . He reportedly arranged the death of his own mother Agrippina and after divorcing his wife Claudia Octavia , daughter of Claudius ' and Messalina , he had her killed . Other relatives whom Nero was believed to have had killed were Claudius ' daughter by Aelia Paetina , Claudia Antonia , her husband and half - brother of Messalina , Faustus Cornelius Sulla Felix , Decimus Junius Silanus Torquatus , brother of Marcus and Lucius Junius Silanus Torquantus , as well as Marcus ' son , also named Lucius , his aunt Domitia Lepida the Elder , and Rubellius Plautus , son of Julia Livia along with his wife , children and father - in - law .
