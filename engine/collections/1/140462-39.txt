Half dimes continued to be struck , at both the Philadelphia and the San Francisco Mint , until the series was ended by the Coinage Act of 1873 . Despite the abolition , the silver pieces continued to circulate in the West , where silver or gold coins were preferred , throughout the remainder of the 19th century . Improved economic conditions , combined with low silver prices , brought large quantities of hoarded silver coinage , including half dimes , into circulation beginning in April 1876 . In late 1876 , production of the Shield nickel was halted . No Shield nickels were struck in 1877 or 1878 , excepting proof specimens for collectors . As the Treasury had a large stock of nickels in storage , only small numbers were struck over the next few years ; full - scale production did not resume until December 1881 .
