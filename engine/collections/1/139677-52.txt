Napoleon III took advantage of the war in 1863 , when he installed Austrian archduke Maximilian of Habsburg on the throne in Mexico . The United States protested and refused to recognize the new government . Napoleon hoped that that a Confederate victory would result in two weak nations on Mexico 's northern borders , allowing French dominance in a country ruled by its puppet Emperor Maximilian . Matías Romero , Júarez 's ambassador to the United States , gained some support in Congress for possibly intervening on Mexico 's behalf against France 's occupation . However , Secretary of State William Seward was cautious in limiting US aid to Mexico . He did not want a war with France before the Confederacy was defeated .
