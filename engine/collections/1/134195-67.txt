The Roman Missal as revised in 1970 simplifies this , saying : `` The Gloria is intoned by the priest or , if appropriate , by a cantor or by the choir ; but it is sung either by everyone together , or by the people alternately with the choir , or by the choir alone . If not sung , it is to be recited either by all together or by two parts of the congregation responding one to the other . '' No particular ritual gestures are prescribed .
