The Lineweaver -- Burk plot was widely used to determine important terms in enzyme kinetics , such as K and V , before the wide availability of powerful computers and non-linear regression software . The y - intercept of such a graph is equivalent to the inverse of V ; the x-intercept of the graph represents âˆ’ 1 / K. It also gives a quick , visual impression of the different forms of enzyme inhibition .
