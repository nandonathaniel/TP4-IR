Classical Antiquity in Greece was preceded by the Greek Dark Ages ( c. 1200 -- c. 800 BC ) , archaeologically characterised by the protogeometric and geometric styles of designs on pottery . Following the Dark Ages was the Archaic Period , beginning around the 8th century BC . The Archaic Period saw early developments in Greek culture and society which formed the basis for the Classical Period . After the Archaic Period , the Classical Period in Greece is conventionally considered to have lasted from the Persian invasion of Greece in 480 until the death of Alexander the Great in 323 . The period is characterized by a style which was considered by later observers to be exemplary , i.e. , `` classical '' , as shown in the Parthenon , for instance . Politically , the Classical Period was dominated by Athens and the Delian League during the 5th century , but displaced by Spartan hegemony during the early 4th century BC , before power shifted to Thebes and the Boeotian League and finally to the League of Corinth led by Macedon . This period saw the Greco - Persian Wars and the Rise of Macedon .
