English director Neil Marshall was aware of Game of Thrones from trailers and , given his experience with action and horror films , had unsuccessfully sought a directing role . About a week before shooting was to start , the episode 's planned director had to leave the production because of a personal emergency , and a replacement had to be found quickly . Benioff and Weiss settled on Marshall on the basis of his work on Centurion and Dog Soldiers , where he created intensive action sequences on a limited budget . Marshall began filming after two weeks of preparation , which included watching the show 's first season . He avoided watching the Battle of Helm 's Deep in The Lord of the Rings : The Two Towers as it was , according to Marshall , `` an obvious comparison . '' He did , however , study such films as The Vikings and Kingdom of Heaven .
