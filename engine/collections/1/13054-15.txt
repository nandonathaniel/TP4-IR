A special standard of care also applies to children , who , in a majority of jurisdictions , are held to the behavior that is reasonable for a child of similar age , experience , and intelligence under like circumstances . ( Restatement ( Second ) of Torts ยง 283A ; Cleveland Rolling - Mill Co. v. Corrigan , 46 Ohio St. 283 , 20 N.E. 466 ( 1889 ) . ) In some cases it means that more may be required of a child of superior intelligence . ( Compare Jones v. Fireman 's Insurance Co. of Newark , New Jersey , 240 So. 2d 780 ( La. App . 1970 ) with Robinson v. Travis , 393 So. 2d 304 ( La. App . 1980 ) . An exception is for children engaged in `` adult activity . '' Dellwo v. Pearson , 107 N.W. 2d 859 ( Minn 1961 ) Nicholsen v. Brown , 232 Or . 426 , 374 P. 2d 896 ( 1962 ) ( automobile ) ; Daniels v. Evans , 102 N.H. 407 , 224 A. 2d 63 ( 1966 ) ( motor scooter ) ; Neumann . v. Shlansky , 58 Misc . 2d 128 , 294 N.Y.S. 2d 628 ( 1968 ( playing golf ) ) What constitutes an `` adult standard '' may depend on local statute , and some have arbitrary age distinctions . Another exception is if the child is engaged in an `` inherently dangerous activity . '' It is up to the trier of fact to decide if the activity is inherently dangerous . If they find that it is , the child must be held to an adult standard of care . Robinson v. Lindsay , 92 Wash. 2d 410 , 598 P. 2d 2392 ( 1979 ) ( snowmobile ) ;
