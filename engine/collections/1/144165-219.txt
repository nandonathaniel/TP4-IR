In this belief , the soul is created in the image of God . Since God is Trinitarian , Mankind is Nous , reason , both logos and dianoia , and Spirit . The same is held true of the soul ( or heart ) : it has nous , word and spirit . To understand this better first an understanding of Saint Gregory Palamas 's teaching that man is a representation of the trinitarian mystery should be addressed . This holds that God is not meant in the sense that the Trinity should be understood anthropomorphically , but man is to be understood in a triune way . Or , that the Trinitarian God is not to be interpreted from the point of view of individual man , but man is interpreted on the basis of the Trinitarian God . And this interpretation is revelatory not merely psychological and human . This means that it is only when a person is within the revelation , as all the saints lived , that he can grasp this understanding completely ( see theoria ) . The second presupposition is that mankind has and is composed of nous , word and spirit like the trinitarian mode of being . Man 's nous , word and spirit are not hypostases or individual existences or realities , but activities or energies of the soul - whereas in the case with God or the Persons of the Holy Trinity , each are indeed hypostases . So these three components of each individual man are ' inseparable from one another ' but they do not have a personal character '' when in speaking of the being or ontology that is mankind . The nous as the eye of the soul , which some Fathers also call the heart , is the center of man and is where true ( spiritual ) knowledge is validated . This is seen as true knowledge which is `` implanted in the nous as always co-existing with it '' .
