Closely related to the Second Great Awakening were other reform movements such as temperance , abolition , and women 's rights . The temperance movement encouraged people to abstain from consuming alcoholic drinks in order to preserve family order . The abolition movement fought to abolish slavery in the United States . The women 's rights movement grew from female abolitionists who realized that they too could fight for their own political rights . In addition to these causes , reforms touched nearly every aspect of daily life , such as restricting the use of tobacco and dietary and dress reforms . The abolition movement emerged in the North from the wider Second Great Awakening 1800 -- 1840 .
