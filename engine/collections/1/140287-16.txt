After portraying a priest opposite Julianne Moore and Ralph Fiennes in Neil Jordan 's acclaimed adaptation of Graham Greene 's The End of the Affair ( 1999 ) , Isaacs played the charismatic honourable priest opposite Kirstie Alley in the miniseries The Last Don . He then shone as `` memorable '' villain , Colonel William Tavington , in Roland Emmerich 's American Revolutionary War fictional film epic The Patriot ( 2000 ) . Starring opposite Mel Gibson as the film 's hero , and Heath Ledger as Gibson 's screen son , Isaacs portrays a sadistic British Army officer who kills Ledger 's character , among many other soldiers . Although his work in the film earned him comparisons to Ralph Fiennes ' portrayal of Nazi Amon GÃ¶th in Schindler 's List ( 1993 ) and mention of a Best Supporting Actor Oscar nomination , reaching beyond being typecast as an historical villain , Isaacs chose to play a drag queen in his next project , Sweet November ( 2001 ) , a romantic comedy - drama starring Charlize Theron and Keanu Reeves .
