Since 1999 , the leading Hubble outreach group in Europe has been the Hubble European Space Agency Information Centre ( HEIC ) . This office was established at the Space Telescope European Coordinating Facility in Munich , Germany . HEIC 's mission is to fulfill HST outreach and education tasks for the European Space Agency . The work is centered on the production of news and photo releases that highlight interesting Hubble results and images . These are often European in origin , and so increase awareness of both ESA 's Hubble share ( 15 % ) and the contribution of European scientists to the observatory . ESA produces educational material , including a videocast series called Hubblecast designed to share world - class scientific news with the public .
