Baron and his colleagues conducted a second eyewitness study that focused on normative influence . In this version , the task was easier . Each participant had five seconds to look at a slide instead of just one second . Once again , there were both high and low motives to be accurate , but the results were the reverse of the first study . The low motivation group conformed 33 % of the time ( similar to Asch 's findings ) . The high motivation group conformed less at 16 % . These results show that when accuracy is not very important , it is better to get the wrong answer than to risk social disapproval .
