Charlemagne planned to continue the Frankish tradition of dividing his kingdom between all his heirs , but was unable to do so as only one son , Louis the Pious ( r . 814 -- 840 ) , was still alive by 813 . Just before Charlemagne died in 814 , he crowned Louis as his successor . Louis 's reign of 26 years was marked by numerous divisions of the empire among his sons and , after 829 , civil wars between various alliances of father and sons over the control of various parts of the empire . Eventually , Louis recognised his eldest son Lothair I ( d . 855 ) as emperor and gave him Italy . Louis divided the rest of the empire between Lothair and Charles the Bald ( d . 877 ) , his youngest son . Lothair took East Francia , comprising both banks of the Rhine and eastwards , leaving Charles West Francia with the empire to the west of the Rhineland and the Alps . Louis the German ( d . 876 ) , the middle child , who had been rebellious to the last , was allowed to keep Bavaria under the suzerainty of his elder brother . The division was disputed . Pepin II of Aquitaine ( d. after 864 ) , the emperor 's grandson , rebelled in a contest for Aquitaine , while Louis the German tried to annex all of East Francia . Louis the Pious died in 840 , with the empire still in chaos .
