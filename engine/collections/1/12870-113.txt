In the live - action film , Belle is seen during the first song buying one of the Baker 's foods and his discussion to Belle was transferred to Jean Potts . The Baker was seen when the Headmaster had roused the villagers into destroying Belle 's laundry invention after the Headmaster caught Belle teaching a girl how to read . Like the animated film , the Baker is among the villagers that accompany Gaston and Le Fou to the Beast 's castle to kill the Beast only for the villagers to be fended off by the transformed servants .
