William sent an advance party to prepare the city for his entrance , to celebrate his victory and found a castle ; in the words of William 's biographer , William of Poitiers , `` certain fortifications were completed in the city against the restlessness of the huge and brutal populace . For he ( William ) realised that it was of the first importance to overawe the Londoners '' . At the time , London was the largest town in England ; the foundation of Westminster Abbey and the old Palace of Westminster under Edward the Confessor had marked it as a centre of governance , and with a prosperous port it was important for the Normans to establish control over the settlement . The other two castles in London -- Baynard 's Castle and Montfichet 's Castle -- were established at the same time . The fortification that would later become known as the Tower of London was built onto the south - east corner of the Roman town walls , using them as prefabricated defences , with the River Thames providing additional protection from the south . This earliest phase of the castle would have been enclosed by a ditch and defended by a timber palisade , and probably had accommodation suitable for William .
