Temples were sometimes referred to in hieroglyphic texts as k'uh nah , meaning `` god 's house '' . Temples were raised on platforms , most often upon a pyramid . The earliest temples were probably thatched huts built upon low platforms . By the Late Preclassic period , their walls were of stone , and the development of the corbel arch allowed stone roofs to replace thatch . By the Classic period , temple roofs were being topped with roof combs that extended the height of the temple and served as a foundation for monumental art . The temple shrines contained between one and three rooms , and were dedicated to important deities . Such a deity might be one of the patron gods of the city , or a deified ancestor . In general , freestanding pyramids were shrines honouring powerful ancestors .
