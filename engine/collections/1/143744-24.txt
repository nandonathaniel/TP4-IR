Since the Ti plasmid is essential to cause disease , prepenetration events in the rhizosphere occur to promote bacterial conjugation - exchange of plasmids amongst bacteria . In the presence of opines , A. tumefaciens produces a diffusible conjugation signal called 30C8HSL or the Agrobacterium autoinducer . This activates the transcription factor TraR , positively regulating the transcription of genes required for conjugation .
