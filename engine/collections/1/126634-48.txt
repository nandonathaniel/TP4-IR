The Extension of the Missouri Compromise line was proposed by failed amendments to the Wilmot Proviso by William W. Wick and then Stephen Douglas to extend the Missouri Compromise line ( 36 Â° 30 ' parallel north ) west to the Pacific ( south of Carmel - by - the - Sea , California ) to allow the possibility of slavery in most of present - day New Mexico and Arizona , and Southern California . That line was again proposed by the Nashville Convention of June 1850 .
