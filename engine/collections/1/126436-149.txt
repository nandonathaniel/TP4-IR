Puerto Rico does not have any coal , natural gas , nor oil reserves so it must import all its fuel in order to produce energy . The Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority ( PREPA ) , a government - owned corporation , produces 70 % of all energy in Puerto Rico through several power plants dependent on fossil fuels . 58 % of PREPA 's budget goes directly to these costs . Additional indirect costs of imported fossil fuels are paid through power purchase agreements for the 30 % of the country 's energy produced through private companies dependent on fossil fuels . To meet energy demands , Puerto Rico must import oil at a rate of 8.0 billion kWh and about 1,499,196 km3 of natural gas per year ( 44 ) as well as a very large amount of coal .
