Today , many different types of technologies exist in which splice sites can be located and analyzed for more information . The Human Splicing Finder is an online database stemming from the Human Genome Project data . The genome database identifies thousands of mutations related to medical and health fields , as well as providing critical research information regarding splice site mutations . The tool specifically searches for pre-mRNA splicing errors , the calculation of potential splice sites using complex algorithms , and correlation with several other online genomic databases , such as the Ensembl genome browser .
