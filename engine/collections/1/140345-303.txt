Non-denominational Muslims is an umbrella term that has been used for and by Muslims who do not belong to or do not self - identify with a specific Islamic denomination . Prominent figures who refused to identify with a particular Islamic denomination have included Jamal ad - Din al - Afghani , Muhammad Iqbal and Muhammad Ali Jinnah . Recent surveys report that large proportions of Muslims in some parts of the world self - identify as `` just Muslim '' , although there is little published analysis available regarding the motivations underlying this response . The Pew Research Center reports that respondents self - identifying as `` just Muslim '' make up a majority of Muslims in seven countries ( and a plurality in three others ) , with the highest proportion in Kazakhstan at 74 % . At least one in five Muslims in at least 22 countries self - identify in this way .
