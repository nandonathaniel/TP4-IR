Henry 's premature death in 1422 , at the age of 36 , led to his only son Henry VI coming to the throne as an infant and the country being ruled by a divided Council of regency . Henry V 's younger brothers produced no surviving legitimate issue , leaving only distant cousins ( the Beauforts ) as alternative Lancaster heirs . As Richard of York grew into maturity and questions were raised over Henry VI 's fitness to rule , Richard 's claim to the throne thus became more significant . The revenue from the York and March estates also made him the wealthiest magnate in the land .
