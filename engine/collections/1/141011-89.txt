The New Yorker describes what it calls this `` strangely but tellingly misbegotten '' cover design thusly : `` The image is a photograph , taken from a French fashion shoot , of a glassy - eyed , heavily made - up little girl . Behind her sits , a mother figure , stiff and coiffed , casting an ominous shadow . The girl , with her long , perfectly waved platinum - blond hair and her pink feather boa , looks like a pretty and inert doll -- '' The article continues : `` And if the Stepford daughter on the cover is meant to remind us of Veruca Salt or Violet Beauregarde , she does n't : those badly behaved squirts are bubbling over with rude life . '' Moreover , writes Talbot , `` The Modern Classics cover has not a whiff of this validation of childish imagination ; instead , it seems to imply a deviant adult audience . ''
