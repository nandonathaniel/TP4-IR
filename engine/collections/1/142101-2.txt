The concept of the bayonet , which is essentially the idea of improvising a firearm as a pike , probably evolved from the early concept of spears having firearms being attached to them , also known as `` Fire lances '' . Various forms of fire lances were recorded in the 14th century Chinese gunpowder military treatise Huolongjing including the Fire lance and the Pear Flower Lance . These examples demonstrated a clear need for a form of hybrid weapon as such weapons only have a firing range of 3 meters or less , meaning reloading is almost impossible during an encounter with enemy forces and an immediate melee backup weapon is necessary . The first clearly recorded instance of a bayonet proper is found in the Chinese military treatise Binglu published in 1606 , in the form of the Son - and - mother gun , a breech - loading musket that was issued with a plug bayonet that was roughly 57.6 centimetres in length and have an overall length of 1.92 meters with the bayonet attached . It was labelled as a `` gun - blade '' with it being described as a `` short sword that can be inserted into the barrel and secured by twisting it slightly '' that it is to be used `` when the battle have depleted both gunpowder and bullets as well as fighting against rebels / bandits , forces closing into melee or encountering an ambush '' and if one `` can not load the gun within the time it takes to cover two bu ( 3.2 meters ) of ground they are to attach the bayonet and hold it like a spear '' .
