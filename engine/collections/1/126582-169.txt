After some taunting , Vegeta initiates a transformation that produces a form beyond that of Super Saiyan - evidenced by increased muscle size and an intense golden aura . As an Ascended Super Saiyan , Vegeta makes easy work of Cell while Trunks watches from the sidelines . Meanwhile , Goku and Gohan begin their training in the Hyperbolic Time Chamber , where Goku states that he will not only make Gohan a Super Saiyan , but that he will make Gohan stronger than even himself .
