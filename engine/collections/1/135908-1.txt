Three dimensional mathematical shapes are also assigned volumes . Volumes of some simple shapes , such as regular , straight - edged , and circular shapes can be easily calculated using arithmetic formulas . Volumes of a complicated shape can be calculated by integral calculus if a formula exists for the shape 's boundary . Where a variance in shape and volume occurs , such as those that exist between different human beings , these can be calculated using three - dimensional techniques such as the Body Volume Index . One - dimensional figures ( such as lines ) and two - dimensional shapes ( such as squares ) are assigned zero volume in the three - dimensional space .
