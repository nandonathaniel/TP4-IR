Groves expected to have another atomic bomb ready for use on August 19 , with three more in September and a further three in October . On August 10 , he sent a memorandum to Marshall in which he wrote that `` the next bomb ... should be ready for delivery on the first suitable weather after 17 or 18 August . '' Marshall endorsed the memo with the hand - written comment , `` It is not to be released over Japan without express authority from the President '' , something Truman had requested that day . This modified the previous order that the target cities were to be attacked with atomic bombs `` as made ready '' . There was already discussion in the War Department about conserving the bombs then in production for Operation Downfall , and Marshall suggested to Stimson that the remaining cities on the target list be spared attack with atomic bombs .
