Double depression occurs when a person experiences a major depressive episode on top of the already - existing condition of dysthymia . It is difficult to treat , as sufferers accept these major depressive symptoms as a natural part of their personality or as a part of their life that is outside of their control . The fact that people with dysthymia may accept these worsening symptoms as inevitable can delay treatment . When and if such people seek out treatment , the treatment may not be very effective if only the symptoms of the major depression are addressed , but not the dysthymic symptoms . Patients with double depression tend to report significantly higher levels of hopelessness than is normal . This can be a useful symptom for mental health services providers to focus on when working with patients to treat the condition . Additionally , cognitive therapies can be effective for working with people with double depression in order to help change negative thinking patterns and give individuals a new way of seeing themselves and their environment .
