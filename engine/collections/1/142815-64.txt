Atchison started his screenplay in 1999 , when he wrote a five - page treatment in about a month . In addition to the fact he was working on other projects , Atchison said he waited years before starting to write because he `` thought someone else would do it first . '' This did not happen , so he began to write by himself . Few changes were made in the process of transitioning from the original draft to the final product . One change was that at first , Akeelah 's mother had a smaller role and Akeelah 's father was alive . Also , Larabee had been an older man ( 72 years old ) , and a few characters were cut . However , Atchison has summarized that `` the steps she goes through , the friends she 's got , those were always the same . ''
