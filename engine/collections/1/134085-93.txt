In addition , English has many Arabic loanwords , some directly , but most via other Mediterranean languages . Examples of such words include admiral , adobe , alchemy , alcohol , algebra , algorithm , alkaline , almanac , amber , arsenal , assassin , candy , carat , cipher , coffee , cotton , ghoul , hazard , jar , kismet , lemon , loofah , magazine , mattress , sherbet , sofa , sumac , tariff , and many other words . Other languages such as Maltese and Kinubi derive ultimately from Arabic , rather than merely borrowing vocabulary or grammatical rules .
