In 2007 , artist Matt Haley began work on a graphic novel continuation , which he hoped would be included in the `` Complete Mystery '' DVD box set . Twin Peaks producer Robert Engels agreed to help write it on the condition that Lynch and Frost approved the project ; Haley said : `` ( Engels ) and I had a number of discussions about what the story would be . I was keen to use whatever notes they had for the proposed third season . I really wanted this to be a literal ' third season ' of the show . '' Paramount Home Entertainment agreed to package it with the box set , also on the condition that Lynch and Frost approved . Though Frost approved the project , Lynch vetoed it , stating that he respected the effort but did not want to continue the story of Twin Peaks .
