Substance abuse and substance dependence from DSM - IV - TR have been combined into single substance use disorders specific to each substance of abuse within a new `` addictions and related disorders '' category . `` Recurrent legal problems '' was deleted and `` craving or a strong desire or urge to use a substance '' was added to the criteria . The threshold of the number of criteria that must be met was changed and severity from mild to severe is based on the number of criteria endorsed . Criteria for cannabis and caffeine withdrawal were added . New specifiers were added for early and sustained remission along with new specifiers for `` in a controlled environment '' and `` on maintenance therapy '' .
