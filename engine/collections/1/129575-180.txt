`` Orthodox '' accounts place responsibility for the Cold War on the Soviet Union and its expansion further into Europe . `` Revisionist '' writers place more responsibility for the breakdown of post-war peace on the United States , citing a range of US efforts to isolate and confront the Soviet Union well before the end of World War II . `` Post-revisionists '' see the events of the Cold War as more nuanced , and attempt to be more balanced in determining what occurred during the Cold War . Much of the historiography on the Cold War weaves together two or even all three of these broad categories .
