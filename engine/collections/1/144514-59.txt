The Walking Dead was included on the cover of the December 2010 edition of Entertainment Weekly , which featured Rick Grimes pointing a gun at a horde of walkers . According to the journalist of the magazine , it `` examines the past , present , and future '' of the television franchise ; `` from the comic book 's humble beginnings , to unlikely path to the small screen , to even more unlikely path as a bona fide hit . '' Kirkman was ecstatic upon hearing of the news . `` I 've got to say -- not to kiss your magazine 's a -- or anything -- but when they called me and said Frank ( Darabont ) wanted to do the show , I was like , ' Yeah , I 'll believe it when I see it . ' And then when AMC was like , ' We 're picking up the show , ' I was like , ' Yeah , alright , whatever . ' When they actually started shooting the pilot I was like , ' Well , this is kind of real , this is neat . ' But when they called me and said , ' Your show 's on the cover of Entertainment Weekly , ' I think that was the first time I was like , ' Oh my god , I ca n't believe this is happening to me ! ' ''
