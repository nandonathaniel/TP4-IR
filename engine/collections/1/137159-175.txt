Sometimes the Yellow River is poetically called the `` Muddy Flow '' ( simplified Chinese : 浊 流 ; traditional Chinese : 濁 流 ; pinyin : Zhuó Liú ) . The Chinese idiom `` when the Yellow River flows clear '' is used to refer to an event that will never happen and is similar to the English expression `` when pigs fly '' .
