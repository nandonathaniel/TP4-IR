A team lead by Johannes Krause managed the first reliable sequencing of the genomes of 90 mummified individuals in 2017 . Whilst not conclusive , because of the non-exhaustive time frame and restricted location that the mummies represent , their study nevertheless showed that these ancient Egyptians `` closely resembled ancient and modern Near Eastern populations , especially those in the Levant , and had almost no DNA from sub-Saharan Africa . What 's more , the genetics of the mummies remained remarkably consistent even as different powers -- including Nubians , Greeks , and Romans -- conquered the empire . '' Later , however , something did alter the genomes of Egyptians . Some 15 % to 20 % of modern Egyptians ' DNA reflects sub-Saharan ancestry , but the ancient mummies had only 6 - 15 % sub-Saharan DNA .
