The Socialist Party of America was a highly factionalized coalition of local parties based in industrial cities and usually was rooted in ethnic communities , especially German and Finnish . It also had some support in old Populist rural and mining areas in the West , especially Oklahoma . By 1912 , the party claimed more than a thousand locally elected officials in 33 states and 160 cities , especially the Midwest . Eugene V. Debs had run for president in 1900 , 1904 , and 1908 , primarily to encourage the local effort , and he did so again in 1912 and from prison in 1920 .
