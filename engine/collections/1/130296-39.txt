Along with Harvard and Princeton , Yale students rejected elite British concepts about ' amateurism ' in sports and constructed athletic programs that were uniquely American , such as football . The Harvard -- Yale football rivalry began in 1875 . Between 1892 , when Harvard and Yale met in one of the first intercollegiate debates and 1909 ( the year of the first Triangular Debate of Harvard , Yale and Princeton ) the rhetoric , symbolism , and metaphors used in athletics were used to frame these early debates . Debates were covered on front pages of college newspapers and emphasized in yearbooks , and team members even received the equivalent of athletic letters for their jackets . There even were rallies sending off the debating teams to matches , but the debates never attained the broad appeal that athletics enjoyed . One reason may be that debates do not have a clear winner , as is the case in sports , and that scoring is subjective . In addition , with late 19th - century concerns about the impact of modern life on the human body , athletics offered hope that neither the individual nor the society was coming apart .
