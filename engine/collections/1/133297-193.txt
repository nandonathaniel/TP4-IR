By 1941 the conflict had become a stalemate . Although Japan had occupied much of northern , central , and coastal China , the Nationalist Government had retreated to the interior with a provisional capital set up at Chungking while the Chinese communists remained in control of base areas in Shaanxi . In addition , Japanese control of northern and central China was somewhat tenuous , in that Japan was usually able to control railroads and the major cities ( `` points and lines '' ) , but did not have a major military or administrative presence in the vast Chinese countryside . The Japanese found its aggression against the retreating and regrouping Chinese army was stalled by the mountainous terrain in southwestern China while the Communists organised widespread guerrilla and saboteur activities in northern and eastern China behind the Japanese front line .
