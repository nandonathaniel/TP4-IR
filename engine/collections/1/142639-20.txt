Auditory processing disorder -- Auditory information in the brain is processed in an abnormal way . Patients with auditory processing disorder can usually gain the information normally , but their brain can not process it properly , leading to hearing disability . Auditory verbal agnosia -- Comprehension of speech is lost but hearing , speaking , reading , and writing ability is retained . This is caused by damage to the posterior superior temporal lobes , again not allowing the brain to process auditory input correctly .
