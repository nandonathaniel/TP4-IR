Chlorine is usually used ( in the form of hypochlorous acid ) to kill bacteria and other microbes in drinking water supplies and public swimming pools . In most private swimming pools , chlorine itself is not used , but rather sodium hypochlorite , formed from chlorine and sodium hydroxide , or solid tablets of chlorinated isocyanurates . The drawback of using chlorine in swimming pools is that the chlorine reacts with the proteins in human hair and skin . The distinctive ' chlorine aroma ' associated with swimming pools is not the result of chlorine itself , but of chloramine , a chemical compound produced by the reaction of free dissolved chlorine with amines in organic substances . Even small water supplies are now routinely chlorinated .
