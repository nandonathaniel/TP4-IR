In Anglicanism there is a distinction between liturgy , which is the formal public and communal worship of the Church , and personal prayer and devotion which may be public or private . Liturgy is regulated by the prayer books and consists of the Holy Eucharist ( some call it Holy Communion or Mass ) , the other six Sacraments , and the Divine Office or Liturgy of the Hours .
