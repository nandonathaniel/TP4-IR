Most of these villages were part of a minor chiefdom centered on a large village known as Chiaha , which was located on an island now submerged by Douglas Lake . The 1540 expedition of Hernando de Soto and the 1567 expedition of Juan Pardo passed through the French Broad River valley north of the Smokies , both spending a considerable amount of time at Chiaha . The Pardo expedition followed a trail across the flanks of Chilhowee Mountain to the Mississippian - period villages at Chilhowee and Citico ( Pardo 's notary called them by their Muskogean names , `` Chalahume '' and `` Satapo '' ) .
