Through this period , the NBA continued to evolve with the shift of the Minneapolis Lakers to Los Angeles , the Philadelphia Warriors to San Francisco , the Syracuse Nationals to Philadelphia to become the Philadelphia 76ers , and the St. Louis Hawks moving to Atlanta , as well as the addition of its first expansion franchises . The Chicago Packers ( now Washington Wizards ) became the ninth NBA team in 1961 . From 1966 to 1968 , the league expanded from 9 to 14 teams , introducing the Chicago Bulls , Seattle SuperSonics ( now Oklahoma City Thunder ) , San Diego Rockets ( who relocated to Houston four years later ) , Milwaukee Bucks , and Phoenix Suns .
