( Coupling of DIT to MIT in the opposite order yields a substance , r-T , which is biologically inactive. ) Hydrolysis ( cleavage to individual amino acids ) of the modified protein by proteases then liberates T3 and T4 , as well as the non-coupled tyrosine derivatives MIT and DIT . The hormones T and T are the biologically active agents central to metabolic regulation .
