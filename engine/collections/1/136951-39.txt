Patel practised law in Godhra , Borsad , and Anand while taking on the financial burdens of his homestead in Karamsad. Patel was the first chairman and founder of `` Edward Memorial High School '' Borsad , today known as Jhaverbhai Dajibhai Patel High School . When he had saved enough for his trip to England and applied for a pass and a ticket , they were addressed to `` V. J. Patel , '' at the home of his elder brother Vithalbhai , who had the same initials as Vallabhai . Having once nurtured a similar hope to study in England , Vithalbhai remonstrated his younger brother , saying that it would be disreputable for an older brother to follow his younger brother . In keeping with concerns for his family 's honour , Patel allowed Vithalbhai to go in his place .
