The school 's historic coat of arms is used on official documentation including degree certificates and transcripts and includes the motto -- rerum cognoscere causas , a line taken from Virgil 's Georgics meaning `` to know the causes of things '' , together with the school 's mascot -- a beaver . Both these symbols , adopted in February 1922 , continue to be held in high regard to this day with the beaver chosen because of its representation as `` a hard working and industrious yet sociable animal '' , attributes that the founders hoped LSE students to both possess and aspire to . The school 's weekly newspaper is still entitled The Beaver , Rosebery residence hall 's bar is called the Tipsy Beaver and LSE sports teams are known as the Beavers . The institution has two sets of colours -- brand and academic -- red being the brand colour used on signage , publications and in buildings across campus and purple , black and gold for academic purposes including presentation ceremonies and graduation dress .
