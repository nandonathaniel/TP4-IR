Giraffes are usually found in groups . Traditionally , the composition of these groups has been described as open and ever - changing . Giraffes were thought to have few social bonds and for research purposes , a `` group '' has been defined as `` a collection of individuals that are less than a kilometre apart and moving in the same general direction . '' More recent studies have found that giraffes do have long - term social associations and may form groups or pairs based on kinship , sex or other factors . These groups may regularly associate with one another in larger communities or sub-communities within a fission -- fusion society . The number of giraffes in a group can range up to 44 individuals .
