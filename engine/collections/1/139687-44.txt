In 494 BC Rome was at war with three Italic tribes ( the Aequi , Sabines and Volsci ) , but the Plebeian soldiers advised by Lucius Sicinius Vellutus refused to march against the enemy , and instead seceded to the Sacred Mount outside Rome . A settlement was negotiated and the patricians agreed that the plebs be given the right to elect their own officials . The Plebeians named these new officials Plebeian Tribunes ( tribuni plebis ) .
