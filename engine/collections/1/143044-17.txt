Cornelius Vanderbilt , an entrepreneur from Stapleton , Staten Island , who would become one of the world 's richest people , started a ferry from Staten Island to Manhattan in 1810 . Cornelius was 16 years old at the time and had sailed extensively enough in his father 's periauger that he could easily navigate the New York Harbor Estuary on his own . He earned $100 for his birthday in May 1810 , which he used to purchase a periauger called the Swiftsure that he then used to transport passengers from Staten Island to the Battery at Manhattan 's tip . Vanderbilt competed against other boatmen providing service in the harbor , who jokingly called `` Commodore '' because of his youthful eagerness ; that nickname applied to him for the rest of his life . After the War of 1812 limited access to New York Harbor from elsewhere along the East Coast , Vanderbilt made profits from carrying cargo along the Hudson River ; he bought extra boats with these profits . After the war , he transported cargo in the harbor , earning even more money and buying more boats .
