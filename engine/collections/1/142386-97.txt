In 1998 , Rowling sold the film rights of the first four Harry Potter books to Warner Bros. for a reported Â£ 1 million ( $1,982,900 ) . Rowling demanded the principal cast be kept strictly British , nonetheless allowing for the inclusion of Irish actors such as the late Richard Harris as Dumbledore , and for casting of French and Eastern European actors in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire where characters from the book are specified as such . After many directors including Steven Spielberg , Terry Gilliam , Jonathan Demme , and Alan Parker were considered , Chris Columbus was appointed on 28 March 2000 as the director for Harry Potter and the Philosopher 's Stone ( titled `` Harry Potter and the Sorcerer 's Stone '' in the United States ) , with Warner Bros. citing his work on other family films such as Home Alone and Mrs. Doubtfire and proven experience with directing children as influences for their decision .
