Hitler 's forces suppressed all opposition . Before the first German soldier crossed the border , Heinrich Himmler and a few SS officers landed in Vienna to arrest prominent representatives of the First Republic , such as Richard Schmitz , Leopold Figl , Friedrich Hillegeist , and Franz Olah . During the few weeks between the Anschluss and the plebiscite , authorities rounded up Social Democrats , Communists , other potential political dissenters , and Jews , and imprisoned them or sent them to concentration camps . Within a few days of 12 March , 70,000 people had been arrested . The disused northwest railway station in Vienna was converted into a makeshift concentration camp . The plebiscite was subject to large - scale propaganda and to the abrogation of the voting rights of around 400,000 people ( nearly 10 % of the eligible voting population ) , mainly former members of left - wing parties and Jews .
