Calgary were repeating President 's Trophy champions in the 1988 -- 89 regular season , and they met their Smythe Division rivals the Vancouver Canucks for the first round of the playoffs . Despite finishing 43 points behind Calgary in the regular season , Vancouver pushed Calgary to seven games . They started with a 4 -- 3 overtime win in game 1 . Calgary bounced back and took the next two games , but the teams would alternate victories until they were deadlocked up to game seven . Here , the Flames would take control twice , only to see the Canucks tie the game each time , eventually forcing overtime . Here , the Canucks then saw a strong chance to win , with veteran forward Stan Smyl coming in with the puck on a breakaway towards Calgary goalie Mike Vernon . With a wide open chance , Smyl sped in on goal , shot the puck high on Vernon 's glove side , and Vernon made what would become one of the most famous save in Stanley Cup play , swiftly gloving the puck in his trapper . After the save , Vernon then fell backwards into the goal ( being sure to keep his glove - hand outside ) in a show of relief for having made the save . Calgary forward Joel Otto then scored the game winner at the 19 : 21 mark of overtime , winning the game and the series . The Flames went on to win the Stanley Cup that year . Eventual Conn Smythe Trophy winner Al MacInnis specifically gave a strong endorsement of Vernon for his work in that year 's playoffs , especially noting that his performance in game 7 's overtime against the Canucks was the reason they made it that far .
