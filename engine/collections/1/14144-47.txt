Another example is the acquittal in 1989 of Michael Randle and Pat Pottle , who confessed in open court to charges of springing the Soviet spy George Blake from Wormwood Scrubs Prison and smuggling him to East Germany in 1966 . Pottle successfully appealed to the jury to disregard the judge 's instruction that they consider only whether the defendants were guilty in law , and assert a jury 's ancient right to throw out a politically motivated prosecution , in this case compounded by its cynical untimeliness .
