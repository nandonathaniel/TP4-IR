Neil Armstrong became the first person to walk on the Moon as the commander of the American mission Apollo 11 by first setting foot on the Moon at 02 : 56 UTC on 21 July 1969 . An estimated 500 million people worldwide watched the transmission by the Apollo TV camera , the largest television audience for a live broadcast at that time . The Apollo missions 11 to 17 ( except Apollo 13 , which aborted its planned lunar landing ) returned 380.05 kilograms ( 837.87 lb ) of lunar rock and soil in 2,196 separate samples . The American Moon landing and return was enabled by considerable technological advances in the early 1960s , in domains such as ablation chemistry , software engineering , and atmospheric re-entry technology , and by highly competent management of the enormous technical undertaking .
