These changes led to a significant concentration of cross-media ownership . By 1960 , the Packer family 's Consolidated Press group controlled Channels 9 in Melbourne and Sydney ( the flagship stations that formed the basis of the Nine Network ) , Melbourne 's Herald and Weekly Times group owned HSV - 7 , and the Fairfax newspaper group controlled ATN - 7 in Sydney . In the view of some media historians , these arrangements established a pattern of `` high - level political allegiances between commercial broadcasters and Liberal - National Party governments '' and that , as a result , the ABCB `` was left very weak and uncertain in its capacity to control broadcaster conduct and exhibited strong symptoms of regulatory capture , or over-identification with the industry it regulated '' .
