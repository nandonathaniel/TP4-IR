The aesthetics scholar David Marshall draws out this theme even further by noting that the loss of identity reaches its fullness in the description of the mechanicals and their assumption of other identities . In describing the occupations of the acting troupe , he writes `` Two construct or put together , two mend and repair , one weaves and one sews . All join together what is apart or mend what has been rent , broken , or sundered . '' In Marshall 's opinion , this loss of individual identity not only blurs specificities , it creates new identities found in community , which Marshall points out may lead to some understanding of Shakespeare 's opinions on love and marriage . Further , the mechanicals understand this theme as they take on their individual parts for a corporate performance of Pyramus and Thisbe . Marshall remarks that `` To be an actor is to double and divide oneself , to discover oneself in two parts : both oneself and not oneself , both the part and not the part . '' He claims that the mechanicals understand this and that each character , particularly among the lovers , has a sense of laying down individual identity for the greater benefit of the group or pairing . It seems that a desire to lose one 's individuality and find identity in the love of another is what quietly moves the events of A Midsummer Night 's Dream . As the primary sense of motivation , this desire is reflected even in the scenery depictions and the story 's overall mood .
