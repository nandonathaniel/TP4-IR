However , Castiel later returns -- still in Jimmy Novak 's body -- in the fifth - season premiere , `` Sympathy for the Devil '' , killing two fellow angels in order to save Sam and Dean . He is uncertain as to how he was resurrected , but alludes to Zachariah it may have been God 's doing . After ordering Zachariah away , Castiel carves Enochian sigils into Sam and Dean 's ribs to hide them from all angels , including Lucifer . Castiel later returns to the brothers in `` Good God Y'All ! '' , and reveals his plans to find God . He borrows Dean 's amulet , as it burns hot in God 's presence , and departs . He has also been completely cut off from Heaven as a result of his rebellion and has lost some of his powers as a result , including his ability to heal injuries . He remains on Earth hunting for God , although acquires a cellphone so that the Winchesters can call for his aid when dealing with particularly challenging cases , such as their discovery of the Antichrist or their latest confrontation with the Trickster ( who is revealed to be the lost archangel Gabriel ) .
