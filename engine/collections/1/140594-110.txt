Gort had ordered Lieutenant General Adam , commanding III Corps , and French General Fagalde to prepare a perimeter defence of Dunkirk . The perimeter was semicircular , with French troops manning the western sector and British troops the eastern . It ran along the Belgian coastline from Nieuport in the east via Furnes , Bulskamp and Bergues to Gravelines in the west . The line was made as strong as possible under the circumstances , but on 28 May the Belgian army , who were largely outnumbered by the attacking Germans , and still under the direct command of King Leopold , who had refused to abandon his troops and the Belgian refugees inside the little enclave of what remained of unoccupied Belgium , surrendered . This left a 20 mi ( 32 km ) gap in Gort 's eastern flank between the British and the sea . The British were surprised by the Belgian capitulation , despite King Leopold warning them in advance . As a constitutional monarch , Leopold 's decision to surrender without consulting the Belgian government led to his condemnation by the Belgian and French Prime Ministers , Hubert Pierlot and Paul Reynaud .
