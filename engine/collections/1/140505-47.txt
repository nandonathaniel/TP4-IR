In February 2007 , a group called LOVE ( the Livingston Organization for Values in Education ) challenged four books in the Howell High School curriculum , including The Bluest Eye . Black Boy by Richard Wright , Slaughterhouse Five by Kurt Vonnegut , and The Freedom Writers Diary were also challenged . Vicki Fyke , the founder of LOVE , challenged the books due to their images of sex , rape , and incest , claiming that inclusion of these books in a high school curriculum did not comply with federal child pornography and obscenity laws , and was against Michigan 's sexual education laws . In addition to Fyke , some members of the school board and parents were against the curriculum , one arguing , `` At the end of the day , they 're my kids . I do n't want my kids to read ( these books ) . I do n't let them eat just anything ... I want you to respect that '' . The school board Vice President also argued that parents should receive warnings of the type of material that is discussed in their children 's curricula , and that students should have the option to avoid a particular book based on content . The National Coalition Against Censorship published a letter in response to the criticism , claiming that scenes involving sex `` represent small but essential parts of the novels , consistent with the kind of material that high school students frequently read '' . Their letter also argued that the books in question `` are widely recognized as works of significant literary and artistic merit '' , and `` are widely taught in high schools and colleges around the country '' .
