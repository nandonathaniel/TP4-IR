It is , however , not the shortage of letters which makes English spelling irregular . Its irregularities are caused mainly by the use of many different spellings for some of its sounds , such as the sounds / uː / , / iː / and / oʊ / ( too , true , shoe , flew , through ; sleeve , leave , even , seize , siege ; stole , coal , bowl , roll , old , mould ) , and the use of identical sequences for spelling different sounds ( over , oven , move ) .
