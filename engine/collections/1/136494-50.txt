The only true animatronic in the third game is Springtrap , who looks like a decayed golden version of Bonnie . Additionally , Freddy , Chica , Foxy , Balloon Boy , Mangle , and The Puppet return as hallucinations ( or `` phantoms '' ) , and although their jumpscares do n't kill the player , they can disable certain features that are essential for the player to complete the night easily .
