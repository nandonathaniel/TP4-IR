Metals make relatively good conductors of heat , primarily because the delocalized electrons are free to transport thermal energy between atoms . However , unlike electrical conductivity , the thermal conductivity of a metal is nearly independent of temperature . This is expressed mathematically by the Wiedemann -- Franz law , which states that the ratio of thermal conductivity to the electrical conductivity is proportional to the temperature . The thermal disorder in the metallic lattice increases the electrical resistivity of the material , producing a temperature dependence for electric current .
