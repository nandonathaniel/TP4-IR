MSUD is a metabolic disorder caused by a deficiency of the branched - chain alpha - keto acid dehydrogenase complex ( BCKDC ) , leading to a buildup of the branched - chain amino acids ( leucine , isoleucine , and valine ) and their toxic by - products ( ketoacids ) in the blood and urine . The enzyme complex consists of four subunits designated E α , E β , E , and E. The E subunit is also a component of pyruvate dehydrogenase complex and oxoglutarate dehydrogenase complex . MSUD can result from mutations in any of the genes that code for the enzyme subunits .
