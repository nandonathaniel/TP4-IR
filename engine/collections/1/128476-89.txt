Lightning McQueen , often referred to as `` McQueen '' , is the main character in Cars and Cars 3 . He is voiced by Owen Wilson in the films , Mater and the Ghostlight , Cars : The Video Game and the last episode of Cars Toons : Tales from Radiator Springs and by Keith Ferguson in all other media . McQueen is not modeled directly after a specific make and model , although his design contains some elements inspired by the Chevrolet Corvette C6 . His Corvette lineage is further suggested by the `` retro '' paint scheme he acquires in Radiator Springs , which resembles that of a Corvette C1 .
