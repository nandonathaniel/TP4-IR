The stomach of Artiodactyls is divided into four sections : the rumen , the reticulum , the omasum and the abomasum ( only ruminants have a rumen ) . After the plant material is consumed , it is mixed with saliva in the rumen and reticulum and separates into solid and liquid material . The solids lump together to form a bolus ( or cud ) , and is regurgitated . When the bolus enters the mouth , the fluid is squeezed out with the tongue and swallowed again . Ingested food passes to the rumen and reticulum where cellulytic microbes ( bacteria , protozoa and fungi ) produce cellulase , which is needed to break down the cellulose in plants . Perissodactyls , in contrast to the ruminants , store digested food that has left the stomach in an enlarged cecum , where it is fermented by bacteria . Carnivora have a simple stomach adapted to digest primarily meat , as compared to the elaborate digestive systems of herbivorous animals , which are necessary to break down tough , complex plant fibers . The caecum is either absent or short and simple , and the large intestine is not sacculated or much wider than the small intestine .
