Snow flurry , snow storm and blizzard describe snow events of progressively greater duration and intensity . A blizzard is a weather condition involving snow and has varying definitions in different parts of the world . In the United States , a blizzard occurs when two conditions are met for a period of three hours or more : A sustained wind or frequent gusts to 35 miles per hour ( 56 km / h ) , and sufficient snow in the air to reduce visibility to less than 0.4 kilometers ( 0.25 mi ) . In Canada and the United Kingdom , the criteria are similar . While heavy snowfall often occurs during blizzard conditions , falling snow is not a requirement , as blowing snow can create a ground blizzard .
