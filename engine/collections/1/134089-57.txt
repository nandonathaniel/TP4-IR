Failed start - up leagues : During the 1970s , three `` official '' minor leagues attempted unsuccessfully to revive unaffiliated baseball within the organized baseball structure . These were the Class A Gulf States League ( 1976 ) and Lone Star League ( 1977 ) , and the Triple - A Inter -- American League ( 1979 ) . None lasted more than a full season .
