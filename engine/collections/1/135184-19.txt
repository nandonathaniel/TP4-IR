Important developments occurred in genre fiction in this era . Although pre-dated by John Ruskin 's The King of the Golden River in 1841 , the history of the modern fantasy genre is generally said to begin with George MacDonald , the influential author of The Princess and the Goblin and Phantastes ( 1858 ) . William Morris was a popular English poet who also wrote several fantasy novels during the latter part of the nineteenth century . Wilkie Collins ' epistolary novel The Moonstone ( 1868 ) , is generally considered the first detective novel in the English language , while The Woman in White is regarded as one of the finest sensation novels . H.G. Wells 's ( 1866 -- 1946 ) writing career began in the 1890s with science fiction novels like The Time Machine ( 1895 ) , and The War of the Worlds ( 1898 ) which describes an invasion of late Victorian England by Martians , and Wells is seen , along with Frenchman Jules Verne ( 1828 -- 1905 ) , as a major figure in the development of the science fiction genre . He also wrote realistic fiction about the lower middle class in novels like Kipps ( 1905 ) and The History of Mr Polly ( 1910 ) .
