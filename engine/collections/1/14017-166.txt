Jump up ^ At least one writer has this event taking place during the 1619 visit to Nemasket . It is unlikely , however , that Dermer would have omitted it from the letter he wrote to Purchas in December 1619 , given that Dermer included other conflicts with the Natives . It also is unlikely that Massasoit would have allowed him to redeem two French sailors if the Pokanoket were so furious with the English , especially after it took Squanto 's best efforts to prevent his own execution . Salisbury sets this event in 1620 , before the next encounter with Epenow , which seems to be the sense in which Bradford intended it to be read .
