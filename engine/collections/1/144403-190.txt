In 1884 Belva Ann Lockwood , the first female lawyer to argue a case before the U.S. Supreme Court , became the first woman to conduct a viable campaign for president . She was nominated , without her advance knowledge , by a California group called the Equal Rights Party . Lockwood advocated women 's suffrage and other reforms during a coast - to - coast campaign that received respectful coverage from at least some major periodicals . She financed her campaign partly by charging admission to her speeches . Neither the AWSA nor the NWSA , both of whom had already endorsed the Republican candidate for president , supported Lockwood 's candidacy .
