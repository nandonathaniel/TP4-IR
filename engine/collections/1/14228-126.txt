Realizing the danger of fragmentation , they attempted a reconciliation . Saint - Just and Couthon favored it , but Robespierre doubted sincerity of his enemies . It was he who brought about the fatal intervention of the Convention . On 8 Thermidor , Year II ( 26 July 1794 ) , he denounced his opponents , and demanded that `` unity of government '' be realized . When called upon to name those whom he was accusing , however , he refused . This failure destroyed him , for it was assumed that he was demanding a blank cheque . This night an uneasy alliance was formed from threatened deputies and members of The Plain . On the next day , 9 Thermidor , Robespierre and his friends were not allowed to speak , and their indictment was decreed . The men of the extreme left played the leading roles : Billaud - Varenne , who attacked , and Collot d'Herbois , who presided .
