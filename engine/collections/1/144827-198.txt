Internal control of techniques used in molecular biology , such as western blot and quantitative PCR . As actin is essential for cell survival it has been postulated that the quantity of actin is under such tight control at a cellular level that it can be assumed that its transcription ( that is , the degree to which its genes are expressed ) and translation , that is the production of protein , is practically constant and independent of experimental conditions . Therefore , it is common practice in protein quantification studies ( western blot ) and transcription studies ( quantitative PCR ) to carry out the quantification of the gene of interest and also the quantification of a reference gene such as the one that codes for actin . By dividing the quantity of the gene of interest by that of the actin gene it is possible to obtain a relative quantity that can be compared between different experiments , whenever the expression of the latter is constant . It is worth pointing out that actin does not always have the desired stability in its gene expression .
