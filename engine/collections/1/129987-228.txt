Lincoln 's moderate approach succeeded in inducing border states , War Democrats and emancipated slaves to fight for the Union . The Union - controlled border states ( Kentucky , Missouri , Maryland , Delaware and West Virginia ) and Union - controlled regions around New Orleans , Norfolk and elsewhere , were not covered by the Emancipation Proclamation . All abolished slavery on their own , except Kentucky and Delaware .
