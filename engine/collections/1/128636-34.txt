The lyrics of `` I Think Ur a Contra '' include the phrase `` Complete Control '' , the title of a Clash single ( notably , an influential 1980 triple album by The Clash was entitled Sandinista ! after the socialist militancy opposed by the Contras during the Nicaraguan civil war ) . This refers partially to the controversy surrounding their punk roots . The title `` Diplomat 's Son '' is a reference to a story singer Ezra Koenig wrote while in college about boarding school , though the content lyrically talks about a relationship told by Rostam Batmanglij . The song also features a vocal sample from M.I.A. 's `` Hussel '' . `` Holiday '' begins with the opening lyrics of Fairport Convention 's 1969 rendition of Matty Groves .
