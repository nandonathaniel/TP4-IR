Although Jackson was one of the most liberal members of the Democratic Party , his position on abortion was originally more in line with pro-life views . Within one month after the 1973 Supreme Court decision , Roe v. Wade , legalized abortion , Jackson began a PUSH campaign against the decision , calling abortion murder and declaring that Jesus and Moses might not have been born if abortion had been available in ancient times . Jackson 's strong rhetoric on abortion temporarily alienated one of his major supporters , T.R. M Howard , a black physician who made a living from performing abortions .
