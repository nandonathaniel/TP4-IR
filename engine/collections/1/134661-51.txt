The modular evolution theory for the origin of ATP synthase suggests that two subunits with independent function , a DNA helicase with ATPase activity and a H motor , were able to bind , and the rotation of the motor drove the ATPase activity of the helicase in reverse . This complex then evolved greater efficiency and eventually developed into today 's intricate ATP synthases . Alternatively , the DNA helicase / H motor complex may have had H pump activity with the ATPase activity of the helicase driving the H motor in reverse . This may have evolved to carry out the reverse reaction and act as an ATP synthase .
