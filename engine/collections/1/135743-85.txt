Some organizations have strongly supported defining and maintaining of a stable in - kernel ABI over several releases . For example , it would benefit hardware manufacturers which release proprietary kernel modules and distribute binary - only software ( e.g. device drivers ) . However , the Linux kernel developers choose not to maintain a stable in - kernel ABI . This allows Linux kernel development to happen much more quickly .
