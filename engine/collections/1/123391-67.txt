`` Education fails because it neglects this fundamental principle of the school as a form of community life . It conceives the school as a place where certain information is to be given , where certain lessons are to be learned , or where certain habits are to be formed '' ( Dewey , 1897 , para. 17 ) Dewey felt that as education is a social construct , it is , therefore , a part of society and should reflect the community .
