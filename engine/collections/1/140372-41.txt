Christian Bale as John Connor . Director McG , deemed Bale `` the most credible action star in the world '' during development . McG wanted Bale for Marcus , but the actor -- even though he `` ca n't really remember why '' -- wanted to play John , and that led to the character 's role getting expanded in rewrites of the script . Bale was the first person to be cast and signed on for the role in November 2007 . McG talked extensively with Bale in the UK about the role while the latter was filming The Dark Knight , and they both agreed to proceed . Although a fan of the Terminator series , he was at first uninterested until McG convinced him the story would be character - based and not rely on special effects . They kept working on the story every day , along with Worthington . McG said Bale broke his hand punching a Terminator prop during filming . Bale spent six to eight hours each day with McG in the editing room to advise the finished product . In January 2018 , Bale admitted that he rejected the role three times before accepting it , in part to prove people who told him not to take the role wrong .
