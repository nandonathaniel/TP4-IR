Estimates of the Queen 's wealth vary , depending on whether assets owned by her personally or held in trust for the nation are included . Forbes magazine estimated her wealth at US $450 million in 2010 , but no official figure is available . In 1993 , the Lord Chamberlain said estimates of £ 100 million were `` grossly overstated '' . Jock Colville , who was her former private secretary and a director of her bank , Coutts , estimated her wealth in 1971 at £ 2 million ( the equivalent of about £ 26 million today ) .
