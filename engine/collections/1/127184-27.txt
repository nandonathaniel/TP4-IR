A film adaptation of the book was in development . It was written and would have been directed by Danny DeVito , starring Morgan Freeman as Zachariah and Pierce Brosnan as Jaggery . Dakota Fanning was originally cast as Charlotte Doyle , but had to drop out as production was continually halted and she eventually grew too old for the part . Saoirse Ronan was later cast , but the film was again halted because Freeman was seriously injured in a car accident two weeks before filming was scheduled to commence . DeVito returned to the subject in February 2013 , saying he was looking for another young actress to star in the title role and scouting movie locations in Ireland . Shooting was supposed to start in July 2014 .
