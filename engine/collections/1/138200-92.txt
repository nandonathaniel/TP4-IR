A collider is a type of a particle accelerator with two directed beams of particles . In particle physics , colliders are used as a research tool : they accelerate particles to relatively high kinetic energies and let them impact other particles . Analysis of the byproducts of these collisions gives scientists good evidence of the structure of the subatomic world and the laws of nature governing it . Many of these byproducts are produced only by high - energy collisions , and they decay after very short periods of time . Thus many of them are hard or nearly impossible to study in other ways .
