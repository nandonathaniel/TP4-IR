French foreign minister the Comte de Vergennes was strongly anti-British , and he sought a casus belli to go to war with and weaken their perennial foe following the conquest of Canada in 1763 . The French had covertly supplied the Americans through neutral Dutch ports since the onset of the war , proving invaluable throughout the Saratoga campaign . The French public favored war , though Vergennes and King Louis XVI were hesitant , owing to the military and financial risk . The American victory at Saratoga convinced the French that supporting the Patriots was worthwhile , but doing so also brought major concerns . The King was concerned that Britain 's concessions would be accepted , and that she would then reconcile with the Colonies to strike at French and Spanish possessions in the Caribbean . To prevent this , France formally recognized the United States on February 6 , 1778 and followed with a military alliance . France aimed to expel Britain from the Newfoundland fishery , end restrictions on Dunkirk sovereignty , regain free trade in India , recover Senegal and Dominica , and restore the Treaty of Utrecht provisions pertaining to Anglo - French trade .
