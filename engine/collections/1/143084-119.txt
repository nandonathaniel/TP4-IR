Rupert withdrew to Shrewsbury , where a council - of - war discussed two courses of action : whether to advance towards Essex 's new position near Worcester , or to march along the now opened road towards London . The Council decided to take the London route , but not to avoid a battle , for the Royalist generals wanted to fight Essex before he grew too strong , and the temper of both sides made it impossible to postpone the decision . In the Earl of Clarendon 's words : `` it was considered more counsellable to march towards London , it being morally sure that the earl of Essex would put himself in their way '' . Accordingly , the army left Shrewsbury on 12 October , gaining two days ' start on the enemy , and moved south - east . This had the desired effect , as it forced Essex to move to intercept them .
