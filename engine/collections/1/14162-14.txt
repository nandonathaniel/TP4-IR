With increases in both human and animal populations in the Indian arid zone , the demand for grain , fodder , and fuel wood is increasing . Agricultural production in this region is low due to the low and uneven distribution of rainfall ( 100 -- 400 mm yr `` 1 ) and the low availability of essential mineral nutrients . These demands can be met only by increasing production levels of these Aridisols through adoption of farming technologies that improve physical properties as well as biological processes of these soils . Alternate farming systems are being sought for higher sustainable crop production at low input levels and to protect the soils from further degradation .
