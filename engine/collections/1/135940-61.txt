Following the success of the Ordos walls , Yu Zijun proposed construction of a further wall that would extend from the Yellow River bend in the Ordos to the Sihaiye Pass ( 四海 冶 口 ; in present - day Yanqing County ) near the capital Beijing , running a distance of more than 1300 li ( about 700 kilometres ( 430 mi ) ) . The project received approval in 1485 , but Yu 's political enemies harped on the cost overruns and forced Yu to scrap the project and retire the same year . For more than 50 years after Yu 's resignation , political struggle prevented major wall constructions on a scale comparable to Yu 's Ordos project .
