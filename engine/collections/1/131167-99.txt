Established uitlanders , including the mining magnates , wanted political , social , and economic control over their lives . These rights included a stable constitution , a fair franchise law , an independent judiciary and a better educational system . The Boers , for their part , recognised that the more concessions they made to the uitlanders the greater the likelihood -- with approximately 30,000 white male Boer voters and potentially 60,000 white male uitlanders -- that their independent control of the Transvaal would be lost and the territory absorbed into the British Empire . The uitlanders resented the taxes levied by the Transvaal government , particularly when this money was not spent on Johannesburg or uitlander interests , but diverted to projects elsewhere in the Transvaal . For example , as the gold - bearing ore sloped away from the outcrop underground to the south , more and more blasting was necessary for extraction , and mines consumed vast quantities of explosives . A box of dynamite costing five pounds included five shillings tax . Not only was this tax perceived as exorbitant , but British interests were offended when President Paul Kruger gave monopoly rights for the manufacture of the explosive to a non-British branch of the Nobel company , which infuriated Britain . The so - called `` dynamite monopoly '' became a casus belli .
