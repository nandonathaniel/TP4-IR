The bow was an important weapon for both hunting and warfare from prehistoric times until the widespread use of gunpowder in the 16th century . Organised warfare with bows ended in the mid 17th century in Europe , but it persisted into the early 19th century in Eastern cultures and in hunting and tribal warfare in the New World . In the Canadian Arctic bows were made until the end of the 20th century for hunting caribou , for instance at Igloolik . The bow has more recently been used as a weapon of tribal warfare in some parts of Sub-Saharan Africa ; an example was documented in 2009 in Kenya when Kisii people and Kalenjin people clashed , resulting in four deaths .
