Baseboards / skirting boards generally have typical variations depending on the country . For example , in China the baseboards are usually very low in height , are made of plastic or redwood , and have a very simple or unprofiled design . In contrast , in the UK there are a vast number of profiles available . These profiles are frequently named after the period when they were developed , such as Victorian or Edwardian .
