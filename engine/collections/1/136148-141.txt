From 1801 to 1802 , and again from 1802 to 1872 , the state of North Carolina was subdivided into the United States District Courts for the Districts of Albemarle , Cape Fear , and Pamptico . These courts were extinguished when the state was reorganized into the United States District Courts for the Eastern and Western Districts of North Carolina .
