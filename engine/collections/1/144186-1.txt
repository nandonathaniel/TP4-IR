Modern legal codes use the term peace officer ( or in some jurisdictions , law enforcement officer ) to include every person vested by the legislating state with law enforcement authority -- traditionally , anyone `` sworn , badged , and armable '' who can arrest , or refer such arrest for a criminal prosecution . Hence , city police officers , county sheriffs ' deputies , and state troopers are usually vested with the same authority within a given jurisdiction . Contract security officers may enforce certain laws and administrative regulations , which may include detainment or apprehension authority , including arresting . Peace officers may also be able to perform all duties that a law enforcement officer is tasked with , but may or may not be armed with a weapon .
