It has been argued that the size and technology of these revisions was so great that the credit for its design should go to Barlow and Hawkshaw . The towers remained in rough stone , rather than being finished in the Egyptian style . Work on the bridge was restarted in 1862 . Initially a temporary bridge was created by pulling ropes across the gorge and making a footway of wire ropes with wood planks held together with iron hoops . This was used by the workers to move a `` traveller '' , consisting of a light frame on wheels , to transport each link individually , which would eventually make up the chains supporting the bridge . The chains are anchored in tapering tunnels , 25 metres ( 82 ft ) long , on either side of the bridge and plugs of Staffordshire blue brick infilled to prevent the chains being pulled out of the narrower tunnel mouth . After completion of the chains , vertical suspension rods were hung from the links in the chains and large girders hung from these . The girders on either side then support the deck , which is 3 feet ( 0.91 m ) higher at the Clifton end than at Leigh Woods so that it gives the impression of being horizontal . The strength of the structure was tested by spreading 500 tons of stone over the bridge . This caused it to sag by 7 inches ( 180 mm ) , but within the expected tolerances . During this time a tunnel was driven through the rocks on the Leigh Woods side beneath the bridge to carry the Bristol Port Railway to Avonmouth . The construction work was completed in 1864 -- 111 years after a bridge at the site was first planned .
