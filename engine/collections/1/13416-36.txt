With no defenses left , Alice and the crew decide to get to the Hive entrance , located at the bottom of the nuclear bomb crater which destroyed the city . However , Wesker , having taken control of the Hive , releases mutated guard dogs , killing Christian and one of the two survivors who joined the group earlier . Upon arriving at the Hive , the Red Queen appears again to Alice and explains the reason of her betrayal . She revealed that a video was uploaded to her program which contained the recording of Umbrella 's head executives , including Isaacs , having a meeting regarding the world , formulating a plan to release the T - virus on purpose in order to cleanse the world of man - made war and disease and environmental catastrophe , save the rich and powerful with cryogenic capsules hidden in the Hive , and later rebuild the world in their image . The Red Queen , although programmed to never hurt an Umbrella employee , was also programmed to value human life , which is why she enlists Alice 's help in order to stop Isaacs . The Red Queen also warns Alice that someone in her group is a spy for Umbrella .
