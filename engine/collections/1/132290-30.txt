The boys decide to appoint a chief . The vote goes to Ralph , not Jack . Initially , Ralph is able to steer the boys ( all of whom are aged between about six and fourteen ) towards a reasonably civilized and co-operative society . Only the boy holding the conch is allowed to speak in turns during meetings or `` assemblies '' . The choir boys make wooden spears , creating the appearance that they are warriors within the group . Crucially , Jack has a knife , capable of killing an animal .
