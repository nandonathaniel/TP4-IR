The term mainly refers to a mix of lithium and aluminosilicates that yields an array of materials with interesting thermomechanical properties . The most commercially important of these have the distinction of being impervious to thermal shock . Thus , glass - ceramics have become extremely useful for countertop cooking . The negative thermal expansion coefficient ( CTE ) of the crystalline ceramic phase can be balanced with the positive CTE of the glassy phase . At a certain point ( ~ 70 % crystalline ) the glass - ceramic has a net CTE near zero . This type of glass - ceramic exhibits excellent mechanical properties and can sustain repeated and quick temperature changes up to 1000 Â° C .
