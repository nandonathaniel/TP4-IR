It contains a door that , depending on the knocking pattern on its panels , can be opened into any universe . It also creates a temporary parallel universe and is able to shift a character between the parallel and the original . As the parallel universe collapses , darkness falls , and a character perishes in the void after uttering the words , `` O time thy pyramids , '' which are contained on the second - to - last page of a book in the Library of Babel .
