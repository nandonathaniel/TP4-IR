After the film 's release , there was controversy over whether several alien characters reflect racial stereotypes . For example , the oafish , slow - witted Jar Jar Binks had long droopy ears reminiscent of dreadlocks and spoke with what many perceived as a Caribbean patois reminiscent of Jamaican Creole . The greedy and corrupt Neimoidians of the Trade Federation spoke with East Asian accents and the unprincipled trader Watto has been interpreted as a Jewish stereotype reminiscent of Charles Dickens ' character Fagin . Lucas has denied all of these implications , instead criticizing the American media for using opinions from the Internet as a reliable source for news stories . Lucas added that it reflected more the racism of the commenters than it does the movie ; however , animator Rob Coleman said he viewed footage of Alec Guinness as Fagin in Oliver Twist to inspire his animators in the creation of Watto . Drew Grant described Jar Jar Binks as `` ( s ) ervile and cowardly ... a black minstrel - ish stereotype on par with Stepin Fetchit . '' Michael Eric Dyson , professor of African - American studies at Georgetown University , said the entire Gungan people seem oddly suggestive of a primitive African tribe . Dyson said `` The leader of Jar Jar 's tribe is a fat , bumbling buffoon with a rumbling voice , and he seems to be a caricature of a stereotypical African tribal chieftain . ''
