Although the Bencao Tujing was an important pharmaceutical work of the age , Su Song is perhaps better known for his work in horology . His book Xinyi Xiangfayao ( 新 儀 象 法要 ; lit . ' Essentials of a New Method for Mechanizing the Rotation of an Armillary Sphere and a Celestial Globe ' ) documented the intricate mechanics of his astronomical clock tower in Kaifeng . This included the use of an escapement mechanism and world 's first known chain drive to power the rotating armillary sphere crowning the top as well as the 133 clock jack figurines positioned on a rotating wheel that sounded the hours by banging drums , clashing gongs , striking bells , and holding plaques with special announcements appearing from open - and - close shutter windows . While it had been Zhang Heng who applied the first motive power to the armillary sphere via hydraulics in 125 CE , it was Yi Xing ( 683 -- 727 ) in 725 CE who first applied an escapement mechanism to a water - powered celestial globe and striking clock . The early Song Dynasty horologist Zhang Sixun ( fl . late 10th century ) employed liquid mercury in his astronomical clock because there were complaints that water would freeze too easily in the clepsydra tanks during winter .
