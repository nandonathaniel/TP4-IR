In 1918 Hardy and Ramanujan studied the partition function P ( n ) extensively . They gave a non-convergent asymptotic series that permits exact computation of the number of partitions of an integer . Hans Rademacher , in 1937 , was able to refine their formula to find an exact convergent series solution to this problem . Ramanujan and Hardy 's work in this area gave rise to a powerful new method for finding asymptotic formulae called the circle method .
