Section 1 of the Twenty - fifth Amendment states that the vice president becomes president upon the removal from office , death , or resignation of the preceding president . The Presidential Succession Act of 1947 provides that if the offices of president and vice president are each either vacant or are held by a disabled person , the next officer in the presidential line of succession , the Speaker of the House , becomes acting president . The line then extends to the President pro tempore of the Senate , followed by every member of the Cabinet . The constitutionality of having congressional officials in the line of succession has been questioned . A person must fulfill all eligibility requirements of the office of president to be eligible to become acting president ; ineligible individuals are skipped .
