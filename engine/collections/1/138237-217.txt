According to the now defunct Department for Constitutional Affairs , the Prime Minister is made a Privy Counsellor as a result of taking office and should be addressed by the official title prefixed by `` The Right Honourable '' and not by a personal name . Although this form of address is employed on formal occasions , it is rarely used by the media . As `` Prime Minister '' is a position , not a title , the incumbent should be referred to as `` the Prime Minister '' . The title `` Prime Minister '' ( e.g. `` Prime Minister James Smith '' ) is technically incorrect but is sometimes used erroneously outside the United Kingdom , and has more recently become acceptable within it . Within the UK , the expression `` Prime Minister Smith '' is never used , although it , too , is sometimes used by foreign dignitaries and news sources .
