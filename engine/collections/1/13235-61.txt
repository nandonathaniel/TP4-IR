In 1999 , Harry Connick , Jr. invented a system and method for coordinating music display among players in an orchestra . Connick 's invention is a device with a computer screen which is used to show the sheet music for the musicians in an orchestra instead of the more commonly used paper . Connick uses this system when touring with his big band , for instance . In the classical music world , some string quartet groups use computer screen - based parts . There are several advantages to computer - based parts . Since the score is on a computer screen , the user can adjust the contrast , brightness and even the size of the notes , to make reading easier . As well , some systems will do `` page turns '' using a foot pedal , which means that the performer does not have to miss playing music during a page turn , as often occurs with paper parts .
