Sumati Shatakam , which is a neeti ( `` moral '' ) , is one of the most famous Telugu Shatakams . Shatakam is composed of more than a 100 padyalu ( poems ) . According to many literary critics Sumati Shatakam was composed by Baddena Bhupaludu ( Telugu : బద్దెన భూపాల ) ( CE 1220 -- 1280 ) . He was also known as Bhadra Bhupala . He was a Chola prince and a vassal under the Kakatiya empress Rani Rudrama Devi , and a pupil of Tikkana . If we assume that the Sumati Shatakam was indeed written by Baddena , it would rank as one of the earliest Shatakams in Telugu along with the Vrushadhipa Satakam of Palkuriki Somanatha and the Sarveswara Satakam of Yathavakkula Annamayya . The Sumatee Shatakam is also one of the earliest Telugu works to be translated into a European language , as C.P. Brown rendered it in English in the 1840s .
