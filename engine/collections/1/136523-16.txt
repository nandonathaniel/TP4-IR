The Mongol army administered the Yam . The Yam stretched across Mongol territory from Eastern Europe to the Pacific Ocean . The routes were well organised , funded , maintained , and administrated by the Mongols .

As a result of the relatively lucid communication and ease of movement , the Mongols were able to govern their vast empire effectively , thus ensuring political and economic stability .
