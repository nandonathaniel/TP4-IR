No , I do n't think there was really any other option . There 's a lot of nature versus nurture going on in this episode to look at . As much as it broke Carol 's heart to have to do this and to realize this had to be done . They were walking toward the flowers in that scene and Lizzie says , `` You 're mad at me and I 'm sorry . '' You 'd think she 'd be sorry for stabbing her sister to death , but instead she 's sorry for pointing gun at her , so she just does n't get it . It 's not a world that 's safe for anyone . The ability to fight is n't a one - size fits all ; everybody is different . Thematically , there 's a lot said about change . Something I got out of this episode for Carol , too , is that you have to change . The world will change you -- you have to adapt or die . It 's about hanging on to that part of yourself : You can change but do n't lose yourself . That 's what was happening to Carol -- her mindset -- she was so hell - bent on protecting these children that she lost a bit of something , and that was her nurturing aspect . She was missing a lot of stuff because her eyes were so set on survival .
