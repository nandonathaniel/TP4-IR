Disney has been accused of anti-semitism , although none of his employees‍ -- ‌including the animator Art Babbitt , who disliked Disney intensely‍ -- ‌ever accused him of making anti-semitic slurs or taunts . The Walt Disney Family Museum acknowledges that ethnic stereotypes common to films of the 1930s were included in some early cartoons . Disney donated regularly to Jewish charities , he was named `` 1955 Man of the Year '' by the B'nai B'rith chapter in Beverly Hills , and his studio employed a number of Jews , some of whom were in influential positions . Gabler , the first writer to gain unrestricted access to the Disney archives , concludes that the available evidence does not support accusations of anti-semitism and that Disney was `` not ( anti-semitic ) in the conventional sense that we think of someone as being an anti-Semite '' . Gabler concludes that `` though Walt himself , in my estimation , was not anti-Semitic , nevertheless , he willingly allied himself with people who were anti-Semitic ( meaning the MPAPAI ) , and that reputation stuck . He was never really able to expunge it throughout his life '' . Disney distanced himself from the Motion Picture Alliance in the 1950s .
