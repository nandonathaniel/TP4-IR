In the Pride Lands of Africa , a lion rules over the animal kingdom from Pride Rock . King Mufasa 's newborn son , Simba , is presented to the assembled animals by Rafiki , a mandrill who serves as shaman and advisor . Mufasa shows young Simba the Pride Lands and explains to him the responsibilities of kingship and the `` circle of life '' which connects all living things . Mufasa 's younger brother , Scar , covets the throne and plots to eliminate Mufasa and Simba so he may become king . He tricks Simba and his best friend Nala -- to whom Simba is betrothed -- into exploring a forbidden elephants ' graveyard , where they are attacked by three spotted hyenas who are in league with Scar . Mufasa is alerted to the danger by his majordomo , the hornbill Zazu , and rescues the cubs . Though angry with Simba , Mufasa forgives him and explains that the great kings of the past watch over them from the night sky , from which he will one day watch over Simba .
