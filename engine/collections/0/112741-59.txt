In June 2011 , Walt Disney Studios set a July 26 , 2013 , release date for the Thor sequel with Chris Hemsworth reprising his role as the title hero . It was also reported that Branagh would not be returning as director but would likely be involved in a producing capacity . The Los Angeles Times cited the long commitment necessary for a special effects - heavy epic and the pressure to start the script process right away as reasons for Branagh 's departure , although he was initially enthused by the chance to direct the sequel . Branagh noted , `` It was a long time ( making the first film ) and they were way too quick for me to get straight back into another , ( but ) it was a pleasurable experience and a film I 'm very proud of . '' The following day , Marvel formally hired Payne , one of the credited writers of the first film , to script the sequel . In August , Brian Kirk entered early negotiations to direct the Thor sequel . The film would have marked Kirk 's first time directing a big - budget motion picture , after having directed television series for HBO , Showtime and the BBC , including Game of Thrones .
