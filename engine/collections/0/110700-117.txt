In the early part of the twentieth century , the American Association for the Advancement of Atheism ( 4A ) opposed the celebration of Thanksgiving Day , offering an alternative observance called Blamegiving Day , which was in their eyes , `` a protest against Divine negligence , to be observed each year on Thanksgiving Day , on the assumption , for the day only , that God exists . '' Citing their view of the separation of church and state , some atheists in recent times have particularly criticized the annual recitation of Thanksgiving proclamations by the President of the United States , because these proclamations often revolve around the theme of giving thanks to God .
