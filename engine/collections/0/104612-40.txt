Earlier , in The Canon of Medicine ( 1025 ) , Avicenna was also the first to describe what is essentially methods of agreement , difference and concomitant variation which are critical to inductive logic and the scientific method . However , unlike his contemporary al - Biruni 's scientific method , in which `` universals came out of practical , experimental work '' and `` theories are formulated after discoveries '' , Avicenna developed a scientific procedure in which `` general and universal questions came first and led to experimental work . '' Due to the differences between their methods , al - Biruni referred to himself as a mathematical scientist and to Avicenna as a philosopher , during a debate between the two scholars .
