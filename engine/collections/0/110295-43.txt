The majority of adult professional players shoot free throws in the overhand style , despite both theoretical and practical demonstrations that the underhand style ( aka `` granny - style '' ) usually produces better average results . Famously , in the NBA , Rick Barry retired in 1980 while ranked first in NBA history at the time with his 0.900 free throw percentage . There were only a few professional players who have utilized this technique , while the vast majority of them resisted adopting the technique for the fear of ridicule or for other similar reasons unrelated to performance .
