For its release in Europe , Kubrick cut about 25 minutes from the film . The excised scenes included a longer meeting between Jack and Watson at the hotel , Danny being attended by a doctor ( Anne Jackson ) including references to Tony and how Danny was once injured by Jack in a drunken rage , more footage of Hallorann 's attempts to get to the hotel during the snowstorm including a sequence with a garage attendant ( Tony Burton ) , extended dialogue scenes at the hotel , and a scene where Wendy discovers a group of skeletons in the hotel lobby during the climax . Jackson and Burton are credited in the European print , despite their scenes being excised from the movie . According to Harlan , Kubrick decided to cut some sequences because the film was `` not very well received '' , and after Warner Bros. complained about its ambiguity and length .
