Combat Controller training , which is nearly two years long , is among the most rigorous in the US military . The CCT pipeline has a wash out rate upwards of 90 -- 95 % , mostly due to self - eliminations , injuries sustained during training , and academic failures . The Air Force is working to lower the washout rate through proper education , testing and rigorous pre-pipeline training .
