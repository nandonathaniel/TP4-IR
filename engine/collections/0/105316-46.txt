Although the law of the Roman Empire is not used today , modern law in many jurisdictions is based on principles of law used and developed during the Roman Empire . Some of the same Latin terminology is still used today . The general structure of jurisprudence used today , in many jurisdictions , is the same ( trial with a judge , plaintiff , and defendant ) as that established during the Roman Empire .
