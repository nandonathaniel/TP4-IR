On June 4 , 1972 , during the last day of the 9 - day Transpo ' 72 Air Show , the U.S. Air Force Thunderbirds experienced their first fatal crash at an air show . Major Joe Howard flying Thunderbird 3 was killed when his F - 4E - 32 - MC Phantom II , 66 - 0321 , lost power during a vertical maneuver . The pilot broke out of formation just after he completed a wedge roll and was ascending at around 2,500 feet AGL . The aircraft staggered and descended in a flat attitude with little forward speed . Although Major Howard ejected as the aircraft fell back to earth from about 1,500 feet ( 460 m ) tail first , and descended under a good canopy , winds blew him into the fireball ascending from the blazing crash site . The parachute melted and the pilot plummeted 200 feet , sustaining fatal injuries .
