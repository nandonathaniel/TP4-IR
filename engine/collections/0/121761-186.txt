Wilman said that lawyers for Amazon were very mindful of any perceived similarities in segments to Top Gear , requiring changes to the format and regular segments . Named elements from Top Gear like The Star in a Reasonably Priced Car , the Cool Wall , and the Stig could not be used at all , but they also had to clear other legal concerns . For example , the lawyers said they could test cars on a test track , but they could not post the times using hand - written signs as they had done on Top Gear ; instead , they used a digital leaderboard . Wilman said that some of the lawyers ' concerns `` got funnier and funnier '' , such as whether May could say `` cock '' , or whether during one of their exotic roadtrips , if they could stop and admire the scenery by saying `` it 's beautiful '' as they frequently did on Top Gear .
