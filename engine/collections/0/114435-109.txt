As has been mentioned previously , many rock radio stations in the late 1970s adopted anti-disco stances , and this , too , was reflected in the way some affiliates edited AT40 . For example , one 1979 show featured a story about disco saving New York ; again , the show was structured so that anti-disco stations could edit the story out of the show . ( Notably , Kasem ended the monologue with the prediction that `` disco is here to stay , '' which was proven false in short order , as disco rapidly fell out of fashion by 1980 . )
