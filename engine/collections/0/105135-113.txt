With the official series order , Fox released a brief teaser for the series which / Film 's Jacob Hall described as `` bland '' , particularly `` arriving in the wake of Logan , Deadpool , and FX 's Legion , each of which proved that there 's plenty of gas in the tank for Mutantkind , provided that everyone involved is willing to really shake things up and go for broke . '' This was followed a week later by a full length trailer for Fox 's May 2017 Upfront presentation , which Hoai - Tran Bui , also of / Film , said `` looks like a Singer take on Heroes . '' Bui added , `` The Gifted is a bit more by - the - numbers ( than Legion ) , airing on a primetime network , spearheaded by X-Men movie director Singer , and clearly connected to the movie universe ... Whether that connection helps or hinders the series is yet to be seen -- as is Singer 's involvement , whose X-Men films become increasingly nonsensical and ... bad . '' The trailer had been viewed over 31 million times within a day of its release , including over 11 million views on YouTube . This was compared to the performance of the first trailer for This Is Us the year before , which went on to be a critical and commercial success . Also for Fox 's Upfront , `` government agents '' from the series ' Sentinel Services agency were running a mobile `` Mutant Testing Center '' in New York City on May 15 , offering genetic tests to see if participants have the `` mutant gene '' . The test results `` about who they are and where they came from '' would be mailed to the participants in about a month . Footage from the pilot was screened at a 2017 San Diego Comic - Con panel featuring cast and crew members , and the beginning of the second episode was debuted at a similar panel for the show at New York Comic Con later that year .
