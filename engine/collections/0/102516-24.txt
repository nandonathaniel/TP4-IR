Despite the concerns which arose among the public after the Three Mile Island incident , the accident highlights the success of the reactor 's safety systems . The radioactivity released as a result of the accident was almost entirely confined within the reinforced concrete containment structure . These containment structures , found at all nuclear power plants , were designed to successfully trap radioactive material in the event of a melt down or accident . At Three Mile Island , the containment structures operated exactly as it was designed to do , emerging successful in containing any radioactive energy . The low levels of radioactivity released post incident is considered harmless , resulting in zero injuries and deaths of residents living in proximity to the plant .
