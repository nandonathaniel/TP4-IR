In a 2004 article for the Oregon Historical Quarterly , Professor Thomas Love and Smithsonian linguist Ives Goddard argue that Rogers chose the word based on exposure to either of the Algonquian words wauregan and olighin , both meaning `` good and beautiful ( river ) , '' but in Rogers ' day referring to the Ohio River . According to their theory , Rogers was inspired by a reference to a `` Belle Rivière , '' or `` Beautiful River '' ( which could have arguably stood for the river in question ) in Antoine - Simon Le Page du Pratz 's Histoire de la Louisiane , published in 1758 . Le Page du Pratz also referred to an alleged Indian origin for this name but did not supply an Indian word for it . Goddard and Love then surmise that Rogers substituted his bastardization of the Mohegan pidgin word wauregan for Le Page du Pratz 's `` translation '' Belle Rivière .
