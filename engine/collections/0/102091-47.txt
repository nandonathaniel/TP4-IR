After the newspaper revelations on April 23 , the U.S. Senate inquiry subpoenaed Gill , as well as Captain Lord , and others from Californian . During his testimony , Gill repeated his claims . Lord 's testimony was conflicting and changing . For example , he detailed three totally different ice conditions . He admitted knowing about the rockets ( after telling Boston newspapers that his ship had not seen any rockets ) but insisted that they were not distress rockets , and they were not fired from Titanic but a small steamship , the so - called `` third ship '' of the night . Yet the testimony of Captain J. Knapp , U.S. Navy , and a part of the Navy Hydrographer 's Office , made clear that Titanic and Californian were in sight of each other , and no third vessel had been in the area .
