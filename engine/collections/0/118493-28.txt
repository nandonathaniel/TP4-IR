The tall , vertically strung upright grand was arranged like a grand set on end , with the soundboard and bridges above the keys , and tuning pins below them . The term was later revived by many manufacturers for advertising purposes . `` Giraffe pianos '' , `` pyramid pianos '' and `` lyre pianos '' were arranged in a somewhat similar fashion , using evocatively shaped cases . The very tall cabinet piano was introduced about 1805 and was built through the 1840s . It had strings arranged vertically on a continuous frame with bridges extended nearly to the floor , behind the keyboard and very large sticker action . The short cottage upright or pianino with vertical stringing , made popular by Robert Wornum around 1815 , was built into the 20th century . They are informally called birdcage pianos because of their prominent damper mechanism . The oblique upright , popularized in France by Roller & Blanchet during the late 1820s , was diagonally strung throughout its compass . The tiny spinet upright was manufactured from the mid-1930s until recent times . The low position of the hammers required the use of a `` drop action '' to preserve a reasonable keyboard height . Modern upright and grand pianos attained their present , 2000 - era forms by the end of the 19th century . While improvements have been made in manufacturing processes , and many individual details of the instrument continue to receive attention , and a small number of acoustic pianos are produced with MIDI recording and sound module - triggering capabilities , the 19th century was the era of the most dramatic innovations and modifications of the instrument .
