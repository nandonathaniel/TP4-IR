Sterilized intervention is a policy that attempts to influence the exchange rate without changing the monetary base . The procedure is a combination of two transactions . First , the central bank conducts a nonsterilized intervention by buying ( selling ) foreign currency bonds using domestic currency that it issues . Then the central bank `` sterilizes '' the effects on the monetary base by selling ( buying ) a corresponding quantity of domestic - currency - denominated bonds to soak up the initial increase ( decrease ) of the domestic currency . The net effect of the two operations is the same as a swap of domestic - currency bonds for foreign - currency bonds with no change in the money supply . With sterilization , any purchase of foreign exchange is accompanied by an equal - valued sale of domestic bonds , and vice versa .
