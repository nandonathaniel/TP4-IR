In 1838 with the abolition of slavery at its onset , the British were in the process of transporting a million Indians out of India and into the Caribbean to take the place of the African slaves in indenture - ship . For women specifically , looking for what they believed to be a better life in the colonies , were sought after and recruited at a much higher rate than men due to the high population of men already in the colonies . However women were required to prove their status as a single and eligible to emigrate , as married women could not leave without their husbands . Many women seeking escape from abusive relationships were willing to take that chance . The Indian Immigration Act of 1883 was passed to prevent women from attempting to exit India as widowed or single in order to escape . Arrival in the colonies brought unexpected conditions of poverty , homelessness , and little to no food as the high numbers of emigrants overwhelmed the small villages and flooded the labor market . Many were forced into signing labor contracts that exposed them to the hard field labor on the plantation . Additionally , on arrival to the plantation , single women were ' assigned ' a man as they were not allowed to live alone . The subtle difference between slavery and indenture - ship is best seen here as women were still subjected to the control of the plantation owners as well as their newly assigned ' partner ' . Their status was closer to chattel property than human being .
