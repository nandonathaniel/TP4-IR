Chosen to be the next Author by the Sorcerer and his Apprentice in 1966 , Isaac begins recording stories . At some point after this , he travels to a world based on 1920s England looking for a good story . Using his Magic Quill , he can write anything into existence as long as it is recorded using a bottle of Magic Ink . Falling in love with a charming girl named Cruella , he explains his ability to her and proves it by using the quill to give her a necklace and earrings . Issac asks her to run away with him . As Cruella still fears her mother , Isaac gifts her the ability to control animals . Insisting that she confront her mother one last time , Cruella decides to go home as Isaac waits for her return . Sometime during this , Cruella secretly steals Isaac 's Magic Quill ( something he discovers only after Cruella 's mother Madeline reveals her daughter 's murderous persona to him ) . After Cruella kills Madeline , Isaac retrieves his Magic Quill and managing to dip it into the ink bottle . Before all the ink spills on Cruella ( whose hair turns black and white from it ) , she corners him at gunpoint only for a fast - acting Isaac writes on paper that she can never kill again . Sometime after this incident , Isaac abuses his role as Author by manipulating the Apprentice into infusing Maleficent 's child with darkness and banishing the baby to another realm . While Isaac is in the midst of writing in a storybook , the Apprentice confronts him about his meddling to which the Author casually remarks that it made for a better story . Deeming him corrupt and unworthy of being an Author , the Apprentice formally asks Isaac to forfeit the Magic Quill before banishing him into the book .
