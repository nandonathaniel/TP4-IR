The ideas of the 1960s began to influence horror films , as the youth involved in the counterculture began exploring the medium . Wes Craven 's The Hills Have Eyes ( 1977 ) and The Last House on the Left ( 1972 ) along with Tobe Hooper 's The Texas Chain Saw Massacre ( 1974 ) ( based on the Ed Gein case ) recalled the Vietnam War ; while George A. Romero satirized the consumer society in his zombie sequel , Dawn of the Dead ( 1978 ) . Meanwhile , the subgenre of comedy horror re-emerged in the cinema with The Abominable Dr. Phibes ( 1971 ) , Young Frankenstein ( 1974 ) , The Rocky Horror Picture Show ( 1975 ) , and An American Werewolf in London ( 1981 ) among others .
