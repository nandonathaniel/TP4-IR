The national doctors association is called the Canadian Medical Association ; it describes its mission as `` To serve and unite the physicians of Canada and be the national advocate , in partnership with the people of Canada , for the highest standards of health and health care . '' Because health care is deemed to be under provincial / territorial jurisdiction , negotiations on behalf of physicians are conducted by provincial associations such as the Ontario Medical Association . The views of Canadian doctors have been mixed , particularly in their support for allowing parallel private financing . The history of Canadian physicians in the development of Medicare has been described by C. David Naylor . Since the passage of the 1984 Canada Health Act , the CMA itself has been a strong advocate of maintaining a strong publicly funded system , including lobbying the federal government to increase funding , and being a founding member of ( and active participant in ) the Health Action Lobby ( HEAL ) .
