In the late imperial period ( 1368 -- 1911 ) , comprising the Ming and Qing dynasties , taxation was low , and the economy and population grew significantly , though without substantial increases in productivity . Chinese goods such as silk , tea and ceramics were in great demand in Europe , leading to an inflow of silver , expanding the money supply and facilitating the growth of competitive and stable markets . By the end of the 18th century , population density levels exceeded those in Europe . China had more large cities but far fewer small ones than in contemporary Europe . The traditional view is that the Great Divergence between China and Europe had begun by 1750 , before the Industrial Revolution . Revisionist scholarship , however , estimates that the Great Divergence did not begin until the 19th century , during the Industrial Revolution .
