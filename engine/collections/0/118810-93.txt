Ring artifact Probably the most common mechanical artifact , the image of one or many `` rings '' appears within an image . They are usually caused by the variations in the response from individual elements in a two dimensional X-ray detector due to defect or miscalibration . Ring artefacts can largely be reduced by intensity normalization , also referred to as flat field correction . Remaining rings can be suppressed by a transformation to polar space , where they become linear stripes . A comparative evaluation of ring artefact reduction on X-ray tomography images showed that the method of Sijbers and Postnov can effectively suppress ring artefacts .
