A membrane transport protein ( or simply transporter ) is a membrane protein involved in the movement of ions , small molecules , or macromolecules , such as another protein , across a biological membrane . Transport proteins are integral transmembrane proteins ; that is they exist permanently within and span the membrane across which they transport substances . The proteins may assist in the movement of substances by facilitated diffusion or active transport . The two main types of proteins involved in such transport are broadly categorized as either channels or carriers . The solute carrier s and atypical SLC s are secondary active or facilitative transporters in humans .
