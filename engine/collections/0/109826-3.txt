A well - known case of a spurious relationship can be found in the time - series literature , where a spurious regression is a regression that provides misleading statistical evidence of a linear relationship between independent non-stationary variables . In fact , the non-stationarity may be due to the presence of a unit root in both variables . In particular , any two nominal economic variables are likely to be correlated with each other , even when neither has a causal effect on the other , because each equals a real variable times the price level , and the common presence of the price level in the two data series imparts correlation to them .
