The `` Big Four Building '' , built in 1852 , was home to the offices of Collis Huntington , Mark Hopkins , Leland Stanford , and Charles Crocker . The Central Pacific Railroad and Southern Pacific Railroad were founded there . The original building was destroyed in 1963 for the construction of Interstate 5 , but was re-created using original elements in 1965 . It is now a National Historic Landmark . Also of historic interest is the Eagle Theatre ( Sacramento , California ) , a reconstruction of California 's first permanent theatre in its original location .
