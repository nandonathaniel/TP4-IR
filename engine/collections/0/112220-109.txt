Neither House may adjourn , without the consent of the other , for more than three days . Often , a House will hold pro forma sessions every three days ; such sessions are merely held to fulfill the constitutional requirement , and not to conduct business . Furthermore , neither House may meet in any place other than that designated for both Houses ( the Capitol ) , without the consent of the other House .
