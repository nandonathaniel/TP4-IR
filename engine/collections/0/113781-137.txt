Among the important pronouncements of the supreme court post 2000 is the Coelho case I.R. Coelho v. State of Tamil Nadu ( Judgment of 11 January 2007 ) . A unanimous bench of 9 judges reaffirmed the basic structure doctrine . It held that a constitutional amendment which entails violation of any fundamental rights which the Court regards as forming part of the basic structure of the constitution , then the same can be struck down depending upon its impact and consequences . The judgment clearly imposes further limitations on the constituent power of parliament with respect to the principles underlying certain fundamental rights . The judgment in Coelho has in effect restored the decision in Golak Nath regarding non-amendability of the constitution on account of infraction of fundamental rights , contrary to the judgment in the Kesavananda Bharati case .
