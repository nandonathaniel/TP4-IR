Williams is primarily a baseline player , and her game is built around taking immediate control of rallies with her powerful and consistent serve , return of serve , and forceful groundstrokes from both her forehand and backhand swings . Williams 's forehand is considered to be among the most powerful shots in the women 's game , as is her double - handed backhand . Williams strikes her backhand groundstroke using an open stance , and uses the same open stance for her forehand . Williams 's aggressive play , a `` high risk '' style , is balanced in part by her serve , which most say is the greatest in women 's tennis history . She consistently projects great pace and placement with her serves ; in the 2013 Australian Open , she had a peak serve speed of 128.6 mph ( 207.0 km / h ) which is the third fastest all - time among female players ( only Venus 's 129 mph and Sabine Lisicki 's 131 mph recorded speeds are faster ) . What makes her serve even more deadly is her ball placement and her ability to consistently place powerful shots with great accuracy . At the 2012 Championships at Wimbledon , she hit a women 's tournament record of 102 aces , which was more than any of the men hit during the two weeks , a rarity given that aces are more common in the men 's game . Williams also possesses a very solid and powerful overhead . Although many think of Williams as only an offensive player , she also plays a strong defensive game . She has stated that her favorite surface is clay because it gives her extra time to set up her shots .
