In the boreal forests of Canada and Alaska , red - tails are fairly dependent on the snowshoe hare ( Lepus americanus ) , falling somewhere behind the great horned owl and ahead of the northern goshawk in their regional reliance on this food source . The hunting preferences of red - tails who rely on snowshoe hares is variable . In Rochester , Alberta , 52 % of snowshoe hares caught were adults , such prey estimated to average 1,287 g ( 2.837 lb ) , and adults , in some years , were six times more often taken than juvenile hares , which averaged an estimated 560 g ( 1.23 lb ) . 1.9 - 7.1 % of adults in the regional population of Rochester were taken by red - tails , while only 0.3 - 0.8 of juvenile hares were taken by them . Despite their reliance on it , only 4 % ( against 53.4 % of the biomass ) of the food by frequency here was made up of hares . On the other hand , in Kluane , Yukon , juvenile hares were taken roughly 11 times more often than adults , despite the larger size of adults here , averaging 1,406.6 g ( 3.101 lb ) , and that the overall prey base was less diverse at this more northerly clime . In both Rochester and Kluane Lake , the number of snowshoe hares taken was considerably lower than numbers of ground squirrels taken . The differences of average characteristics of snowshoe hares that were hunted may be partially due to habitat ( extent of bog openings to dense forest ) or topography . Another member of the Lagomorpha order has been found in the diet , the much smaller American pika ( Ochotona princeps ) , at 150 g ( 5.3 oz ) , but is not quantitatively common in the foods of the species so far as is known .
