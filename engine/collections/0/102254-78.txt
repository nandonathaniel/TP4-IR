Balraj Puri in his journal article about Jinnah suggests that the Muslim League president , after the 1937 vote , turned to the idea of partition in `` sheer desperation '' . Historian Akbar S. Ahmed suggests that Jinnah abandoned hope of reconciliation with the Congress as he `` rediscover ( ed ) his own Islamic roots , his own sense of identity , of culture and history , which would come increasingly to the fore in the final years of his life '' . Jinnah also increasingly adopted Muslim dress in the late 1930s . In the wake of the 1937 balloting , Jinnah demanded that the question of power sharing be settled on an all - India basis , and that he , as president of the League , be accepted as the sole spokesman for the Muslim community .
