Iturbide 's army was joined by rebel forces from all over Mexico . When the rebels ' victory became certain , the Viceroy resigned . On August 24 , 1821 , representatives of the Spanish crown and Iturbide signed the Treaty of Córdoba , which recognized Mexican independence under the Plan of Iguala . On September 27 , 1821 the Army of the Three Guarantees entered Mexico City , and the following day Iturbide proclaimed the independence of the Mexican Empire , as New Spain was henceforth to be called . The Treaty of Córdoba was not ratified by the Spanish Cortes . Iturbide included a special clause in the treaty that left open the possibility for a criollo monarch to be appointed by a Mexican congress if no suitable member of the European royalty would accept the Mexican crown . Half of the new government employees appointed were Iturbide 's followers .
