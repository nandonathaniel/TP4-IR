The arrival of end Don Hutson from Alabama in 1935 gave Lambeau and the Packers the most - feared and dynamic offensive weapon in the game . Credited with inventing pass patterns , Hutson would lead the league in receptions eight seasons and spur the Packers to NFL championships in 1936 , 1939 and 1944 . An iron man , Hutson played both ways , leading the league in interceptions as a safety in 1940 . Hutson claimed 18 NFL records when he retired in 1945 , many of which still stand . In 1951 , his number 14 was the first to be retired by the Packers , and he was inducted as a charter member of the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1963 .
