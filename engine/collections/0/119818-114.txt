On August 10 , 1920 , the Ottoman Empire signed the Treaty of SÃ¨vres ceding to Greece Thrace , up to the Chatalja lines . More importantly , Turkey renounced to Greece all rights over Imbros and Tenedos , retaining the small territories of Constantinople , the islands of Marmara , and `` a tiny strip of European territory '' . The Straits of Bosporus were placed under an International Commission , as they were now open to all .
