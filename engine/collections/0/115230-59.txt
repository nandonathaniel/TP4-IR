Due to a lockout , the 2011 -- 12 regular season was shortened to 66 games . Not long after the lockout ended , Howard , who was eligible to become a free agent at the end of the season , demanded a trade to the New Jersey Nets , Los Angeles Lakers or Dallas Mavericks . Howard stated that although his preference was to remain in Orlando , he did not feel the Magic organization was doing enough to build a championship contender . He would later meet with Magic officials and agree to back off his trade demands , but stated that he also felt the team needed to make changes to the roster if they wanted to contend for a championship .
