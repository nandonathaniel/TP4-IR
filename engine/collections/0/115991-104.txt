The city of Boston , Massachusetts , has seen several neighborhoods undergo significant periods of urban renewal , specifically during the 1960s to the 1980s . Called `` turbo - gentrification '' by sociologist Alan Wolfe , particular areas of study of the process have been done in South End , Bay Village , and West Cambridge . In Boston 's North End , the removal of the noisy Central Artery elevated highway attracted younger , more affluent new residents , in place of the traditional Italian immigrant culture .
