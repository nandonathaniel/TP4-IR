In Great Britain , MMA failed to capitalise on this momentum and has not seen anywhere near the popularity levels MMA has received in USA . It is hard to pinpoint the main reason why exactly this has happened . The failure of MMA promoters to secure a substantial and locked TV deal until late last year . The reluctance of broadcasting powerhouses BBC and Sky Sports to fully support the sport ? The stereotype of extreme violence that they have been unable to shake off ? All of these are valid reasons why MMA failed to capture the public 's imagination .
