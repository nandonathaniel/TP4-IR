The denominator of an element of Z S ( \ displaystyle \ mathbb ( Z ) _ ( S ) ) contains if reduced to lowest terms only prime factors out of S ( \ displaystyle S ) . This ring of all terminating fractions to base b ( \ displaystyle b ) is dense in the field of rational numbers Q ( \ displaystyle \ mathbb ( Q ) ) . Its completion for the usual ( Archimedean ) metric is the same as for Q ( \ displaystyle \ mathbb ( Q ) ) , namely the real numbers R ( \ displaystyle \ mathbb ( R ) ) . So , if S = ( p ) ( \ displaystyle S = \ ( p \ ) ) then Z ( p ) ( \ displaystyle \ mathbb ( Z ) _ ( \ ( p \ ) ) ) has not to be confused with Z ( p ) ( \ displaystyle \ mathbb ( Z ) _ ( ( p ) ) ) , the discrete valuation ring for the prime p ( \ displaystyle p ) , which is equal to Z T ( \ displaystyle \ mathbb ( Z ) _ ( T ) ) with T = P âˆ– ( p ) ( \ displaystyle T = \ mathbb ( P ) \ setminus \ ( p \ ) ) .
