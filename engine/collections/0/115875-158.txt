Shirayuki is a skilled herbalist living in the country of Tanbarun , with a head of unusual , bright red hair . This makes trouble for her when she is chosen by the snooty Prince Raji Shenazard to be his concubine , and instead of agreeing , flees to the neighbouring city of Clarines by hitching a ride on a carriage . She also cuts her long red hair , still with a ribbon tied to it , on the windowsill . Once in Clarines , she arrives at a house but no one answers the door so she sleeps outside until the next morning . She then meets gains the trust of Zen Wistalia , and his fellow subordinates Mitsuhide Lowen and Kiki Seiran . Zen then offers her shelter in a nearby inn , while making her confess the reason why she escaped . Before he can even express his shock , a basket of apples arrives for Shirayuki , with her hair ribbon tied to the handle . Zen casually eats one and collapses in Kiki and Mitsuhide 's arms . A soldier from Tanbarun then comes and takes Shirayuki away , explaining that the apples were poisoned by Raji , and only he has the antidote , which he will only hand over if Shirayuki marries him and becomes his concubine . Shirayuki is sent to the royal palace of Tanbarun , where she is met by a smug Raji . After bravely agreeing to his proposal in exchange for Zen 's recovery , Zen emerges and rescues her , stating his immunity of poisons . Zen then reveals to Prince Raji that he is the second prince of Clarines , which means that their countries could end up going to war if he announced Prince Raj 's attempt to poison him . Afraid that he would be disgraced , Prince Raji had no choice but to give up on Shirayuki and allow her to return with Zen .
