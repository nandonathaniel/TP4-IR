Together with the Island Co-ordinating Council ( ICC ) the TSRA has been active in implementing community based management strategies . The adoption of a Marine Strategy for the monitoring and management of dugong and turtle populations in the seas around the islands was undertaken in 1999 . In 2006 , successful lobby by the authority and the ICC resulted in the granting of $300,000 from the Federal Government to study the risks of climate change on the six largest Torres Strait Islands . In 2010 , after a nine - year legal battle , the TSRA made a successful native title claim to 40,000 km2 of sea between Cape York Peninsula and Papua New Guinea . This was the largest native title claim in Australia 's history .
