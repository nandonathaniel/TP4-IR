Simulations suggest that , while the disk had a relatively high mass at any given moment , over time a substantial fraction ( several tenths of a percent ) of the mass of Jupiter captured from the Solar nebula was processed through it . However , the disk mass of only 2 % that of Jupiter is required to explain the existing satellites . Thus there may have been several generations of Galilean - mass satellites in Jupiter 's early history . Each generation of moons would have spiraled into Jupiter , due to drag from the disk , with new moons then forming from the new debris captured from the Solar nebula . By the time the present ( possibly fifth ) generation formed , the disk had thinned out to the point that it no longer greatly interfered with the moons ' orbits . The current Galilean moons were still affected , falling into and being partially protected by an orbital resonance which still exists for Io , Europa , and Ganymede . Ganymede 's larger mass means that it would have migrated inward at a faster rate than Europa or Io .
