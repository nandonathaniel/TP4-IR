As a neutral party , the United States argued , it had the right to carry goods anywhere it wanted . The British nevertheless seized American ships carrying goods from the French West Indies . The Federalists favored Britain in the war , and by far most of America 's foreign trade was with Britain ; hence a new treaty was called for . The British agreed to evacuate the western forts , open their West Indies ports to American ships , allow small vessels to trade with the French West Indies , and set up a commission that would adjudicate American claims against Britain for seized ships , and British claims against Americans for debts incurred before 1775 . One possible alternative was war with Britain , a war that America was ill - prepared to fight .
