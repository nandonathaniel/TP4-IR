Performance is the physical expression of music , which occurs when a song is sung or when a piano piece , electric guitar melody , symphony , drum beat or other musical part is played by musicians . In classical music , a musical work is written in music notation by a composer and then it is performed once the composer is satisfied with its structure and instrumentation . However , as it gets performed , the interpretation of a song or piece can evolve and change . In classical music , instrumental performers , singers or conductors may gradually make changes to the phrasing or tempo of a piece . In popular and traditional music , the performers have a lot more freedom to make changes to the form of a song or piece . As such , in popular and traditional music styles , even when a band plays a cover song , they can make changes to it such as adding a guitar solo to or inserting an introduction .
