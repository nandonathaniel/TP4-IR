Longline fishing is a commercial fishing technique . It uses a long line , called the main line , with baited hooks attached at intervals by means of branch lines called snoods ( or gangions ) . A snood is a short length of line , attached to the main line using a clip or swivel , with the hook at the other end . Longlines are classified mainly by where they are placed in the water column . This can be at the surface or at the bottom . Lines can also be set by means of an anchor , or left to drift . Hundreds or even thousands of baited hooks can hang from a single line . Longliners commonly target swordfish , tuna , halibut , sablefish and many other species .
