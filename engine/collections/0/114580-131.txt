Scotland 's reputation for coronary and related diet - based diseases is a result of the wide consumption of fast food since the latter part of the 20th century . Fish and chip shops remain extremely popular , and indeed the battered and fried haggis supper remains a favourite . These have been joined in more recent years by outlets selling pizzas , kebabs , pakoras and other convenience foodstuffs . An extreme example of this style of food is the Munchy box .
