Task : The teams take over a pedicab shift . Protégé Corporation sells prepaid punch cards , modeled after Troy 's phased - sales plan that was the winner on the Trump Ice task . Versacorp sells advertising on the rickshaws that they ride . Amy uses previous contacts made in the game to quickly amass a large amount of advertising commitments . Kwame spends much of the afternoon as a driver but without being able to land a single fare . After one of the ads ( for a restaurant ) is found to have fallen off one of Versacorp 's pedicabs , Nick irritated his teammates by going back to the restaurant owner and returning the full amount paid . When Troy sees Versacorp 's pedicab advertising , he realizes Protégé is sunk and in a rare moment of humility states , `` It was a great idea . I did n't come up with it . '' With Protégé 's victory disappearing into thin air , Heidi begins swearing under her breath at passersby when she is unable to convince them to buy rides .
