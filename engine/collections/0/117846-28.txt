If you write in Wikipedia about yourself , your group , your company , or your pet idea , once the article is created , you have no right to control its content , and no right to delete it outside our normal channels . Content is not deleted just because somebody does n't like it . Any editor may add material to or remove material from the article within the terms of our content policies . If there is anything publicly available on a topic that you would not want included in an article , it will probably find its way there eventually . More than one user has created an article only to find themself presented in a poor light long - term by other editors . If you engage in an edit war in an attempt to obtain a version of your liking you may have your editing access removed , perhaps permanently .
