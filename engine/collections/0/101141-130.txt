Notable incidents and events include the Golden Dragon massacre , a deadly shooting between Chinese gang members in the city 's Chinatown district ; the 101 California Street shootings in 1993 ; and the death of Aaron Williams while in police custody in 1995 . In the latter case , several officers were charged with using excessive force , including Marc Andaya , described as having kicked Williams when he was on the ground . After two years and revelations of numerous complaints and two federal lawsuits against Andaya as an officer with the Oakland Police Department before he moved to San Francisco , in June 1997 Andaya was fired by the San Francisco Police Commission . Van Jones and the Bay City PoliceWatch were credited with organizing and keeping up community pressure against the department on this case .
