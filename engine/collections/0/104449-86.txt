Three Constitutional amendments , known as the Reconstruction Amendments , were adopted . The 13th Amendment abolishing slavery was ratified in 1865 . The 14th Amendment was proposed in 1866 and ratified in 1868 , guaranteeing United States citizenship to all persons born or naturalized in the United States and granting them federal civil rights . The 15th Amendment , proposed in late February 1869 and passed in early February 1870 , decreed that the right to vote could not be denied because of `` race , color , or previous condition of servitude '' . The amendment did not declare the vote an unconditional right ; it prohibited these types of discrimination . States would still determine voter registration and electoral laws . The amendments were directed at ending slavery and providing full citizenship to freedmen . Northern Congressmen believed that providing black men with the right to vote would be the most rapid means of political education and training .
