The Titles of Nobility Amendment ( proposed 1810 ) would , if ratified , strip United States citizenship from any citizen who accepted a title of nobility from a foreign country . When submitted to the states , ratification by thirteen states was required for it to become part of the Constitution ; eleven had done so by early 1812 . However , with the addition of Louisiana into the Union that year ( April 30 , 1812 ) , the ratification threshold rose to fourteen . Thus , when New Hampshire ratified it in December 1812 , the amendment again came within two states of being ratified . No additional states have ratified this amendment since . To become part of the Constitution today , ratification by an additional twenty - six would be required .
