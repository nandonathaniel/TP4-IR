With the club and Sheriff Jarry searching for Gemma , Jax heads to Stockon to confront Juice , who tearfully recounts the events that led to Tara and Eli Roosevelt 's deaths . With that news as well as confirmation that Barosky tipped off August about the guns , Jax calls a forum of several SoA presidents . He explains to them that he killed Jury White because he thought Jury had ratted the club out ; the presidents recommended a Mayhem vote . Jax states his club will be on board and vote accordingly , provided an `` unwritten by - law '' is tossed out . The presidents approve Jax 's request , which was to allow blacks to be patched into the SoA charters .
