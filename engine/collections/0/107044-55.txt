Based on a system of plantation slavery , the social structure of the South was far more stratified and patriarchal than that of the North . In 1850 there were around 350,000 slaveholders in a total free Southern population of about six million . Among slaveholders , the concentration of slave ownership was unevenly distributed . Perhaps around 7 percent of slaveholders owned roughly three - quarters of the slave population . The largest slaveholders , generally owners of large plantations , represented the top stratum of Southern society . They benefited from economies of scale and needed large numbers of slaves on big plantations to produce cotton , a highly profitable labor - intensive crop .
