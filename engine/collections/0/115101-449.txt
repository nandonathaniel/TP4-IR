A short - lived , high - speed passenger / vehicle ferry Spirit of Ontario I built in Australia , nicknamed The Breeze or The Fast Ferry , linked Rochester to Toronto across Lake Ontario . Canadian American Transportation Systems ( CATS ) was the company in charge of the Fast Ferry operations . The Spirit of Ontario I had a delayed arrival on April 29 , 2004 as a result of hitting a pier in New York City on April 5 , 2004 and was finally officially christened on June 16 , 2004 at the Port of Rochester . The Fast Ferry was bought by the City of Rochester in an attempt to save the project . The Fast Ferry operated between June 17 , 2004 , and December 12 , 2005 , and cost the city $42.5 million . The project was initially well received by inhabitants of Rochester . Considerable effort was spent by inhabitants of Rochester to build up the waterfront to embrace the idea as well as to capitalize on potential tourism which was estimated to be an additional 75,000 tourists per month . In the first three months of operation the fast ferry had carried about 140,000 people between Rochester and Toronto . A second Fast Ferry was proposed by CATS on August 27 , 2004 which would have cost an additional $100 Million . There were a number of problems concerning the ship 's engine , the lack of mutual building up of waterfronts in Toronto and the inability of the city to put pressure on the company responsible for the production of the Fast Ferry . This resulted in the failure of the project . It was sold to FÃ¶rde Reederei Seetouristik , a German company , for $30 million .
