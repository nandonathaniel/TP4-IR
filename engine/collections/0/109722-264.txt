Since the equations have four unknowns ( x , y , z , b ) -- the three components of GPS receiver position and the clock bias -- signals from at least four satellites are necessary to attempt solving these equations . They can be solved by algebraic or numerical methods . Existence and uniqueness of GPS solutions are discussed by Abell and Chaffee . When n is greater than 4 this system is overdetermined and a fitting method must be used .
