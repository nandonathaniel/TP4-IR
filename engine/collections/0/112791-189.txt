Bobby Seale , Chairman and Co-Founder of the Black Panther Party for Self - Defense , was outspoken about this issue . His stance was that the oppression of black people was more a result of economic exploitation than anything innately racist . In his book Seize the Time , he states that `` In our view it is a class struggle between the massive proletarian working class and the small , minority ruling class . Working - class people of all colors must unite against the exploitative , oppressive ruling class . So let me emphasize again -- we believe our fight is a class struggle and not a race struggle . ''
