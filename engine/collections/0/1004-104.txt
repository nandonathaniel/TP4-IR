In early March 1971 , approximately ~ 300 Biharis were slaughtered in rioting by Bengali mobs in Chittagong alone . The Government of Pakistan used the `` Bihari massacre ' '' to justify its deployment of the military in East Pakistan on 25 March when it initiated its military crackdown . President Yahya Khan then called on the military , which was overwhelming led by West Pakistanis , to suppress dissent in the East after accepting the resignation of Lieutenant - General Yaqub Ali Khan , the chief of staff of the East - Pakistani military .
