The Pope Marcellus Mass , in short , was not important in its own day and did not help save church polyphony . What is undeniable is that despite any solid evidence of his influence during or after the Council of Trent , no figure is more qualified to represent the cause of polyphony in the Mass than Palestrina . Pope Pius IV upon hearing Palestrina 's music would make Palestrina , by Papal Brief , the model for future generations of Catholic composers of sacred music .
