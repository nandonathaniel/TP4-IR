To explain what is involved , consider a consumer price index computed with reference to 2009 for just one sole consumer who bought her house in 2006 , financing half of this sum by raising a mortgage . The problem is to compare how much interest such a consumer would now be paying with the interest that was paid in 2009 . Since the aim is to compare like with like , that requires an estimate of how much interest would be paid now in the year 2010 on a similar house bought and 50 % mortgage - financed three years ago , in 2007 . It does not require an estimate of how much that identical person is paying now on the actual house she bought in 2006 , even though that is what personally concerns her now .
