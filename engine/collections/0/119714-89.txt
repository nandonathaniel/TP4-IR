On the game 's multiplayer , IGN 's Stapleton reported low player counts in matches , long wait times in lobbies , server disconnection and occasional crashes . `` Because of that , '' he wrote , `` I ca n't strongly recommend ... the multiplayer experience alone '' . VideoGamer.com found online character progression streamlined by comparison with the original version . According to them , the `` grind of just doing PvP until co-op Jobs arrive with regularity '' was lost , and newcomers would likely find multiplayer enjoyable and balanced . However , they wrote of frequent server disconnection , especially during load screens . GameSpot 's Walton thought that Grand Theft Auto Online `` still suffers from a lack of direction '' for its open - ended and frenetic gameplay , but still is fun . Game Informer 's Reiner reported `` minimal lag or issues in the expanded firefights and races '' .
