The long distance human transport theory was bolstered in 2011 by the discovery of a megalithic bluestone quarry at Craig Rhos - y - felin , near Crymych in Pembrokeshire , which is the most likely place for some of the stones to have been obtained . Other standing stones may well have been small sarsens ( sandstone ) , used later as lintels . The stones , which weighed about two tons , could have been moved by lifting and carrying them on rows of poles and rectangular frameworks of poles , as recorded in China , Japan and India . It is not known whether the stones were taken directly from their quarries to Salisbury Plain or were the result of the removal of a venerated stone circle from Preseli to Salisbury Plain to `` merge two sacred centres into one , to unify two politically separate regions , or to legitimise the ancestral identity of migrants moving from one region to another '' . Each monolith measures around 2 metres ( 6.6 ft ) in height , between 1 and 1.5 m ( 3.3 and 4.9 ft ) wide and around 0.8 metres ( 2.6 ft ) thick . What was to become known as the Altar Stone is almost certainly derived from the Senni Beds , perhaps from 50 miles ( 80 kilometres ) east of Mynydd Preseli in the Brecon Beacons .
