In a similar manner , even photons ( light quanta ) , if trapped in a container space ( as a photon gas or thermal radiation ) , would contribute a mass associated with their energy to the container . Such an extra mass , in theory , could be weighed in the same way as any other type of rest mass . This is true in special relativity theory , even though individually photons have no rest mass . The property that trapped energy in any form adds weighable mass to systems that have no net momentum is one of the characteristic and notable consequences of relativity . It has no counterpart in classical Newtonian physics , in which radiation , light , heat , and kinetic energy never exhibit weighable mass under any circumstances .
