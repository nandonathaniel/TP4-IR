By November 1971 , the war seemed inevitable and the Soviet Union had reportedly warned Pakistan against the war which they termed as `` suicidal course for Pakistan 's unity . '' Throughout November 1971 , there were thousands of people led by conservative Pakistani politicians who marched in Lahore and across Pakistan , calling for Pakistan to Crush India . India responded by starting a massive buildup of Indian army on the western borders and the Indian army waited until December , when the drier ground would make for easier operations and Himalayan passes would be closed by snow , preventing any Chinese intervention . On 23 November , President Yahya Khan declared a state of emergency in all of Pakistan and told his people to prepare for war .
