Other hereditary systems of succession included tanistry , which is semi-elective and gives weight to merit and Agnatic seniority . In some monarchies , such as Saudi Arabia , succession to the throne usually first passes to the monarch 's next eldest brother , and only after that to the monarch 's children ( agnatic seniority ) .
