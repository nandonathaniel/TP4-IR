During the documentary interviews , the band expresses a desire to relive the past , even though many of their memories are humiliating . For example , during a concert at Benton College , where Frank was once a student , Eddie ridicules Frank repeatedly by referring to him as `` Toby Tyler '' . The other Cruisers members share similar stories .
