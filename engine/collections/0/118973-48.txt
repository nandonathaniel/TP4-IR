Tank armour has progressed from the Second World War armour forms , now incorporating not only harder composites , but also reactive armour designed to defeat shaped charges . As a result of this , the main battle tank ( MBT ) conceived in the Cold War era can survive multiple RPG strikes with minimal effect on the crew or the operation of the vehicle . The light tanks that were the last descendants of the light cavalry during the Second World War have almost completely disappeared from the world 's militaries due to increased lethality of the weapons available to the vehicle - mounted infantry .
