After releasing their second cover album in 2007 , Motown : A Journey Through Hitsville USA , which was well received by critics , but failed to produce a successful single , the band announced plans for a new cover album , that features cover versions of songs by `` artists I do n't think people would expect us to cover , '' according to member Shawn Stockman . On October 23 , 2009 , `` I Ca n't Make You Love Me '' was announced as Love 's lead - single . The song was later released on October 27 , 2009 through iTunes store . For the band members , `` We wanted to stay true to our roots , and it 's a very beautiful song . And with our sound , we gave it an R&B twist . It 's always been a favorite of ours , and we hope people will fall in love with it again . ''
