The introduction of midi - chlorians in The Phantom Menace was controversial , with Evan Narcisse of Time writing that the concept ruined Star Wars for him and a generation of fans because `` the mechanisms of the Force became less spiritual and more scientific '' . Film historian Daniel Dinello argues , `` Anathema to Star Wars fanatics who thought they reduced the Force to a kind of viral infection , midi - chlorians provide a biological interface , the link between physical bodies and spiritual energy . '' Referring to `` midi - chlorians '' became a screenwriting shorthand for over-explaining a concept . Although Chris Taylor suggested fans want less detail , not more , in explaining the Force , the introduction of midi - chlorians provided depth to the franchise and fomented engagement among fans and franchise writers . Religion expert John D. Caputo writes , `` In the ' Gospel according to Lucas ' a world is conjured up in which the intractable oppositions that have tormented religious thinkers for centuries are reconciled ... The gifts that the Jedi masters enjoy have a perfectly plausible scientific basis , even if its ways are mysterious '' . Characters ' faith in the Force reinforces the Rogue One 's message of hope .
