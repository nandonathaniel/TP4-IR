The Americans rejected the Stamp Act of 1765 brought in by British Prime Minister George Grenville , and violently rejected the remaining tax on tea imports , under the Tea Act passed in May 1773 , at the Boston Tea Party on December 16 , 1773 . The Parliament considered this an illegal act because they believed it undermined the authority of the Crown - in - Parliament . When the British then used the military to enforce laws that the colonists believed Parliament had passed illegally , the colonists responded by forming militias and seized political control of each colony , ousting the royal governors -- with the exception of the American - born Royal Governor of Connecticut , John Trumbull , who was allowed to remain as the new Patriot Governor .
