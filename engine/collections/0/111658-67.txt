With iOS 10.2. 1 , Apple made improvements to reduce occurrences of unexpected shutdowns that a small number of users were experiencing with their iPhone . iOS 10.2. 1 already has over 50 % of active iOS devices upgraded and the diagnostic data we 've received from upgraders shows that for this small percentage of users experiencing the issue , we 're seeing a more than 80 % reduction in iPhone 6s and over 70 % reduction on iPhone 6 of devices unexpectedly shutting down . We also added the ability for the phone to restart without needing to connect to power , if a user still encounters an unexpected shutdown . It is important to note that these unexpected shutdowns are not a safety issue , but we understand it can be an inconvenience and wanted to fix the issue as quickly as possible . If a customer has any issues with their device they can contact AppleCare .
