Keselowski opened the 2013 season with four straight top - 5 finishes , including a fourth - place finish in the Daytona 500 despite being caught up in two crashes . He almost was on point to repeat what Dale Earnhardt had accomplished in 1995 -- start off the season following his championship with five top five finishes , but this attempt came to an end at the Auto Club 500 , where he finished 24th after dealing with handling issues . He posted three more top - 10s in the next three races before suffering a dropped cylinder in his engine towards the end of the Toyota Owners 400 at Richmond International Raceway that relegated him to a 33rd - place finish . From April -- May 2013 , Keselowski had one of his worst spring starts of a NASCAR season .
