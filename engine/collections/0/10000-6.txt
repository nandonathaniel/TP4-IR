The 1993 MÃ©haignerie Law required children born in France of foreign parents to request French nationality at adulthood , rather than being automatically accorded citizenship . This `` manifestation of will '' requirement was subsequently abrogated by the Guigou Law of 1998 , but children born in France of foreign parents remain foreign until obtaining legal majority .
