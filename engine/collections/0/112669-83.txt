Pepin 's son Charlemagne continued in the footsteps of his father and grandfather . He further expanded and consolidated the Frankish kingdom ( now commonly called the Carolingian Empire ) . His reign also saw a cultural rebirth , commonly called the Carolingian Renaissance . Though the exact reasons are unclear , Charlemagne was crowned `` Roman Emperor '' by Pope Leo III on Christmas Day , 800 . Upon Charlemagne 's death , his empire had united much of modern - day France , western Germany and northern Italy . The years after his death illustrated how Germanic his empire remained . Rather than an orderly succession , his empire was divided in accordance with Frankish inheritance custom , which resulted in instability that plagued his empire until the last king of a united empire , Charles the Fat , died in 887 , which resulted in a permanent split of the empire into West Francia and East Francia . West Francia would be ruled by Carolingians until 987 and East Francia until 911 , after which time the partition of the empire into France and Germany was complete .
