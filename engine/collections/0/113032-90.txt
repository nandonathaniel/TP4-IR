A rule variant common in bar pool versions of eight - ball , in which the 8 - ball must be pocketed on a bank shot ( generally this would either be accomplished via a bank shot proper or a kick shot ) ; shooting the 8 straight in is a loss of game . Players may agree before the game begins to invoke this rule , or one player may challenge another player ( who might accept or refuse ) to conclude the game in this manner after it is already under way . Playing bank - the - 8 can be considered rude if many other players are waiting to use the table , since it often makes the game last considerably longer . Often on bar tables three scratches determines a loss . The same with last - pocket .
