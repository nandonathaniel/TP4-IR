BCal entered into a bid to acquire at least one Concorde . However , BCal eventually arranged for two aircraft to be leased from BA and AÃ©rospatiale respectively , to be maintained by either BA or Air France . BCal 's envisaged two - Concorde fleet would have required a high level of aircraft usage to be cost - effective ; therefore , BCal had decided to operate the second aircraft on a supersonic service between Gatwick and Atlanta , with a stopover at either Gander or Halifax . Consideration was given to services to Houston and various points on its South American network at a later stage . Both supersonic services were to be launched at some point during 1980 ; however , steeply rising oil prices caused by the 1979 energy crisis led to BCal shelving their supersonic ambitions .
