The song was spelled as `` In the Still of the Nite '' to avoid confusion with Cole Porter 's `` In the Still of the Night '' . The Five Satins rock and roll standard is at times also spelled in that manner . The song was also used in the Disney attraction The Enchanted Tiki Room ( Under New Management ) .
