Lorencez was led to believe that the people of Puebla were friendly to the French , and that the Mexican Republican garrison which kept the people in line would be overrun by the population once he made a show of force . This would prove to be a serious miscalculation on Lorencez 's part . On 5 May 1862 , against all advice , Lorencez decided to attack Puebla from the north . However , he started his attack a little too late in the day , using his artillery just before noon and by noon advancing his infantry . By the third attack the French required the full engagement of all their reserves . The French artillery had run out of ammunition , so the third infantry attack went unsupported . The Mexican forces and the Republican garrison both put up a stout defense and even took to the field to defend the positions between the hilltop forts .
