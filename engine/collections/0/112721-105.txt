It 's a Wonderful Life premiered at the Globe Theatre in New York on December 20 , 1946 , to mixed reviews . While Capra considered the contemporary critical reviews to be either universally negative or at best dismissive , Time said , `` It 's a Wonderful Life is a pretty wonderful movie . It has only one formidable rival ( Goldwyn 's The Best Years of Our Lives ) as Hollywood 's best picture of the year . Director Capra 's inventiveness , humor and affection for human beings keep it glowing with life and excitement . ''
