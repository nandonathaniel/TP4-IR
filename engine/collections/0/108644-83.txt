Income inequality in the United States has been on the rise since 1970 , as the wealthy continue to hold more and more wealth and income . For example , 95 % of income gains from 2009 to 2013 went to the top 1 % of wage earners in the United States . Progressives have recognized that lower union rates , weak policy , globalization , and other drivers have caused the gap in income . The rise of income inequality has led Progressives to draft legislation including , but not limited to , reforming Wall Street , reforming the tax code , reforming campaign finance , closing loopholes , and keeping domestic work .
