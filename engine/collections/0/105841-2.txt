In the simplest case , shown in the first picture , we are given a finite set of points ( p , ... , p ) in the Euclidean plane . In this case each site p is simply a point , and its corresponding Voronoi cell R consists of every point in the Euclidean plane whose distance to p is less than or equal to its distance to any other p . Each such cell is obtained from the intersection of half - spaces , and hence it is a convex polygon . The line segments of the Voronoi diagram are all the points in the plane that are equidistant to the two nearest sites . The Voronoi vertices ( nodes ) are the points equidistant to three ( or more ) sites .
