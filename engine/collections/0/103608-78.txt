An illuminated manuscript is not considered illuminated unless one or many illuminations contained gold foil or was brushed with gold specks , a process known as burnishing . The inclusion of gold on an illumination alludes to many different possibilities for the text . If the text is of religious nature the gold is a sign of exalting the text . In the early centuries of Christianity , `` Gospel manuscripts were sometimes written entirely in gold . '' Aside from adding flashy decoration to the text , scribes during the time considered themselves to be praising God with their use of gold . In one particular instance , `` The life of Christ executed on gold backgrounds with much greater richness in the midst of innumerable scenes of the chase , tourneys , games and grotesque subjects . '' Furthermore , gold was used if a patron who had commissioned a book to be written wished to display the vastness of his riches . Eventually , the addition of gold to manuscripts became so frequent , `` that its value as a barometer of status with the manuscript was degraded . '' During this time period the price of gold had become so cheap that its inclusion in an illuminated manuscript accounted for only a tenth of the cost of production . By adding richness and depth to the manuscript , the use of gold in illuminations created pieces of art that are still valued today .
