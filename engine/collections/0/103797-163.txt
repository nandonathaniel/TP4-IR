A clerical error at NTA prevented the copyright from being renewed properly in 1974 . Despite the lapsed copyright , television stations that aired it still had to pay royalties because -- though the film 's images had entered the public domain -- the film 's story was still restricted as a derivative work of the published story The Greatest Gift , whose copyright Philip Van Doren Stern had renewed in 1971 . The film became a perennial holiday favorite in the 1980s , possibly due to its repeated showings each holiday season on hundreds of local television stations . It was mentioned during the deliberations on the Copyright Term Extension Act of 1998 .
