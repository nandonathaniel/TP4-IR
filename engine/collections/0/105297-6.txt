During the 1900s , footballs were made out of rubber and leather which was perfect for bouncing and kicking the ball ; however , when heading the football ( hitting it with the player 's head ) it was usually painful . This problem was most probably due to water absorption of the leather from rain , which caused a considerable increase in weight , causing head or neck injury . By around 2017 , this had also been associated with dementia in former players . Another problem of early footballs was that they deteriorated quickly , as the leather used in manufacturing the footballs varied in thickness and in quality .
