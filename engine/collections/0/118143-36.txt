In 1948 , nearly 20 years before the civil rights movement swept through the non-military segments of U.S. society , President Truman signed Executive Order 9981 integrating the military and mandating equality of treatment and opportunity . It outlawed segregation in the military and made it illegal , per military law , to make a racist remark . Fifteen years later , Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara issued Department of Defense Directive 5120.36 . `` Every military commander , '' the Directive mandates , `` has the responsibility to oppose discriminatory practices affecting his men and their dependents and to foster equal opportunity for them , not only in areas under his immediate control , but also in nearby communities where they may gather in off - duty hours . '' The directive was issued in 1963 , but it was not until 1967 that the first non-military installation was declared off - limits to military personnel due to its discriminatory practices . While these directives did not eliminate all racism in the military , they continue to affect the culture in which children of military personnel grow up .
