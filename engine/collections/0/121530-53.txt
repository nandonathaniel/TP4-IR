Because anglerfish are opportunistic foragers , they show a range of preferred prey with fish at the extremes of the size spectrum , whilst showing increased selectivity for certain prey . One study examining the stomach contents of threadfin anglerfish off the Pacific coast of Central America found these fish primarily ate two categories of benthic prey : crustaceans and teleost fish . The most frequent prey were pandalid shrimp. 52 % of the stomachs examined were empty , supporting the observations that anglerfish are low energy consumers .
