Assuming that Team A and Team B had previously played as in the game in scenario one , the new tournament NRR for Team A would be : 287 + 265 50 + 50 − 243 + 267 50 + 47 2 6 = 552 100 − 510 97 2 6 = 5.52 − 5.24 = 0.28 ( \ displaystyle ( \ frac ( 287 + 265 ) ( 50 + 50 ) ) - ( \ frac ( 243 + 267 ) ( 50 + 47 ( \ frac ( 2 ) ( 6 ) ) ) ) = ( \ frac ( 552 ) ( 100 ) ) - ( \ frac ( 510 ) ( 97 ( \ frac ( 2 ) ( 6 ) ) ) ) = 5.52 - 5.24 = 0.28 ) .
