The end of the series was not the last appearance of The Young Ones . For the British charity television appeal Comic Relief , the four recorded a song and video for Cliff Richard 's `` Living Doll '' , accompanied by Richard and Shadows guitarist Hank B. Marvin . Alexei Sayle was not involved , as he felt collaborating with Richard was against the alternative ethos of the show , but had already achieved chart success in 1984 with `` ' Ullo John ! Gotta New Motor ? '' .
