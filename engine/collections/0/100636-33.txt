Professional wrestler Roddy Piper appeared as a guest VJ on MTV shortly after the song 's release . During one segment , the song 's video was played , followed by a Michael Jackson video . Piper appeared afterward , repeatedly chanting `` Dude looks like a lady ! '' in the manic fashion of a wrestling interview , intended more as a jab at Jackson than any reference to Aerosmith or the song .
