However , and simultaneously , two research groups have found independently in 2017 new theoretical evidence of the Mpemba effect and predicted also a new `` inverse '' Mpemba effect consisting on faster heating of a far - from - equilibrium cooled system , relative to another system initially hotter . Lu and Raz yield a general criterion based on Markovian statistical mechanics , predicting the appearance of the inverse Mpemba effect in the Ising model and diffusion dynamics . Lasanta and coworkers predict also the direct and inverse Mpemba effects for a granular gas in a far - from - equilibrium initial state . In this last work , it is suggested that a very generic mechanism leading to both Mpemba effects is due to a particle velocity distribution function that significantly deviates from the Maxwell - Boltzmann distribution .
