On March 18 , 1970 , postal workers in New York City -- upset over low wages and poor working conditions , and emboldened by the Civil Rights movement -- organized a strike against the United States government . The strike initially involved postal workers in only New York City , but it eventually gained support of over 210,000 United States Post Office Department workers across the nation . While the strike ended without any concessions from the Federal government , it did ultimately allow for postal worker unions and the government to negotiate a contract which gave the unions most of what they wanted , as well as the signing of the Postal Reorganization Act by President Richard Nixon on August 12 , 1970 . The Act replaced the cabinet - level Post Office Department with a new federal agency , the United States Postal Service , and took effect on July 1 , 1971 .
