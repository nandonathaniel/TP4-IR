The use of different camera speeds also appeared around 1900 in the films of Robert W. Paul and Hepworth . Paul shot scenes from On a Runaway Motor Car through Piccadilly Circus ( 1899 ) with the camera turning very slowly . When the film was projected at the usual 16 frames per second , the scenery appeared to be passing at great speed . Hepworth used the opposite effect in The Indian Chief and the Seidlitz Powder ( 1901 ) . The Chief 's movements are sped up by cranking the camera much faster than 16 frames per second . This gives what we would call a `` slow motion '' effect .
