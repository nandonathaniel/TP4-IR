The court surface changed twice , from grass ( 1887 -- 1974 ) , to Har - Tru clay ( 1975 -- 1977 ) , to hard courts since 1978 . No women 's tennis player won the event on all three surfaces , and no women 's tennis player won it on both grass and clay . Chris Evert was the only one to win the event on clay and on hard court , thereby making her the only woman to win on two different surfaces at the event .
