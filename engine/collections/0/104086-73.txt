After the fall of the Qing in 1911 , Dr. Sun Yat - sen , the leader of the newly risen Republic of China , developed similar procedures for the new political system through an institution called the Examination Yuan , one of the five branches of government , although this was quickly suspended due to the turmoil in China between the two world wars , such as the warlord period and the Japanese invasion . The Kuomintang administration revived the Examination Yuan in 1947 after the defeat of Japan . This system continues into present times in Taiwan along with the government itself after loss of the mainland to the Communist Party of China .
