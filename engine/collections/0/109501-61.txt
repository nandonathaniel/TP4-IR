Although the French succeeded in their objective during the Ruhr occupation , the Germans had wrecked their economy by funding passive resistance and brought about hyperinflation .

Dawes was formed to consider `` from a purely technical standpoint '' how to balance the German budget , stabilize the economy and set an achievable level of reparations .
