The 1913 Plan of Guadalupe , was narrowly political , but Carranza sought to consolidate his position with support of the masses by policies of social and agrarian reform . As revolutionary violence subsided in 1916 , leaders met to draw up a new constitution , thus making principles for which many of the revolutionaries had fought into law . The Mexican Constitution of 1917 was strongly nationalist , giving the Mexican government the power to expropriate foreign ownership of resources and enabling land reform ( Article 27 ) . It also had a strong code protecting organized labor ( Article 123 ) , and extended state power over the Roman Catholic Church in Mexico in its role in education ( Article 3 ) . The constitution was far more radical than Carranza himself . While he was elected constitutional president in 1917 , he did not implement its most radical elements . He was not in a position to do so in any case , since there were still threats to his regime regionally , despite the relative subsidence of violence nationally .
