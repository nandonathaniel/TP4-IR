While the UV Index can be calculated from a direct measurement of the UV spectral power at a given location , as some inexpensive portable devices are able to approximate , the value given in weather reports is usually a prediction based on a computer model . Although this may be in error ( especially when cloud conditions are unexpectedly heavy or light ) , it is usually within Â± 1 UV Index unit as that which would be measured .
