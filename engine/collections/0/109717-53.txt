The Mirrors ( voiced by Brian Peck in the original series ; and Michael Airington in the sequel series ) are London 's free - standing talking mirrors ( it was mentioned that there are more than one ) . They first appeared in the season 2 crossover episode That 's So Suite Life of Hannah Montana . London stated that the mirrors were engineered by her father 's scientists , and that they are programmed to only compliment her fashion while giving snobby fashion insults to others who stand in front of them . It is implied several times that the mirrors have artificial intelligence , as they regularly make sarcastic comments about London 's intelligence . The Mirror is a parody of the Magic Mirror used by Queen Grimhilde ( The Evil Queen ) from the fairytale Snow White . The Mirror re-appears in the Suite Life on Deck season 3 episode `` A London Carol '' representing the Ghosts of Christmas Past , Present and Future in London 's dream and also in the Suite Life On Deck season 2 episode `` Once Upon a Suite Life '' literally as the Magic Mirror from Snow White .
