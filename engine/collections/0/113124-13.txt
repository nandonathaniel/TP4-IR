The mining cycle caused a huge impact and stimulus to the production of staple foods and this is when cheese bread was created . The Northeast and the nearest regions obtained beans , rice , corn and its cornmeal , pork and lard , milk and cheese . More distant areas such as the gaucho pampa , began to offer kind of beef meat . It is said that the cheese bread was offered by slave women to the farmers . At the time , wheat flour , the raw material of classical baking was hard to find . Typical of temperate regions , the ancient cereal never combined with the warmth of the Brazilian Northeast , and was then imported from Europe to Brazil to serve the King 's noblemen .
