The lagging strand is synthesized in short , separated segments . On the lagging strand template , a primase `` reads '' the template DNA and initiates synthesis of a short complementary RNA primer . A DNA polymerase extends the primed segments , forming Okazaki fragments . The RNA primers are then removed and replaced with DNA , and the fragments of DNA are joined together by DNA ligase .
