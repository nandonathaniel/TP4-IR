Virginia remained in drydock for almost a month , getting repairs for battle damage as well as minor modifications to improve her performance . On April 4 , she was able to leave drydock. Buchanan , still recovering from his wound , had hoped that Catesby Jones would be picked to succeed him , and most observers believed that Jones 's performance during the battle was outstanding . The seniority system for promotion in the Navy scuttled his chances , however , and the post went to the 67 - year - old Commodore Josiah Tattnall . Monitor , not severely damaged , remained on duty . Like his antagonist Jones , Greene was deemed too young to remain as captain ; the day after the battle , he was replaced with Lieutenant Thomas O. Selfridge . Two days later , Selfridge was in turn relieved by Lieutenant William Nicholson Jeffers .
