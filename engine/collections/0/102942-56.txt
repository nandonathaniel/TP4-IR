Before the 1999 season , fans began discussing Earnhardt 's age and speculating that with his son , Dale Jr. , making his Winston Cup debut , Earnhardt might be contemplating retirement . Earnhardt swept both races for the year at Talladega , leading some to conclude that his talent had become limited to the restrictor plate tracks , which require a unique skill set and an exceptionally powerful racecar to win . But halfway through the year , Earnhardt began to show some of the old spark . In the August race at Michigan , he led laps late in the race and nearly pulled off his first win on a non-restrictor - plate track since 1996 .
