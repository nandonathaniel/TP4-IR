Monuments have been created for thousands of years , and they are often the most durable and famous symbols of ancient civilizations . Prehistoric tumuli , dolmens , and similar structures have been created in a large number of prehistoric cultures across the world , and the many forms of monumental tombs of the more wealthy and powerful members of a society are often the source of much of our information and art from those cultures . As societies became organized on a larger scale , so monuments so large as to be difficult to destroy like the Egyptian Pyramids , the Greek Parthenon , the Great Wall of China , Indian Taj Mahal or the Moai of Easter Island have become symbols of their civilizations . In more recent times , monumental structures such as the Statue of Liberty and Eiffel Tower have become iconic emblems of modern nation - states . The term monumentality relates to the symbolic status and physical presence of a monument . In this context , German art historian Helmut Scharf states that `` A monument exists in the form of an object and also as symbol thereof . As a language symbol , a monument usually refers to something concrete , in some rare cases it is also used metaphorically ( ... ) . A monument can be a language symbol for a unity of several monuments ( ... ) or only for a single one , but in a broader sense it can also be used in nearly all knowable planes of being . ( ... ) What is considered a monument always depends on the importance it attributes to the prevailing or traditional consciousness of a specific historical and social situation . ''
