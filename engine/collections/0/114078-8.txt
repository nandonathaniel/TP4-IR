The expression `` foreign word '' used in the illustration below is , however , an incorrect translation of the German term Fremdwort , which refers to loanwords whose pronunciation , spelling , and possible inflection or gender have not yet been so much adapted to the new language that they cease to feel foreign . Such a separation of loanwords into two distinct categories is not used by linguists in English in talking about any language . In addition , basing such a separation mainly on spelling as described in the illustration is ( or , in fact , was ) not usually done except by German linguists and only when talking about German and sometimes other languages that tend to adapt foreign spellings , which is rare in English unless the word has been in wide use for a very long time .
