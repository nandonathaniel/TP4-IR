In 1963 , Weaver left the series to pursue a broader acting career in TV series and films . In 1964 , Curtis was signed as a regular to play the stubbornly illiterate hillbilly Festus Haggen . The character , heretofore a comic feature , came to town in a 1962 episode titled `` Us Haggens , '' to avenge the death of his twin brother Fergus , and decided to stay in Dodge when the deed was done . Initially on the fringes of Dodge society , Festus was slowly phased in as a reliable sidekick / part - time deputy to Matt Dillon when Reynolds left in 1965 . In the episode `` Alias Festus Haggen , '' he is mistaken for a robber and killer whom he has to expose to free himself ( both parts played by Curtis ) . In a comic relief episode ( `` Mad Dog , '' another case of mistaken identity forces Festus to fight three sons of a man killed by his cousin . As a side note , only one episode has all three actors in it playing their respective roles . It is the 1964 episode entitled `` Prairie Wolfer '' ( season 9 , episode 16 ( episode 321 ) ) , with Dennis Weaver as Chester , Burt Reynolds as Quint , and Ken Curtis as Festus . The 1964 episode entitled `` Once a Haggen '' ( season 9 , episode 18 ( episode 323 ) ) is the second of only two occasions in which Chester and Festus appear in the same episode .
