The first transcontinental rail passengers arrived at the Pacific Railroad 's original western terminus at the Alameda Mole on September 6 , 1869 where they transferred to the steamer Alameda for transport across the Bay to San Francisco . The road 's rail terminus was moved two months later to the Oakland Long Wharf about a mile to the north . Service between San Francisco and Oakland Pier continued to be provided by ferry .
