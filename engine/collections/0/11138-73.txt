Marcel and Klaus stampede the vampire 's household , killing everyone , except Greta , who admits to being the one who kidnapped Hayley . As they bleed her of vervain , she confesses that her husband was killed by Klaus and that Hayley will be delivered to them safely if Hope undergoes the same spell Klaus did to suppress his werewolf side . Marcel contacts Freya , who attempts the spell reluctantly , but Klaus stops it . In France , Antoinette tells Elijah that she had met him before their encounter in New York . Their relationship is strained as Antoinette talks about her father , Auguste , a vampire zealot who slaughtered werewolves , an artist who Elijah and Klaus had threatened in the 1930s . During that time , Klaus ultimately murdered Auguste along with his villagers , claiming that anyone who could pick up a coin laying next to his body would be shown mercy . Auguste 's wife scrambles out of their house and picks up the coin , begging Klaus to show mercy on her , her daughter , and her son -- respectively Greta , Antoinette , and Roman . In the present , Roman and Hope sneak out of the Salvatore School .
