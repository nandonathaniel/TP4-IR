Aloy was cast out from the Nora tribe at birth , raised by an outcast named Rost ( JB Blanc ) . As a child , she obtained a Focus , a small augmented reality device that gives her special perceptive abilities . After coming of age , Aloy ( Ashly Burch ) enters a competition called the Proving to win the right to become a Nora Brave , and by extension , a member of the Nora tribe . Aloy wins the competition , but the Nora are suddenly attacked by cultists . Aloy is almost killed by their leader Helis ( Crispin Freeman ) , but is saved by Rost , who sacrifices himself to save Aloy from a bomb . When Aloy awakes , a Matriarch explains that the cultists had gained control of corrupted machines . Aloy also learns that as an infant , she was found at the foot of a sealed door . An Oseram foreigner called Olin ( Chook Sibtain ) informs Aloy that the cultists are part of a group calling themselves the Eclipse . Olin indicates that the reason Aloy was targeted by the Eclipse was due to her resemblance to an Old World scientist named Dr. Elisabet Sobeck ( also voiced by Burch ) .
