After reuniting with the other three , Marie and the group proceed further down into the village 's hidden bunker , where Straub has set up his laboratory . There , they fend off against Straub 's undead horde , as well as Richter , whose obsession on weaponization of Geistkraft puts him at odds with Straub . Eventually , the group recovers the artifact , the hilt of Emperor Frederick Barbarossa 's sword . They then encounter the creature from earlier , a humanoid - shaped amalgam of numerous body parts sewn and stitched together , dubbed the Panzermörder , with Klaus fused into the creature 's chest . Using special magnetized batteries , the group manages to stun the Panzermörder and attach the batteries onto it , causing it to be attracted to Richter 's zeppelin flying above the village . The zeppelin explodes , killing the Panzermörder and freeing Klaus from its body . The hilt 's power somehow revives Klaus , causing him to be possessed by an unknown force . Klaus staggers into the village , telling Marie and the group to continue fighting , and that the Emperor must not return , before activating a fire trap , seemingly killing himself .
