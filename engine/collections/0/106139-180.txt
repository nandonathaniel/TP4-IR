Bergoglio told his authorized biographer , Sergio Rubin , that after the priests ' imprisonment , he worked behind the scenes for their release ; Bergoglio 's intercession with dictator Jorge Rafael Videla on their behalf may have saved their lives . Bergoglio also told Rubin that he had often sheltered people from the dictatorship on church property , and once gave his own identity papers to a man who looked like him , so he could flee Argentina . The interview with Rubin , reflected in the biography El jesuita , is the only time Bergoglio has spoken to the press about those events . Alicia Oliveira , a former Argentine judge , has also reported that Bergoglio helped people flee Argentina during the rule of the junta . Since Francis became Pope , Gonzalo Mosca and Jos√© Caravias have related to journalists accounts of how Bergoglio helped them flee the Argentine dictatorship .
