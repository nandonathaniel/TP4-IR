The reading of psalms is viewed in Jewish tradition as a vehicle for gaining God 's favor . They are thus often specially recited in times of trouble , such as poverty , disease , or physical danger ; in many synagogues , Psalms are recited after services for the security of the State of Israel . Note that Sefer ha - Chinuch states that this practice is designed not to achieve favor , as such , but rather to inculcate belief in Divine Providence into one 's consciousness , consistently with Maimonides ' general view on Providence . ( Relatedly , the Hebrew verb for prayer , hitpalal התפלל , is in fact the reflexive form of palal פלל , to judge . Thus , `` to pray '' conveys the notion of `` judging oneself '' : ultimately , the purpose of prayer -- tefilah תפלה -- is to transform ourselves . )
