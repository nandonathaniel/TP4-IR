In mice and humans , alterations in serotonin levels and signalling have been shown to regulate bone mass . Mice that lack brain serotonin have osteopenia , while mice that lack gut serotonin have high bone density . In humans , increased blood serotonin levels have been shown to be significant negative predictor of low bone density . Serotonin can also be synthesized , albeit at very low levels , in the bone cells . It mediates its actions on bone cells using three different receptors . Through 5 - HT receptors , it negatively regulates bone mass , while it does so positively through 5 - HT receptors and 5 - HT receptors . There is very delicate balance between physiological role of gut serotonin and its pathology . Increase in the extracellular content of serotonin results in a complex relay of signals in the osteoblasts culminating in FoxO1 / Creb and ATF4 dependent transcriptional events . These studies have opened a new area of research in bone metabolism that can be potentially harnessed to treat bone mass disorders .
