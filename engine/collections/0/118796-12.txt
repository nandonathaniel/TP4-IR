During World War II , FIFA struggled to keep itself afloat , and it had no financial or personnel resources with which to plan a peacetime tournament for when hostilities ended . When the war ended in 1945 , it was clear that FIFA would have no hope in a single year of planning and scheduling a 1946 World Cup . In fact , FIFA 's first meeting was on July 1 , 1946 -- around the time the 1946 World Cup would ordinarily have been played -- and when it planned the next World Cup for 1949 no country would host it . The major international tournament in 1946 was the 1946 South American Championship in which Argentina beat Brazil 2 -- 0 on February 10 , 1946 .
