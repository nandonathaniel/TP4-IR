The logotype eventually selected for on - screen use originated in a promotional brochure that was distributed by Fox to cinema owners in 1976 . This brochure was designed by Suzy Rice , a young art director at the Los Angeles advertising agency Seiniger Advertising . On a visit to ILM in Van Nuys , Rice was instructed by Lucas to produce a logo that would intimidate the viewer , and he reportedly asked for the logo to appear `` very fascist '' in style . Rice 's response to her brief was to use an outlined , modified Helvetica Black . After some feedback from Lucas , Rice decided to join the S and T of STAR and the R and S of WARS . Lucas signed off the brochure in between takes while filming inserts for the Mos Eisley Cantina scene . Gary Kurtz was impressed with Rice 's logo and selected it over Perri 's design for the film 's opening titles , after modifying the letter W to flatten the pointed tips originally designed by Rice . This finalised the design of one of the most recognisable logos in cinema design , although Rice 's contribution was not credited in the film .
