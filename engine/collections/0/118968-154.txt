Evidence of infection in fossil remains is a subject of interest for paleopathologists , scientists who study occurrences of injuries and illness in extinct life forms . Signs of infection have been discovered in the bones of carnivorous dinosaurs . When present , however , these infections seem to tend to be confined to only small regions of the body . A skull attributed to the early carnivorous dinosaur Herrerasaurus ischigualastensis exhibits pit - like wounds surrounded by swollen and porous bone . The unusual texture of the bone around the wounds suggests they were afflicted by a short - lived , non-lethal infection . Scientists who studied the skull speculated that the bite marks were received in a fight with another Herrerasaurus . Other carnivorous dinosaurs with documented evidence of infection include Acrocanthosaurus , Allosaurus , Tyrannosaurus and a tyrannosaur from the Kirtland Formation . The infections from both tyrannosaurs were received by being bitten during a fight , like the Herrerasaurus specimen .
