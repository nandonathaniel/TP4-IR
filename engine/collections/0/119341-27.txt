Calcium is a necessary ion in the formation of the mitotic spindle . Without the mitotic spindle , cellular division can not occur . Although young leaves have a higher need for calcium , older leaves contain higher amounts of calcium because calcium is relatively immobile through the plant . It is not transported through the phloem because it can bind with other nutrient ions and precipitate out of liquid solutions .
