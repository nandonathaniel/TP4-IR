Agriculture ranks among the most hazardous industries due to the use of chemicals and risk of injury . Farmers are at high risk for fatal and nonfatal injuries ( general traumatic injury and musculoskeletal injury ) , work - related lung diseases , noise - induced hearing loss , skin diseases , chemical - related illnesses , and certain cancers associated with chemical use and prolonged sun exposure . In an average year , 516 workers die doing farm work in the U.S. ( 1992 -- 2005 ) . Every day , about 243 agricultural workers suffer lost - work - time injuries , and about 5 % of these result in permanent impairment . Tractor overturns are the leading cause of agriculture - related fatal injuries , and account for over 90 deaths every year . The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health recommends the use of roll over protection structures on tractors to reduce the risk of overturn - related fatal injuries .
