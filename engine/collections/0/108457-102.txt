Influenced by his television and film scripting background , Martin tries to keep readers engrossed by ending each A Song of Ice and Fire chapter with a tense or revelational moment , a twist or a cliffhanger , similar to a TV act break . Scriptwriting has also taught him the technique of `` cutting out the fat and leaving the muscle '' , which is the final stage of completing a book , a technique that brought the page count in A Dance with Dragons down almost eighty pages . Dividing the continuous A Song of Ice and Fire story into books is much harder for Martin . Each book shall represent a phase of the journey that ends in closure for most characters . A smaller portion of characters is left with clear - cut cliffhangers to make sure readers come back for the next installment , although A Dance with Dragons had more cliffhangers than Martin originally intended . Both one - time and regular POV characters are designed to have full character arcs ending in tragedy or triumph , and are written to hold the readers ' interest and not be skipped in reading . Main characters are killed off so that the reader will not rely on the hero to come through unscathed and will instead feel the character 's fear with each page turn .
