Both were Christians and confiscated the temple lands that Julian had restored , but were generally tolerant of other beliefs . Valentinian in the West refused to intervene in religious controversy ; in the East , Valens had to deal with Christians who did not conform to his ideas of orthodoxy , and persecution formed part of his response . The wealth of the church increased dramatically , immense resources both public and private being used for ecclesiastical construction and support of the religious life . Bishops in wealthy cities were thus able to offer vast patronage ; Ammianus described some as `` enriched from the offerings of matrons , ride seated in carriages , wearing clothing chosen with care , and serve banquets so lavish that their entertainments outdo the tables of kings '' . Edward Gibbon remarked that `` the soldiers ' pay was lavished on the useless multitudes of both sexes who could only plead the merits of abstinence and chastity '' , though there are no figures for the monks and nuns nor for their maintenance costs . Pagan rituals and buildings had not been cheap either ; the move to Christianity may not have had significant effects on the public finances . Some public disorder also followed competition for prestigious posts ; Pope Damasus I was installed in 366 after an election whose casualties included a hundred and thirty - seven corpses in the basilica of Sicininus .
