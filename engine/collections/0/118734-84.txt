According to David Prior , producer of the subsequent two - disc special edition , the initial bare bones edition `` was only reluctantly agreed to by Fincher because I needed more time on the bonus material . The studio was locked into their release date , so Fincher allowed that version to be released first . It had nothing to do with Fincher ' double dipping his own movie before it even makes it to stores ' and everything to do with buying more time for the special edition '' . He stated that the theatrical cut would only be available on the single - disc edition . Prior elaborated further : `` Nobody wants fans feeling like they 're being taken advantage of , and I know that double - dipping creates that impression . That 's why it was so important to me that consumers be told there was another version coming . In this case it really was a rock - and - a-hard - place situation , and delaying the second release was done strictly for the benefit of the final product ... But this is a very ambitious project , easily the most far - reaching I 've ever worked on , and owing largely to studio snafus that I ca n't really elaborate on , I did n't have enough time to do it properly . Thus Fincher bought me the extra time by agreeing to a staggered release , which I 'm very grateful for '' . In its first week , rentals for the DVD earned $6.7 million .
