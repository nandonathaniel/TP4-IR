Any of the three medians through the centroid divides the triangle 's area in half . This is not true for other lines through the centroid ; the greatest departure from the equal - area division occurs when a line through the centroid is parallel to a side of the triangle , creating a smaller triangle and a trapezoid ; in this case the trapezoid 's area is 5 / 9 that of the original triangle .
