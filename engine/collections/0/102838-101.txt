In 1653 Cromwell had been made head of state with the title Lord Protector of the Realm . The Second Protectorate Parliament offered him the crown . Cromwell rejected this offer , but the governmental structure embodied in the final version of the Humble Petition and Advice was a basis for all future parliaments . It proposed an elected House of Commons as the Lower Chamber , a House of Lords containing peers of the realm as the Upper Chamber , and a constitutional monarchy , subservient to parliament and the laws of the nation , as the executive arm of the state at the top of the tree , assisted in carrying out their duties by a Privy Council . Oliver Cromwell had thus inadvertently presided over the creation of a basis for the future parliamentary government of England . In 1657 he had the Parliament of Scotland unified with the English Parliament .
