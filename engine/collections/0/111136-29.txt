A hard - drinking Anglo widower , Ed stubbornly refuses to fit in with the changing East L.A. neighborhood and has alienated most of the people who live around him . He uses ethnic slurs and berates Chico , a Latino , in an effort to get him to leave when Chico comes looking for a job . Yet Chico sees something in Ed , and sneaks back in at night to clean up the garage and move into an old van that Ed has parked inside . As Ed sees all the effort Chico has put in , he begins to warm to Chico . Over the course of the show , Ed grows to see Chico as family , although Ed denies this on several occasions .
