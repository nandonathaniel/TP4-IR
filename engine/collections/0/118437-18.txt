Breckenridge is interested in photography and has her own darkroom in her apartment . At age 24 , she began taking photography seriously as a form of self - expression . Her then - boyfriend Bryten Goss helped her with lighting . In 2008 , she had her first exhibit with Shalon Goss hosted by her uncle Michael Weatherly and presented by Edgar Valera . She said , `` I had so much to express emotionally with this show . Each photo is an expression of myself and the things I have gone through in the last three years . From my perspective , the purpose of art is to evoke feeling and to inspire . That 's all I hope to achieve . ''
