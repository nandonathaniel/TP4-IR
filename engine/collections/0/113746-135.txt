Domestic television covers the most important stages of the Tour , such as those in the mountains , from mid-morning until early evening . Coverage typically starts with a survey of the day 's route , interviews along the road , discussions of the difficulties and tactics ahead , and a 30 - minute archive feature . The biggest stages are shown live from start to end , followed by interviews with riders and others and features such an edited version of the stage seen from beside a team manager following and advising riders from his car . Radio covers the race in updates throughout the day , particularly on the national news channel , France Info , and some stations provide continuous commentary on long wave . The 1979 Tour was the first to be broadcast in the United States .
