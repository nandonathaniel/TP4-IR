With the end of the war , the British agreed to transfer power to Indian hands . All political prisoners were released in 1946 and Azad led the Congress in the elections for the new Constituent Assembly of India , which would draft India 's constitution . He headed the delegation to negotiate with the British Cabinet Mission , in his sixth year as Congress president . While attacking Jinnah 's demand for Pakistan and the mission 's proposal of 16 June 1946 that envisaged the partition of India , Azad became a strong proponent of the mission 's earlier proposal of 16 May . The proposal advocated a federal system with a limited central government and autonomy for the provinces . The central government would have Defence , Foreign Affairs and Communication while the provinces would win all other subjects unless they voluntarily relinquished selected subjects to the Central Government . Additionally , the proposal called for the `` grouping '' of provinces on religious lines , which would informally band together the Muslim - majority province in the West as Group B , Muslim - majority provinces of Bengal and Assam as Group C and the rest of India as Group A. While Gandhi and others expressed scepticism of this clause , Azad argued that Jinnah 's demand for Pakistan would be buried and the concerns of the Muslim community would be assuaged . Under Azad and Patel 's backing , the Working Committee approved the resolution against Gandhi 's advice . Azad also managed to win Jinnah 's agreement to the proposal citing the greater good of all Indian Muslims .
