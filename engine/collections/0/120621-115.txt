The end of Austrian dominance of the German states shifted Austria 's attention to the Balkans . In 1867 , the Austrian emperor Franz Joseph accepted a settlement ( the Austro - Hungarian Compromise of 1867 ) in which he gave his Hungarian holdings equal status with his Austrian domains , creating the Dual Monarchy of Austria - Hungary . The Peace of Prague ( 1866 ) offered lenient terms to Austria , in which Austria 's relationship with the new nation - state of Italy underwent major restructuring ; although the Austrians were far more successful in the military field against Italian troops , the monarchy lost the important province of Venetia . The Habsburgs ceded Venetia to France , which then formally transferred control to Italy . The French public resented the Prussian victory and demanded Revanche pour Sadov√° ( `` Revenge for Sadova '' ) , illustrating anti-Prussian sentiment in France -- a problem that would accelerate in the months leading up to the Franco - Prussian War . The Austro - Prussian War also damaged relations with the French government . At a meeting in Biarritz in September 1865 with Napoleon III , Bismarck had let it be understood ( or Napoleon had thought he understood ) that France might annex parts of Belgium and Luxembourg in exchange for its neutrality in the war . These annexations did not happen , resulting in animosity from Napoleon towards Bismarck .
