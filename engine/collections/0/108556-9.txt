The White Crested is similar to the American , but they have one white rosette on the forehead . The breed standards and ideals are nearly identical , with the exception that a White Crested cavy 's crest should be completely of a color different from the rest of the animal . Most usually the crest is white , as necessitated by the ACBA standard . No other white hair should be present in the animal . By this standard , White Cresteds are not bred in colourations that have white anywhere on the body , such as Dutch , roan , and Dalmatian .
