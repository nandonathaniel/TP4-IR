Even before the negative influence on public opinion caused by the 2006 backdating scandal , use of options faced various criticisms . A particularly forceful and long running argument concerned the interaction of executive options with corporate stock repurchase programs . Numerous authorities ( including U.S. Federal Reserve Board economist Weisbenner ) determined options may be employed in concert with stock buybacks in a manner contrary to shareholder interests . These authors argued that , in part , corporate stock buybacks for U.S. Standard & Poors 500 companies surged to a $500 billion annual rate in late 2006 because of the effect of options . A compendium of academic works on the option / buyback issue is included in the study Scandal by author M. Gumport issued in 2006 .
