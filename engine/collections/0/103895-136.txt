Sometimes the produced oil will be filtered to eliminate remaining solid particles that may reduce the shelf life of the product . Labels may indicate the fact that the oil has not been filtered , suggesting a different taste . Fresh unfiltered olive oil usually has a slightly cloudy appearance , and is therefore sometimes called cloudy olive oil . This form of olive oil used to be popular only among olive oil small scale producers but is now becoming `` trendy '' , in line with consumer 's demand for products that are perceived to be less processed .
