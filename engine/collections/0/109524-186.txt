Although some Canadians took up arms in support of the rebellion , the majority remained loyal to the King . French Canadians had been satisfied by the British government 's Quebec Act of 1774 , which offered religious and linguistic toleration ; in general , they did not sympathize with a rebellion that they saw as being led by Protestants from New England , who were their commercial rivals and hereditary enemies . Most of the English - speaking settlers had arrived following the British conquest of Canada in 1759 -- 1760 , and were unlikely to support separation from Britain . The older British colonies , Newfoundland and Nova Scotia ( including what is now New Brunswick ) also remained loyal and contributed military forces in support of the Crown .
