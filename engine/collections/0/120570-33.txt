The Latin text of Genesis 32 : 30 ' Vidi dominum facie ad faciem ; et salva facta est anima mea ' ( I have seen the Lord face to face ) was set for the third nocturn at Matins on the second Sunday of Lent and was a popular medieval telling of the story of Jacob 's encounter with the angel . It is set as the tenor ( upper voice ) text of Machaut 's multi-text - layered Motet No. 15 Vidi dominum ( I have seen the LORD ) simultaneously with two secular French texts : `` Faux semblant m'a dec√º '' and `` Amours qui ha le pouvoir . '' Machaut musically contrasts God 's blessing in the Latin text with the disappointments of secular love in the French texts . Charles Wesley 's hymn `` Come , O Thou Traveller Unknown '' , often known as `` Wrestling Jacob '' , is based on the passage which describes Jacob wrestling with an angel . It is traditionally sung to the tune of St Petersburg . U2 's Bullet the Blue Sky , the 4th . track on their 1987 album The Joshua Tree includes the lyric `` Jacob wrestled the angel and the angel was overcome . ''
