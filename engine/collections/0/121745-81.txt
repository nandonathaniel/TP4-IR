In the 1994 season , the Chargers made their first and , so far , only Super Bowl appearance , against the 49ers in Super Bowl XXIX . They got to the Super Bowl by winning their first six regular season games , the only NFL team to do so in 1994 , and finished the season 11 -- 5 . Quarterback Stan Humphries and wide receiver Tony Martin combined on a 99 - yard touchdown completion to tie an NFL record during a defeat of the Seattle Seahawks , 27 -- 10 . They would become the 1994 AFC West Division champions behind a defense led by linebacker Junior Seau , defensive tackles Reuben Davis and Shawn Lee , defensive end Leslie O'Neal and an offense keyed by running back Natrone Means , Humphries and Martin . The Chargers had upset victories over the Dolphins and Steelers in the AFC playoffs . Despite those two close triumphs ( 22 -- 21 against the Dolphins in the Divisional Round , and 17 -- 13 against the Steelers in the AFC Championship Game ) , the Chargers lost Super Bowl XXIX to the San Francisco 49ers by a score of 49 -- 26 , who were led by quarterback Steve Young ( Super Bowl MVP ) and wide receiver Jerry Rice .
