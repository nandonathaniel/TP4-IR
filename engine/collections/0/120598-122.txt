Guinea possesses over 25 billion tonnes ( metric tons ) of bauxite -- and perhaps up to one - half of the world 's reserves . In addition , Guinea 's mineral wealth includes more than 4 - billion tonnes of high - grade iron ore , significant diamond and gold deposits , and undetermined quantities of uranium . Possibilities for investment and commercial activities exist in all these areas , but Guinea 's poorly developed infrastructure and rampant corruption continue to present obstacles to large - scale investment projects .
