The translucent area measured ( the nuchal translucency ) is only useful to measure between 11 and 14 weeks of gestation , when the fetal lymphatic system is developing and the peripheral resistance of the placenta is high . After 14 weeks the lymphatic system is likely to have developed sufficiently to drain away any excess fluid , and changes to the placental circulation will result in a drop in peripheral resistance . So after this time any abnormalities causing fluid accumulation may seem to correct themselves and can thus go undetected by nuchal scanning .
