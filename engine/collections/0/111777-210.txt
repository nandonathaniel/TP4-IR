This situation of multiple possible causes or motivations for the crusades has led to extended debates in modern historiography . A theory proposed by Carl Erdmann ( 1935 ) , known as the `` Erdmann thesis '' , links the First Crusade l to the Gregorian Reform , the series of reforms initiated by Pope Gregory VII during c. 1050 -- 80 . These reforms re-established the Western Church , which had been much weakened during the 10th century , as a relevant power able to inspire and co-ordinate the crusades . The `` Erdmann thesis '' proposes that the strengthened Western Church , combined with the weakened Byzantine Empire , permitted a projection of power from west to east , with the actual conquest of Jerusalem figuring at best as a secondary , popular goal .
