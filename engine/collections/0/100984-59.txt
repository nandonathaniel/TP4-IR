Washington and his army encamped at Valley Forge in December 1777 , about 20 miles ( 32 km ) from Philadelphia , where they stayed for the next six months . Over the winter , 2,500 men ( out of 10,000 ) died from disease and exposure . However , the army eventually emerged from Valley Forge in good order , thanks in part to a training program supervised by Baron von Steuben .
