Prior to 1806 , German - speaking Central Europe included more than 300 political entities , most of which were part of the Holy Roman Empire or the extensive Habsburg hereditary dominions . They ranged in size from the small and complex territories of the princely Hohenlohe family branches to sizable , well - defined territories such as the Kingdoms of Bavaria and Prussia . Their governance varied : they included free imperial cities , also of different sizes , such as the powerful Augsburg and the minuscule Weil der Stadt ; ecclesiastical territories , also of varying sizes and influence , such as the wealthy Abbey of Reichenau and the powerful Archbishopric of Cologne ; and dynastic states such as WÃ¼rttemberg . These lands ( or parts of them -- both the Habsburg domains and Hohenzollern Prussia also included territories outside the Empire structures ) made up the territory of the Holy Roman Empire , which at times included more than 1,000 entities . Since the 15th century , with few exceptions , the Empire 's Prince - electors had chosen successive heads of the House of Habsburg to hold the title of Holy Roman Emperor . Among the German - speaking states , the Holy Roman Empire administrative and legal mechanisms provided a venue to resolve disputes between peasants and landlords , between jurisdictions , and within jurisdictions . Through the organization of imperial circles ( Reichskreise ) , groups of states consolidated resources and promoted regional and organizational interests , including economic cooperation and military protection .
