Kat continued to investigate Charlotte despite being suspended for having alcohol in her system . She started to suspect Charlotte might also be involved in Denny 's disappearance , and confronted her about Denny 's connection to Trystan and Gunno . Although Charlotte `` coolly pleads her ignorance '' , it left Kat more suspicious of her . Desperate not to get caught out by Kat , Charlotte targeted her again . As Kat was searching through Denny 's belongings at the Farmhouse , she was hit from behind by two men and left next to the oven with the gas on . Charlotte then received a text message informing her that Kat had been dealt with per her plan . Charlotte was `` filled with relief that her problem has seemingly been sorted '' .
