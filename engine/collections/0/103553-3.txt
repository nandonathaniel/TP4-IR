Beer may only be purchased in large quantities from a distributor . Beer distributors mainly sell kegs of beer and cases . A beer distributor is also allowed to sell any package intended for resale by a PLCB - approved brewery containing any variety of bottle / can arrangements greater than or equal to 128 ounces . Beverage distributors ( which also sell soft drinks ) may sell beer and malt liquor , but not wine or hard liquor . People under 21 may enter most beverage distributors without an adult , since most distributors also sell water , soda , ice , tobacco products , and some snack foods . They are subject to the rules of the individual establishment .
