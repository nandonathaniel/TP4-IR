At the Ninth Party Congress held in Beijing in April 1969 , Mao declared the Cultural Revolution completed and named Lin Biao as successor . But on September 13 , 1971 , Lin died in a plane crash as he tried to flee to the U.S.S.R. following an unsuccessful coup plot against Mao . After Lin 's death , colleges were reopened to `` Worker - Peasant - Soldier students '' and some of the purged old guard leaders such as Deng Xiaoping were partially rehabilitated , but radical Gang of Four , led by Jiang Qing , continued to hold sway .
