A second rescue attempt , planned but never carried out , would have used highly modified YMC - 130H Hercules aircraft . Three aircraft , outfitted with rocket thrusters to allow an extremely short landing and takeoff in the Shahid Shiroudi football stadium near the embassy , were modified under a rushed , super-secret program known as Operation Credible Sport . One crashed during a demonstration at Eglin Air Force Base on October 29 , 1980 , when its braking rockets were fired too soon . The misfire caused a hard touchdown that tore off the starboard wing and started a fire , but all on board survived . After Carter lost the presidential election in November , the project was abandoned .
