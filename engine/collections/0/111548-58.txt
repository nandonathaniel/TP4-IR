Though the Indians are acknowledged to have an unquestionable , and , heretofore , unquestioned right to the lands they occupy , until that right shall be extinguished by a voluntary cession to our government ; yet it may well be doubted whether those tribes which reside within the acknowledged boundaries of the United States can , with strict accuracy , be denominated foreign nations . They may , more correctly be denominated domestic dependent nations . They occupy a territory to which we assert a title independent of their will , which must take effect in point of possession when their right of possession ceases . Meanwhile , they are in a state of pupilage . Their relation to the United States resembles that of a ward to his guardian .
