The song appears in the F. Scott Fitzgerald novel The Great Gatsby , when Daisy Buchanan and Gatsby meet again after many years , and the latter insists Klipspringer , his apparently permanent `` guest , '' to play it for them . It also appears in Dorothy Parker 's 1929 short story , `` Big Blonde . '' Warner Brothers used the song in two musicals during the early 1950s : The Gus Kahn biopic I 'll See You in My Dreams and The Eddie Cantor Story . Woody Allen used the song in his 1983 film Zelig .
