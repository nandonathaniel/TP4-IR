Yes , but it makes the ambiguity of the situation more _clear_ . It 's an improvement . The first attempt I made used the _same_ language as the sources you posted and , as such , should n't have been a problem . As such , it 's a perfect compromise -- it makes things more clear , agrees with your sources , AND does n't affect the truth value of the sentence . Also , what I changed _wasn't_ what you 've argued for this whole time . You 've never once tried to argue the difference between `` now '' and `` actually , '' as such , I do n't need consensus for that change since there 's no disagreement over it . I think there may be an `` ownership '' issue here as you 've stated on the dispute page that an `` editor , who has never contributed to the page in question , parachuted in and began to make substantial changes to the meaning of a long standing passage . '' There 's no `` seniority bonus '' on Wikipedia when it comes to making edits . Ommnomnomgulp ( talk ) 19 : 48 , 10 February 2016 ( UTC )
