There is no reservation granted on the basis of religion in the Central educational institutions at the national level , although reservation has been extended to religious minorities in some states . The Tamil Nadu government has allotted 3.5 % of seats each to Muslims and Christians , thereby altering the OBC reservation to 23 % from 30 % ( since it excludes persons belonging to Other Backward Castes who are either Muslims or Christians ) .
