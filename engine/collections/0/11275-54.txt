The Presidential Succession Act of 1792 was the first succession law passed by Congress . The act was contentious because the Federalists did not want the then Secretary of State , Thomas Jefferson , who had become the leader of the Democratic - Republicans , to follow the vice president in the succession . There were also separation of powers concerns over including the Chief Justice of the United States in the line . The compromise they worked out established the President pro tempore of the Senate as next in line after the vice president , followed by the Speaker of the House of Representatives .
