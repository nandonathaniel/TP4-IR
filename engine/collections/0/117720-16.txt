Throughout the 1780s , sectarian tension had been building in County Armagh , largely due to the relaxation of the Penal Laws . Here the number of Protestants and Catholics ( in what was then Ireland 's most populous county ) were of roughly equal number , and competition between them to rent patches of land near markets was fierce . Drunken brawls between rival gangs had by 1786 become openly sectarian . These gangs eventually reorganised as the Protestant Peep o ' Day Boys and the Catholic Defenders , with the next decade in County Armagh marked by fierce sectarian conflict between both groups , which escalated and spread into neighbouring counties .
