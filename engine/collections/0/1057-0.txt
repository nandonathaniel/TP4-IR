The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and the British Empire remained officially neutral throughout the American Civil War ( 1861 -- 1865 ) . It legally recognised the status of Confederate States of America but never recognised it as a nation and neither signed a treaty with it nor exchanged ambassadors . However , top British officials debated intervention in the first 18 months . The elite tended to support the Confederacy , but ordinary people tended to support the United States of America . Large - scale trade continued in both directions , with the Union shipping grain to Britain , and Britain sent manufactured items and munitions . Immigration continued into the US , with Britons volunteering for its army . British trade with the Confederacy fell over 90 % from the prewar period , with a small amount of cotton going to Britain and some munitions slipped in by numerous small blockade runners . They were operated and funded by British private interests , were legal under international law , caused no dispute between the US and the UK .
