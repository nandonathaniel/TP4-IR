And Then There Were None ( 1943 play ) is Christie 's adaptation of the story for the stage . She and the producers agreed that audiences might not flock to a tale with such a grim ending as the novel , nor would it work well dramatically as there would be no one left to tell the story . Thus , she reworked the ending for Lombard and Vera to be innocent of the crimes of which they were accused , survive , and fall in love with each other . Some of the names were also changed , e.g. , General Macarthur became General McKenzie ( possibly due to the real - life General Douglas MacArthur 's then playing a prominent role in the ongoing World War II ) . And Then There Were None ( 1944 play ) , Dundee Repertory Theatre Company was given special permission to restore the original ending of the novel . The company first performed a stage adaptation of the novel in 1944 under its original title . And Then There Were None ( 2005 play ) , On 14 October 2005 , a new version of the play , written by Kevin Elyot and directed by Steven Pimlott , opened at the Gielgud Theatre in London . For this version , Elyot returned to the original story , restoring the nihilism of the original .
