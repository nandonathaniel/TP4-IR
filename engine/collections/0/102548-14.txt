Transmissions across free space require information to be encoded in a carrier wave in order to shift the information to a carrier frequency suitable for transmission , this is known as modulation . Popular analog modulation techniques include amplitude modulation and frequency modulation . The choice of modulation affects the cost and performance of a system and these two factors must be balanced carefully by the engineer .
