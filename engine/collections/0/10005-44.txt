The format of the show was created by David Briggs , Mike Whitehill and Steven Knight , who had earlier created a number of the promotional games for Tarrant 's morning show on Capital FM radio , such as the bong game . Tentatively known as Cash Mountain , the show takes its finalised title from a song written by Cole Porter for the 1956 film High Society , in which it was sung by Frank Sinatra and Celeste Holm .
