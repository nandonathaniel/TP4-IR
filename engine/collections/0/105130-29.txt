For Māori chiefs , the signing at Waitangi would have needed a great deal of trust . Nonetheless , expected benefits of British protection must have outweighed their fears . In particular , the French were also interested in New Zealand , and there were fears that if they did not side with the British that the French would put pressure on them in a similar manner to that of other Pacific Islanders farther north in what would become French Polynesia . Māori at the signing were further encouraged by English Missionaries , who believed that British regulation would be invaluable to the future welfare of Māori as European settlers continued to arrive .
