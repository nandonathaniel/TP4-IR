On Day 20 , the three tribes merged on Naviti 's beach . Although the Naviti members initially planned on picking off the Malolo members , Chris and Domenick were still at odds ; Wendell tried to play moderator , to no avail . Chris found a note randomly placed in his buff , which led him to find a clue in tree mail , saying the idol was on Ghost Island ; he would travel there late that night while everyone else was asleep . He found J.T. 's Game Changers idol in plain sight , but it was only good at the next Tribal Council . However , a game of chance allowed him to extend the life of the idol for up to 5 extra Tribal Councils ; there were 10 chests to choose from . He extended the idol once , but lost his vote at the next Tribal Council . Immunity Challenge : Castaways must hold a boom pole over their head with a tiki statue at the end , while standing on a narrow perch . Every few minutes , the castaways will step forward . If they fall off the perch or their tiki statue drops , they are out of the challenge . The last person standing wins . Kellyn outlasted Libby to win immunity . Back at camp , Chris gathered everyone except Domenick and Wendell in an attempt to dictate a split vote between those two in case Domenick played his idol . While they were alone , Wendell told Domenick about his idol . Donathan immediately told them about Chris 's plan to split the votes , while Desiree gathered the Naviti women to discuss a blindside of Libby , since everyone might be voting for either Chris , Domenick , or Wendell . At Tribal Council , Domenick openly wore his fake idol , then played the Legacy Advantage on himself , while Chris decided not to play his idol . Desiree and Angela voted against Libby , but everyone else voted against Chris , making him the first member of the jury .
