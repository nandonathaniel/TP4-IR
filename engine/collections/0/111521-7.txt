Dorian Wiszniewski and Richard Coyne in their contribution to the book Building Virtual Communities explore online identity , with emphasis on the concept of `` masking '' identity . They point out that whenever an individual interacts in a social sphere they portray a mask of their identity . This is no different online and in fact becomes even more pronounced due to the decisions an online contributor must make concerning his or her online profile . He or she must answer specific questions about age , gender , address , username and so forth . Furthermore , with the accrual of one 's online activity , his or her mask is increasingly defined by his or her style of writing , vocabulary and topics .
