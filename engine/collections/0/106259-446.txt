`` He ( Antiochus ) crossed the Caucasus and descended into India ; renewed his friendship with Sophagasenus the king of the Indians ; received more elephants , until he had a hundred and fifty altogether ; and having once more provisioned his troops , set out again personally with his army : leaving Androsthenes of Cyzicus the duty of taking home the treasure which this king had agreed to hand over to him '' . Polybius 11.39
