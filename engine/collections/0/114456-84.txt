On May 16 , 2013 , the Maloof family reached agreement to sell the Sacramento Kings to a group led by Silicon Valley tech entrepreneur Vivek Ranadivé for a then - record NBA franchise valuation of $535 million . Ranadivé , 55 , named Raj Bhathal , 71 , founder of Tustin - based Raj Manufacturing , one of the largest swimwear companies in the nation , as one of the investors in a consortium to buy a majority stake in the Kings from the franchise 's longtime owners , the Maloof family , for a reported $348 million . The group fought off a rival bid that would have moved the team to Seattle after the NBA 's Board of Governors rejected investor Chris Hansen 's bid to relocate the team . The new owners intend to keep the team in Sacramento . On May 28 , the NBA Board of Governors unanimously approved the sale , ending several years of efforts by other cities to take possession and move the Kings out of Sacramento . On May 31 , 2013 , the Kings closed escrow , finalizing the sale to the Ranadivé group at a record valuation of $534 million , beginning a new era for the franchise . Plans were already underway to move forward on an arena , as the Downtown Plaza was reportedly being sold to the Sacramento ownership group . A month later , on July 30 , Turner Construction was selected to be the builder of the arena .
