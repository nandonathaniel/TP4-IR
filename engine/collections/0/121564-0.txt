In the flowering plants , an ovary is a part of the female reproductive organ of the flower or gynoecium . Specifically , it is the part of the pistil which holds the ovule ( s ) and is located above or below or at the point of connection with the base of the petals and sepals . The pistil may be made up of one carpel or of several fused carpels ( e.g. dicarpel or tricarpel ) , and therefore the ovary can contain part of one carpel or parts of several fused carpels . Above the ovary is the style and the stigma , which is where the pollen lands and germinates to grow down through the style to the ovary , and , for each individual pollen grain , to fertilize one individual ovule . Some wind pollinated flowers have much reduced and modified ovaries .
