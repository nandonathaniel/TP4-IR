The cardiac cycle refers to the sequence of events in which the heart contracts and relaxes with every heartbeat . The period of time during which the ventricles contract , forcing blood out into the aorta and main pulmonary artery , is known as systole , while the period during which the ventricles relax and refill with blood is known as diastole . The atria and ventricles work in concert , so in systole when the ventricles are contracting , the atria are relaxed and collecting blood . When the ventricles are relaxed in diastole , the atria contract to pump blood to the ventricles . This coordination ensures blood is pumped efficiently to the body .
