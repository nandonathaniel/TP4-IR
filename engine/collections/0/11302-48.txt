Upon receipt of a qualified written request , a mortgage servicer is required to take certain steps , each of which is subject to certain deadlines . The servicer must acknowledge receipt of the request within 5 business days . The servicer then has 30 business days ( from the request ) to take action on the request . The servicer has to either provide a written notification that the error has been corrected , or provide a written explanation as to why the servicer believes the account is correct . Either way , the servicer has to provide the name and telephone number of a person with whom the borrower can discuss the matter . The servicer can not provide information to any credit agency regarding any overdue payment during the 60 - day period .
