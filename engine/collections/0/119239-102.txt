In 1997 , Home Depot entered the Chilean and Argentine markets . While the venture was viewed with great optimism by founders Bernard Marcus and Arthur Blank , it eventually proved unprofitable . In October 2001 , Chilean partners Falabella bought out Home Depot 's share of the five Chilean Home Center stores and rebranded them Home Store . In 2003 , after merging with Sodimac , all stores adopted that brand . The company has since expanded across Latin America very profitably and successfully . It 's currently the N ° 1 Home Improvement company in South America . In 2002 , Argentina 's Home Depots were bought out by Chilean company Cencosud and rebranded Easy stores , a company that has also expanded across South America . It 's currently the N ° 2 Home Improvement company in South America .
