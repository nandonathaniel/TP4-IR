Tobey is a former race car driver who owns his late father 's garage , Marshall Performance Motors , in Mount Kisco , New York where he and his friends tune performance cars . Struggling to make ends meet , he and his crew participate in street races after hours . After a race , Tobey 's former rival Dino Brewster conscripts them into completing the build of a rare Ford Shelby Mustang worked on by the late Carroll Shelby , in exchange for 25 % of the car 's estimated selling price of $3 million . The completed Mustang is displayed for auction at a party in New York City . Tobey and Dino meet Julia , an English car broker whose client , Bill Ingram , wants to purchase the car if they can prove it will drive over 230 mph as Tobey claims . Despite Dino 's objections , Tobey takes the Mustang to a local race track and successfully drives it at 234 mph , convincing Ingram to purchase it for $2.7 million .
