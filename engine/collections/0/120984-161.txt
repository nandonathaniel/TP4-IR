A `` MouseOver '' exploit occurred on September 21 , 2010 , when an XSS Worm became active on Twitter . When a user held the mouse cursor over blacked - out parts of a tweet , the worm within the script would automatically open links and re-post itself on the reader 's account . The exploit was then re-used to post pop - up ads and links to pornographic sites . The origin of the worm is unclear , but Pearce H. Delphin ( known on Twitter as @ zzap ) and a Scandinavian developer , Magnus Holm , both claim to have modified a related exploit found by another user ( possibly Masato Kinugawa ) who was using it to create coloured Tweets . Kinugawa , a Japanese developer , reported the XSS vulnerability to Twitter on August 14 . Later , when he found it was exploitable again , he created the account ' RainbowTwtr ' and used it to post coloured messages . Delphin says he exposed the security flaw by tweeting a JavaScript function for `` onMouseOver '' , and Holm later created and posted the XSS Worm that automatically re-tweeted itself . Security firm Sophos reported that the virus was spread by people doing it for `` fun and games '' , but noted it could be exploited by cybercriminals . Twitter issued a statement on their status blog at 13 : 50 UTC that `` The exploit is fully patched . '' Twitter representative Carolyn Penner said no charges would be pressed .
