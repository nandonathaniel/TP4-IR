A good stock horse is on the small side , generally under 15.2 hands ( 62 inches ) tall at the withers and often under 1000 pounds , with a short back , sturdy legs and strong muscling , particularly in the hindquarters . While a steer roping horse may need to be larger and weigh more in order to hold a heavy adult cow , bull or steer on a rope , a smaller , quick horse is needed for herding activities such as cutting or calf roping . The horse has to be intelligent , calm under pressure and have a certain degree of ' cow sense '' -- the ability to anticipate the movement and behavior of cattle .
