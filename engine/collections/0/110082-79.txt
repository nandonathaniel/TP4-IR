This relationship between magnetic fields and currents is extremely important , for it led to Michael Faraday 's invention of the electric motor in 1821 . Faraday 's homopolar motor consisted of a permanent magnet sitting in a pool of mercury . A current was allowed through a wire suspended from a pivot above the magnet and dipped into the mercury . The magnet exerted a tangential force on the wire , making it circle around the magnet for as long as the current was maintained .
