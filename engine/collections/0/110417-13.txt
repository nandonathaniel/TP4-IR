As of 2012 there are a few HOV lanes in operation in Europe . The main reason for this is that , in general , European cities have better public transport services and fewer high - capacity multi-lane urban motorways than do the U.S. and Canada . However , at around 1.3 persons per vehicle , average car occupancy is relatively low in most European cities . The emphasis in Europe has been on providing bus lanes and on - street bus priority measures . The first HOV lane in Europe was opened in the Netherlands in October 1993 and operated until August 1994 . Its facility was a 7 km ( 4.3 mi ) barrier - separated HOV 3 + on the A1 near Amsterdam . The facility did not attract enough users to overcome public criticism and was converted to a reversible lane open to general traffic after the judge in a legal test case ruled that Dutch traffic law lacked the concept of a car pool and thus that the principle of equality was violated .
