The Sahel ( / səˈhɛl / ) is the ecoclimatic and biogeographic zone of transition in Africa between the Sahara to the north and the Sudanian Savanna to the south . Having a semi-arid climate , it stretches across the south - central latitudes of Northern Africa between the Atlantic Ocean and the Red Sea . The name is derived from the Arabic word sāḥil ( ساحل , Arabic pronunciation : ( ˈsaːħil ) ) meaning `` coast '' or `` shore '' in a figurative sense ( in reference to the southern edge of the vast Sahara ) , while the name Swahili means `` coastal ( dweller ) '' in a literal sense .
