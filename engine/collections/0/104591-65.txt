The Gilbert Islands ( now known as Kiribati ) and the Ellice Islands ( now known as Tuvalu ) came under Britain 's sphere of influence in the late 19th century . The Ellice Islands were administered as British protectorate by a Resident Commissioner from 1892 to 1916 as part of the British Western Pacific Territories ( BWPT ) , and later as part of the Gilbert and Ellice Islands colony from 1916 to 1974 .
