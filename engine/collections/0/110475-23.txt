The Cabinet 's December 2010 decision to scrap the Tamil translation of the anthem ( which was not subsequently enacted ) caused much furore in Sri Lanka . Later , the government denied allegations that the Tamil translation was to be abolished . The Presidential Secretariat has stated that there was no basis to the media report and follow up reports which intimated the same . Nevertheless , an unofficial ban on the Tamil version came into being as fearful public officials in Tamil speaking areas stopped using the Tamil version or blocked attempts to use it . The Sri Lankan Army forcefully stopped any use of the Tamil version and taught school children to sing only the Sinhala version .
