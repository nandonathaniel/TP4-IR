CGT operates by having net gains treated as taxable income in the tax year an asset is sold or otherwise disposed of . If an asset is held for at least 1 year then any gain is first discounted by 50 % for individual taxpayers , or by 33.3 % for superannuation funds . Capital losses can be offset against capital gains , and net capital losses in a tax year may be carried forward indefinitely . Capital losses can not be offset against normal income .
