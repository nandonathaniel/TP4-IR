Thus , the City of Ji , ceded to the Liao as Youzhou , continued as Nanjing in what is today the southwest part of urban Beijing . Some of the oldest landmarks in southern Xicheng ( formerly Xuanwu ) and Fengtai Districts date to the Liao era . They include Sanmiao Road , one of the oldest streets in Beijing and the Niujie Mosque , founded in 996 , and the Tianning Temple , built from 1100 to 1119 . Under Liao rule , the population inside the walled city grew from 22,000 in 938 to 150,000 in 1113 ( and the population of the surrounding region grew from 100,000 to 583,000 ) as large numbers of Khitan , Xi , Shiwei and Balhae from the north and Han from the south migrated to the city .
