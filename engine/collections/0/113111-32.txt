After the destruction of the temple in 70 AD offerings could no longer be brought to the Temple and the festival started to have a different focus , the giving of the law on Sinai . This feast eventually received the name Pentecost from the Koine Greek word Pentekoste meaning fiftieth day . The actual mention of fifty days comes from Leviticus 23 : 16 .
