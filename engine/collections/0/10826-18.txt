The perimeter structure was constructed with extensive use of prefabricated modular pieces , which consisted of three columns , three stories tall , connected by spandrel plates . The perimeter columns had a square cross section , 14 inches ( 36 cm ) on a side , and were constructed of welded steel plate . The thickness of the plates and grade of structural steel varied over the height of the tower , ranging from 36,000 to 100,000 pounds per square inch ( 260 to 670 MPa ) . The strength of the steel and thickness of the steel plates decreased with height because they were required to support lesser amounts of building mass on higher floors . The tube - frame design required 40 percent less structural steel than conventional building designs . From the 7th floor to the ground level , and down to the foundation , the columns were spaced 10 feet ( 3 m ) apart . All columns were placed on bedrock , which , unlike that in Midtown Manhattan , where the bedrock is shallow , is at 65 -- 85 feet ( 20 -- 26 m ) below the surface .
