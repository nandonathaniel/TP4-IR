The high mountains , including the Sierra Nevada , the Cascade Range , and the Klamath Mountains , have a mountain climate with snow in winter and mild to moderate heat in summer . Ski resorts at Lake Tahoe , Mammoth Lakes , and Mount Shasta routinely receive over 10 feet ( 3.0 m ) of snow in a season , and some years , substantially more -- leading , for example , to annual ski races on the Fourth of July .
