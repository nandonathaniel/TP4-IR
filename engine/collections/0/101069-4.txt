The rock underlying the Appalachian Plateau consists of a base of Precambrian rock , overlain by sedimentary rock from the Paleozoic Era . On top of the basement is a thick layer , approximately 20,000 feet , of a mixture of Cambrian , Ordovician , and Middle Silurian rock . This rock consists of shale , siltstone , and sandstone . Above this layer is the Upper Silurian evaporate basin , or basin of chemically formed sedimentary rocks . The Plateau fold belt consists of structurally complex Paleozoic strata which were thrust faulted over the younger evaporates .
