In the world of commerce , Srivijaya rose rapidly to be a far - flung empire controlling the two passages between India and China , namely the Sunda Strait from Palembang and the Malacca Strait from Kedah . Arab accounts state that the empire of the Srivijayan Maharaja was so vast that the swiftest vessel would not have been able to travel round all its islands within two years . The islands the accounts referred to produced camphor , aloes , sandal - wood , spices like cloves , nutmegs , cardamom and cubebs , as well as ivory , gold and tin , all of which equalled the wealth of the Maharaja to any king in India .
