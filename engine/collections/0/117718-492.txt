The U.S. government had two purposes when making land agreements with Native Americans : to open it up more land for white settlement , and to ease tensions between whites and Native Americans by forcing the Native Americans to use the land in the same way as did the whites -- for subsistence farms . The government used a variety of strategies to achieve these goals ; many treaties required Native Americans to become farmers in order to keep their land . Government officials often did not translate the documents which Native Americans were forced to sign , and native chiefs often had little or no idea what they were signing .
