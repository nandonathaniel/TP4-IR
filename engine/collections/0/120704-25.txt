According to Robert L. Green ( 1996 ) , the mirror effect occurs when stimuli that are easy to recognize as old when old are also easy to recognize as new when new in recognition . The mirror effect refers to the consistency of the recognition of the stimuli in memory . In other words , they are easier to remember when you have previously studied the stimuli i.e. , old , and easier to reject when you have not seen them before , i.e. new . Murray Glanzer and John K. Adams first described the mirror effect in 1985 . The mirror effect has been effective in tests of associative recognition , measures of latency responses , discriminations of order , and others ( Glanzer & Adams , 1985 ) .
