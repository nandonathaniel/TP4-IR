Roger Beckermann 's orange Lamborghini Miura in the opening scene is actually two cars . The first was a Miura P400 that was sold as new afterwards . In 2015 it was found and verified , and now belongs to Cheshire Classic Cars . The car tumbled down the chasm by the Mafia bulldozer was another Miura that had been in a serious accident and was not roadworthy .
