The motion of the fluid is sustained by convection , motion driven by buoyancy . The temperature increases towards the center of the Earth , and the higher temperature of the fluid lower down makes it buoyant . This buoyancy is enhanced by chemical separation : As the core cools , some of the molten iron solidifies and is plated to the inner core . In the process , lighter elements are left behind in the fluid , making it lighter . This is called compositional convection . A Coriolis effect , caused by the overall planetary rotation , tends to organize the flow into rolls aligned along the north - south polar axis .
