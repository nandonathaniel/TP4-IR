Matins of Great and Holy Saturday is , in parish practice , held on Friday evening . The service is known as the `` Orthros of Lamentations at the Tomb '' , because the majority of the service is composed of the clergy and faithful gathered around the tomb , chanting the `` Lamentations '' interspersed between the verses of Kathisma XVII ( Psalm 118 ) . At a certain point the priest sprinkles the tomb with rose petals and rose water . Near the end of the service , the Epitaphios is carried in a candlelit procession around the outside of the church as the faithful sing the Trisagion .
