Sportswriters in the early 20th century began referring to the Dodgers as the `` Bums '' , in reference to the team 's fans and possibly because of the `` street character '' nature of Jack Dawkins , the `` Artful Dodger '' in Charles Dickens ' Oliver Twist . Newspaper cartoonist Willard Mullin used a drawing of famous clown Emmett Kelly to depict `` Dem Bums '' : the team would later use `` Weary Willie '' in promotional images , and Kelly himself was a club mascot during the 1950s .
