Bach wrote virtuoso music for specific instruments , as well as music independent of instrumentation . For instance , the Sonatas and partitas for solo violin are considered the pinnacle of what has been written for this instrument , only within reach of accomplished players : the music fits the instrument , pushing it to the full scale of its possibilities , requiring virtuosity of the player , but without bravura . Notwithstanding that the music and the instrument seem inseparable , Bach made transcriptions for other instruments of some pieces of this collection . Similarly , for the cello suites , the virtuoso music seems tailored for the instrument , the best of what is on offer for it , yet Bach made an arrangement for lute of one of these suites . Likewise for much of his most virtuoso keyboard music . Bach exploited the capabilities of an instrument to the fullest while keeping the core of such music independent of the instrument on which it is performed .
