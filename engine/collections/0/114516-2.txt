In dentistry , the configuration factor was first introduced by Davidson CL , 1986 , and later quantitavly extended Feilzer et al. in 1987 and refers to the number of bonded surfaces to the number of un-bonded surfaces in a dental restoration . For example , for a class I preparation there would be 5 bonded surfaces and only 1 un-bonded surface ; the net result would be a c - factor of 5 . With an increasing C factor the developing curing contraction stresses of bonded restorations ( resin composites ) increases too ( Feilzer et al. 1987 ) . The developing curing contraction in a bonded restoration generate stress on the bonded interface that are in competition with the developing bond strength of the setting restorative to the cavity surfaces , which may result in ( partial ) debonding , marginal leakage and post-operative pain ( Davidson et al. 1984 ) .
