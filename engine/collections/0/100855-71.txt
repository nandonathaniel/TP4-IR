The Civil Rights Act of 1875 , introduced by Charles Sumner and Benjamin F. Butler , stipulated a guarantee that everyone , regardless of race , color , or previous condition of servitude , was entitled to the same treatment in public accommodations , such as inns , public transportation , theaters , and other places of recreation . This Act had little effect . An 1883 Supreme Court decision ruled that the act was unconstitutional in some respects , saying Congress was not afforded control over private persons or corporations . With white southern Democrats forming a solid voting bloc in Congress , due to having outsize power from keeping seats apportioned for the total population in the South ( although hundreds of thousands had been disenfranchised ) , Congress did not pass another civil rights law until 1957 .
