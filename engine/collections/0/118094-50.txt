In some urban areas , like 462 for Marion County , Indiana , the three - digit prefix will often exist in one county , while , in rural and most suburban areas , the prefix will exist in multiple counties ; for example , the neighboring 476 prefix is found in part or entirely in six counties : Gibson , Pike , Posey , Spencer , Vanderburgh , and Warrick . In some cases , an urban county may have more than one prefix . This is the case with Allen ( 467 , 468 ) , Lake ( 464 , 463 ) , St. Joseph ( 465 , 466 ) , and Vanderburgh ( 476 , 477 ) Counties . Cities like Chicago , Houston , Los Angeles , and New York City have multiple prefixes within their city limits . In some cases , these may be served from the same SCF , such as in San Diego County , California , where the three - digit prefixes 919 and 920 are used for suburban and rural communities , and 921 for the city of San Diego itself , although all three are processed through the same SCF facility .
