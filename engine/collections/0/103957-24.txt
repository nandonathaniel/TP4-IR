The Humber Bridge , near Kingston upon Hull , England , is a 2,220 - metre ( 7,280 ft ) single - span suspension bridge , which opened to traffic on 24 June 1981 . When it was opened , it was the longest of its type in the world ; it was not surpassed until 1998 , with the completion of the Akashi Kaiky≈ç Bridge , and it is now the eighth - longest . It spans the Humber , ( the estuary formed by the rivers Trent and Ouse ) , between Barton - upon - Humber on the south bank and Hessle on the north bank , thereby connecting the East Riding of Yorkshire and North Lincolnshire . When it opened in 1981 , both sides of the bridge were in the non-metropolitan county of Humberside , until its dissolution in 1996 . The bridge can be seen for miles around and from as far as Patrington in the East Riding of Yorkshire . It is a Grade I listed building .
