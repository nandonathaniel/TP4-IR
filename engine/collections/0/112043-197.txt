In 1993 , the show 's staff selected 30 episodes to split into 60 one - hour segments for The Mystery Science Theater Hour . The repackaged series ' first - run airings of these half - shows ran from November 1993 to July 1994 . Reruns continued through December 1994 , and it was syndicated to local stations from September 1995 to September 1996 , allowing stations to run the series in a one - hour slot , or the original two hour version . MST3K returned to television for the first time in ten years in July 2014 , when RetroTV began broadcasting the series on Saturday nights , with an encore on Sunday evenings . The following year , they started showing on PBS member stations . In the summer of 2016 , Sinclair Broadcast Group and MGM 's joint venture sci - fi network Comet picked up the series for a weekly Sunday night double - run ; by coincidence , Sinclair 's CW station , WUCW in the Twin Cities , which had originated the series when it was KTMA - TV , carries Comet on their second subchannel , returning the series to its original home for the first time in 27 years . As of June 1 2018 , the show no longer aired on the sub-channel network Comet .
