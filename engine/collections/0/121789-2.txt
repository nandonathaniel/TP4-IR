In the context of sewing , an appliqué refers to a needlework technique in which patterns or representational scenes are created by the attachment of smaller pieces of fabric to a larger piece of contrasting color or texture . It is particularly suitable for work which is to be seen from a distance , such as in banner - making . A famous example of appliqué is the Hastings Embroidery .
