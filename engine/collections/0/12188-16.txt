In December 1773 , a new group calling itself the Sons of Liberty issued and distributed a declaration in New York City called the Association of the Sons of Liberty in New York , which formally stated that they were opposed to the Tea Act and that anyone who assisted in the execution of the act was `` an enemy to the liberties of America '' and that `` whoever shall transgress any of these resolutions , we will not deal with , or employ , or have any connection with him '' .
