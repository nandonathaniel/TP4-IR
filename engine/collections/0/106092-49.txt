Tank thermostats are not a reliable guide to the internal temperature of the tank . Gas - fired water tanks may have no temperature calibration shown . An electric thermostat shows the temperature at the elevation of the thermostat , but water lower in the tank can be considerably cooler . An outlet thermometer is a better indication of water temperature .
