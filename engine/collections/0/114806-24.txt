The upper photic zone of the ocean is filled with particle organic matter ( POM ) and is quite productive , especially in the coastal areas and the upwelling areas . However , most POM is small and light . It may take hundreds , or even thousands of years for these particles to settle through the water column into the deep ocean . This time delay is long enough for the particles to be remineralized and taken up by organisms in the food webs .
