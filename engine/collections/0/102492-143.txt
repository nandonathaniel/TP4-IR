On 3 August representatives from the `` Warsaw Five '' and Czechoslovakia met in Bratislava and signed the Bratislava Declaration . The declaration affirmed unshakable fidelity to Marxism - Leninism and proletarian internationalism and declared an implacable struggle against `` bourgeois '' ideology and all `` anti-socialist '' forces . The Soviet Union expressed its intention to intervene in a Warsaw Pact country if a `` bourgeois '' system -- a pluralist system of several political parties representing different factions of the capitalist class -- was ever established . After the Bratislava conference , the Soviet Army left Czechoslovak territory but remained along its borders .
