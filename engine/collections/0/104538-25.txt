Like the other water plants , hydrilla reproduces rapidly . Although it is not free floating , it grows quickly to the water surface , and if it breaks apart it can form new plants from fragments . It clogs open waterways , blocks sunlight , lowers dissolved oxygen , and otherwise changes water chemistry . Hydrilla also harms fisheries and zooplankton populations . The Kissimmee Chain of Lakes , including Kissimmee , Hatchineha , and Tohopekaliga , have been severely infested with hydrilla . It is managed by being physically removed , and taking all pieces of plants from waterways is integral to avoiding future infestations . The efficacy of herbicides is dependent upon a variety of factors , but their application is credited with , if not eliminating hydrilla in the Kissimmee Chain of Lakes , at least keeping it to a manageable and acceptable presence . Sometimes hydrilla is treated by the release of grass carp ( Ctenopharyngodon idella ) that eat it . Carp , however , may also eat native vegetation , so they are released only where their impact would not be detrimental .
