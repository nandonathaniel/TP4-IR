The Cutie Mark Crusaders open a day camp where `` blank flank '' foals may try new activities and discover their special talents . Rumble , the younger brother of Wonderbolt Thunderlane , refuses to participate and reveals his desire to remain a blank flank , as he is convinced that cutie marks limit ponies to only performing their talents . He quickly rallies the other campers to his side , splitting off into a new camp where they can avoid doing anything that would produce a cutie mark , which quickly bores the campers . The Crusaders learn from Thunderlane that Rumble does not fear being labeled , but rather getting a cutie mark that could potentially keep him from following his dreams of becoming a Wonderbolt himself . The three invite Thunderlane to participate in the camp 's activities with the campers and prove how he excels in other things besides flying , helping Rumble overcome his fear of trying new things .
