'' While codes for fire ( red ) and medical emergency ( blue ) were similar in 90 % of California hospitals queried , 47 different codes were used for infant abduction and 61 for combative person . In light of this , HASC published a handbook titled `` Healthcare Facility Emergency Codes : A Guide for Code Standardization '' listing various codes and has strongly urged hospitals to voluntarily implement the revised codes . In 2003 , Maryland mandated that all acute hospitals in the state have uniform codes . In 2008 , the Oregon Association of Hospitals & Health Systems , Oregon Patient Safety Commission , and Washington State Hospital Association formed a taskforce to standardize emergency code calls under the leadership of the Dr. Lawrence Schecter , Chief Medical Officer , Providence Regional Medical Center Everett . After both states had conducted a survey from all hospital members , the taskforce found many hospitals used the same code for fire ( code Red ) ; however , there were tremendous variations existed for codes representing respiratory and cardiac arrest , infant and child abduction , and combative person . After deliberations and decisions , the taskforce suggested the following as the Hospital Emergency Code : Code Blue : Heart or Respiration Stops ( An adult , child , or infant 's heart has stopped or they are not breathing . ) Code Red : Fire Code Orange : Hazardous Spills ( A hazardous material spill or release ; Unsafe exposure to spill . ) Code Silver : Weapon or Hostage Situation Code Grey : Combative Person ( Combative or abusive behavior by patients , families , visitors , staff or physicians ) If a weapon is involved `` CODE SILVER '' should be called . Amber Alert : Infant / Child Abduction Internal Triage : Internal Emergency ( Internal emergency in multiple departments including : Bomb or bomb threat ; Computer network down ; Major plumbing problems ; and Power or telephone outage . ) External Triage : External Disaster ( External emergencies impacting hospital including : Mass casualties ; Severe weather ; Massive power outages ; and Nuclear , biological , and chemical accidents ) Rapid Response Team : Medical Team Needed at Bedside ( A patient 's medical condition is declining and needs an emergency medical team at the bedside ) Prior to heart or respiration stopping Code Clear : Announced when emergency is over In 2015 , the South Carolina Hospital Association formed a work group to develop plain language standardization code recommendations . Abolishing all color codes was suggested .
