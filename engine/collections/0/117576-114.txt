At the meeting , Jon and Daenerys present a wight , convincing the Lannisters of the White Walkers ' existence . After some persuasion from Tyrion , Cersei declares that she will order the Lannister forces north to aid in the war against the army of the dead . However , when Jaime begins organising the march north , she reveals to him that she was lying and will not intervene until either of the two enemies -- dead and living -- are defeated ( conveniently forgetting or disregarding the fact that if the dead win their numbers will increase even more ) . Outraged by Cersei 's shortsightedness and selfishness , Jaime leaves Cersei 's side and rides north alone .
