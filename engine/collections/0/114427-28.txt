The change has been questioned by Republicans including Dave Camp , chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee and Orrin Hatch , who requested further details from HHS over concerns that the memo would remove the main focus of PRWORA . Mitt Romney attacked the measure , saying that Obama was `` gutting welfare reform '' . However , PolitiFact stated that Romney 's claim was `` not accurate '' and `` inflames old resentments '' , giving it a `` Pants on Fire '' rating . CNN also reported that assertions that Obama was `` taking the work requirement off the table '' was false . In response to Republican criticism , Kathleen Sebelius , the Secretary of Health and Human Services said that states , including some with Republican governors , had previously asked Congress to allow waivers .
