The population of Bhutan had been estimated based on the reported figure of about 1 million in the 1970s when the country had joined the United Nations and precise statistics were lacking . Thus , using the annual increase rate of 2 -- 3 % , the most population estimates were around 2 million in the year 2000 . A national census was carried out in 2005 and it turned out that the population was 672,425 . Consequently , United Nations Population Division reduced its estimation of the country 's population in the 2006 revision for the whole period from 1950 to 2050 .
