The federal Conservative Party of Canada has no provincial wings and none of the current provincial Progressive Conservative Parties are formally linked with the federal party as they all predate the 2003 establishment of the federal party , which resulted in the formal disbanding of the federal Progressive Conservative Party of Canada . Some provincial parties ( such as Alberta ) formally broke off links with the federal party prior to the merger .
