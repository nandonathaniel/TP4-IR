Fewer and fewer young men in Britain were interested in joining , and the continuing distrust of Indians resulted in a declining base in terms of quality and quantity . By 1945 Indians were numerically dominant in the ICS and at issue was loyal divided between the Empire and independence . The finances of the Raj depended on land taxes , and these became problematic in the 1930s . Epstein argues that after 1919 it became harder and harder to collect the land revenue . The Raj 's suppression of civil disobedience after 1934 temporarily increased the power of the revenue agents but after 1937 they were forced by the new Congress - controlled provincial governments to hand back confiscated land . Again the outbreak of war strengthened them , in the face of the Quit India movement the revenue collectors had to rely on military force and by 1946 -- 47 direct British control was rapidly disappearing in much of the countryside .
