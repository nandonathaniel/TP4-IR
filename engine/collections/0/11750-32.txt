The spectral class of a star indicates its photospheric temperature , which ( for main - sequence stars ) correlates to overall mass . The appropriate spectral range for `` HabStars '' is considered to be `` late F '' or `` G '' , to `` mid-K '' . This corresponds to temperatures of a little more than 7,000 K down to a little more than 4,000 K ( 6,700 ° C to 3,700 ° C ) ; the Sun , a G2 star at 5,777 K , is well within these bounds . This spectral range probably accounts for between 5 % and 10 % of stars in the local Milky Way galaxy . `` Middle - class '' stars of this sort have a number of characteristics considered important to planetary habitability :
