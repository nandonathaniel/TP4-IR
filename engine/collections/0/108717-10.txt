Basketball also features disqualification , also known as fouling out . A player who commits a certain number of personal fouls in a game ( 5 or 6 in most leagues ) , is removed from the game and is said to have `` fouled out '' . Unlike ejection , disqualification is not considered a punitive action but rather a natural consequence of a very physical sport with many instances of contact . Disqualified players are permitted to remain on the bench with the team ( instead of being sent to the locker room , as with an ejected player ) and are not subject to any further penalties ( such as fines or suspensions ) ; they can resume play in their next game . In the NBA , a technical foul ( which does not count towards suspension or ejection ) is also assessed for re-entering a game after fouling out of a game in emergency situations listed in Rule 3 , Section I when a team is reduced to five players . Once that occurs , a technical foul is charged if a player remains in the game after his sixth or subsequent foul , or as the last player to foul out , re-enters the game in case of injury to an eligible player that must be removed .
