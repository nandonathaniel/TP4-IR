Soon after the release of the Chevrolet Avalanche , customers began to notice cosmetic problems with the cladding on their vehicles . Over time exposure to heat and sunlight would cause a chalky faded appearance . It was especially noticeable on the cargo bed panels , and sail - panel windows where `` Zebra Striping '' would appear . Customer reaction to this problem resulted in General Motors agreeing to a one time treatment of a product called ArmorDillo . This product would temporarily restore the cladding for a period of about 6 months . After that it would wear off then need to be re-applied . Realizing this was not a permanent solution , GM , together with Gatorback Coatings , developed a coating that could be applied to the cladding to restore it to a like - new shine . This product was designed to etch into the plastic and bond a new layer of tinted acrylic over the faded plastic . Customers within the 3yr / 36,000 original factory warranty could go to their dealership to have it restored under their original warranty under GM TSB : 04 - 08 - 111 - 001C . General Motors did not use side body cladding on the second generation model . General Motors has also identified the original source of the faded cladding .
