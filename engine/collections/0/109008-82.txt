As part of its operational definition of the pH scale , the IUPAC defines a series of buffer solutions across a range of pH values ( often denoted with NBS or NIST designation ) . These solutions have a relatively low ionic strength ( ≈ 0.1 ) compared to that of seawater ( ≈ 0.7 ) , and , as a consequence , are not recommended for use in characterizing the pH of seawater , since the ionic strength differences cause changes in electrode potential . To resolve this problem , an alternative series of buffers based on artificial seawater was developed . This new series resolves the problem of ionic strength differences between samples and the buffers , and the new pH scale is referred to as the ' total scale ' , often denoted as pH . The total scale was defined using a medium containing sulfate ions . These ions experience protonation , H + SO ⇌ HSO , such that the total scale includes the effect of both protons ( free hydrogen ions ) and hydrogen sulfate ions :
