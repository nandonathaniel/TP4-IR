Things like the `` Lincoln Memorial '' would be placed in so that everyone knows that the building will in fact appear to be the Lincoln Memorial , which is what my changes suggested . In fact , my changes do n't change the truth value of the sentence at all -- the Lincoln Memorial will ALWAYS `` appear to be '' the Lincoln Memorial . The second change I made did n't change anything at all , so I 'm changing that since you do n't seem to have any dispute with it at all . Ommnomnomgulp ( talk ) 16 : 54 , 10 February 2016 ( UTC )
