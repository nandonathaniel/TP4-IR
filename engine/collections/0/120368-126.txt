Nazi Germany had at its disposal fifty divisions in France and the Low Countries , with another eighteen stationed in Denmark and Norway . Fifteen divisions were in the process of formation in Germany . Combat losses throughout the war , particularly on the Eastern Front , meant that the Germans no longer had a pool of able young men from which to draw . German soldiers were now on average six years older than their Allied counterparts . Many in the Normandy area were Ostlegionen ( eastern legions ) -- conscripts and volunteers from Russia , Mongolia , and other areas of the Soviet Union . They were provided mainly with unreliable captured equipment and lacked motorised transport . Many German units were under strength .
