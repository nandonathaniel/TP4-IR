For much of the 20th century most scholars agreed that the five books of the Pentateuch -- Genesis , Exodus , Leviticus , Numbers and Deuteronomy -- came from four sources , the Yahwist , the Elohist , the Deuteronomist and the Priestly source , each telling the same basic story , and joined together by various editors . Since the 1970s there has been a revolution in scholarship : the Elohist source is now widely regarded as no more than a variation on the Yahwist , while the Priestly source is increasingly seen not as a document but as a body of revisions and expansions to the Yahwist ( or `` non-Priestly '' ) material . ( The Deuteronomistic source does not appear in Genesis ) .
