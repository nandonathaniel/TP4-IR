Star Alliance developed a `` regional '' concept in 2004 , which helped it penetrate markets with participation by smaller regional carriers . Regional Star Alliance members had to be sponsored by an alliance member . The alliance no longer designates airlines as `` regional '' members , now referring to its 27 airlines as `` members '' .
