The law implies that mass can neither be created nor destroyed , although it may be rearranged in space , or the entities associated with it may be changed in form . For example , in chemical reactions , the mass of the chemical components before the reaction is equal to the mass of the components after the reaction . Thus , during any chemical reaction and low - energy thermodynamic processes in an isolated system , the total mass of the reactants , or starting materials , must be equal to the mass of the products .
