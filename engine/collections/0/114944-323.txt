In March 1946 , despite repeated requests from Chiang , the Soviet Red Army under the command of Marshal Malinovsky continued to delay pulling out of Manchuria , while Malinovsky secretly told the CPC forces to move in behind them , which led to full - scale war for the control of the Northeast . These favorable conditions also facilitated many changes inside the Communist leadership : the more radical hard - line faction who wanted full military bloodshed and warfare to take - over China finally gained the upper hand and defeated the careful opportunists . Prior to giving control to Communist leaders , on March 27 Soviet diplomats requested a joint venture of industrial development with the Nationalist Party in Manchuria .
