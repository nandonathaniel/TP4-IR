On October 12 , 2016 , Grand Valley State University announced that it had overtaken the University of Michigan as the record holder for all - time college football winning percentage ( for schools with over 500 games played , not taking division into consideration ) . The winning percentage in the Division I Subdivisions for the Notre Dame Fighting Irish football is (. 712 ) , not (. 730 ) as noted in error on the most victories chart . As well , the order of the list is more accurate to reflect the actual victory , loss and tie counts ' as performed ' on the field , eg : Michigan 935 , Alabama 907 , Ohio State 898 , Notre Dame 893 , etc ... followed with the footnote to then reflect a penalty later discredited ( # ) victories .
