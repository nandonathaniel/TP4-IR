Before the decision to keep the Sky Cabin at Knott 's Berry Farm and to place its WindSeeker elsewhere , their WindSeeker was to have the same color scheme as others . Also , instead of there being the red `` UFO '' on the top of the tower , original promotional materials show that a large purple `` K '' was to be placed on the top of the ride . The ride opened in mid-August 2011 after three months of delays . In late 2011 , Fast Lane became available on the Knott 's Berry Farm WindSeeker . On September 7 , the ride stalled for nearly three hours , and on September 19 , it stalled again at the top of the tower for three and a half hours . Both incidents prompted Cedar Fair to close all other WindSeekers until an internal investigation is completed . After the investigation was complete , all WindSeekers reopened except Knott 's ' model which was dismantled by December 11 , 2013 to be sent to Worlds of Fun .
