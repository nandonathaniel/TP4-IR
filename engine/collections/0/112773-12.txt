Alternating current is rarely used with GMAW ; instead , direct current is employed and the electrode is generally positively charged . Since the anode tends to have a greater heat concentration , this results in faster melting of the feed wire , which increases weld penetration and welding speed . The polarity can be reversed only when special emissive - coated electrode wires are used , but since these are not popular , a negatively charged electrode is rarely employed .
