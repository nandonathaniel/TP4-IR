Paul Cornell , Martin Day , and Keith Topping wrote of the serial in The Discontinuity Guide ( 1995 ) , `` A little masterpiece , often undeservedly forgotten by the weight of the surrounding stories . A magnificent cast shake every ounce of subtlety and invention from the script . '' In The Television Companion ( 1998 ) , David J. Howe and Stephen James Walker praised the casting and use of the image of the Doctor 's face , calling it `` unsettling '' . While it was overall an `` impressive tale that manages to intrigue and delight '' , they noted that the Tesh made `` little impression '' and the conclusion to the story was `` somewhat unlikely '' . In 2010 , Patrick Mulkern of Radio Times was more negative , calling the episodes `` stagnant at best and for the most part knuckle - gnawingly dull '' , with shortcomings in every area of production . He felt that the two `` saving graces '' were the cliffhangers to the first and third episodes and Jameson as Leela . DVD Talk reviewer John Sinnott gave The Face of Evil four out of five stars , praising Baker , Leela , and the story 's social commentary on religion . Dave Golder , writing for SFX , noted its more adult tone and called it `` strong , compelling stuff '' . In 2010 , Charlie Jane Anders of io9 listed the cliffhanger to the first episode -- in which Doctor 's face is revealed to be that of the Evil One -- as one of the greatest cliffhangers in the history of Doctor Who .
