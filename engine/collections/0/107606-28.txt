Queen Victoria had instructed the War Office to strike a new medal that would not recognise birth or class . The medal was meant to be a simple decoration that would be highly prized and eagerly sought after by those in the military services . To maintain its simplicity , Queen Victoria , under the guidance of Prince Albert , vetoed the suggestion that the award be called The Military Order of Victoria and instead suggested the name Victoria Cross . The original warrant stated that the Victoria Cross would only be awarded to officers and men who had served in the presence of the enemy and had performed some signal act of valour or devotion . The first ceremony was held on 26 June 1857 at which Queen Victoria invested 62 of the 111 Crimean recipients in a ceremony in Hyde Park , London .
