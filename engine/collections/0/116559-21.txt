In the strictest sense , `` the Strip '' refers only to the stretch of Las Vegas Boulevard that is roughly between Sahara Avenue and Russell Road , a distance of 4.2 miles ( 6.8 km ) . However , the term is often used to refer not only to the road but also to the various casinos and resorts that line the road , and even to properties that are not on the road but in proximity . Phrases such as Strip Area , Resort Corridor or Resort District are sometimes used to indicate a larger geographical area , including properties 1 mile ( 1.6 km ) or more away from Las Vegas Boulevard , such as the Hard Rock , Rio , Palms , and Hooters casinos .
