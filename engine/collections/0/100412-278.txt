In 2009 , Phillip III returned , revealing he staged his death because of all the stress in his life and to keep his homosexuality a secret . During his absence , Phillip sent his friend , Cane Ashby , to Genoa City as a replacement son of sorts for his mother and to fill the void he left behind for his family . When their ruse was discovered , Phillip attempted to form a relationship with his son , Chance , but decided to return to Australia shortly after . In September 2010 , Phillip 's son , Chance , was accidentally shot `` dead '' by his maternal half - brother , Ronan Malloy . Chance was pronounced dead at the scene . On September 17 , 2010 , it was revealed that Chance faked his death . Only Nina , Phillip , Ronan , Katherine and Christine must know that he was still `` alive '' , as he was going into the Witness Protection Program . Phillip then left to go back home to Australia after Chance left to go into the Witness Protection Program . In May 2012 , Jill temporarily moved to Australia to help Phillip recover after knee surgery .
