Britain had already passed an Irish Home Rule Act in 1914 , suspended for the war 's duration . However the 1916 Easter Rising in Dublin had led to increased support for the more radical Sinn Féin who in 1919 formed the First Dáil , effectively declaring Ireland independent , sparking the Irish War of Independence . Britain was to pass the Government of Ireland Act in late 1920 , by which Ireland would have 2 home - ruled states within the British empire . This satisfied Wilson . The provisions of these were inadequate to the supporters of the Irish Republic , however , which claimed full sovereignty . This position was also supported by many Irish Americans . The American Committee for Relief in Ireland was set up in 1920 to assist victims of the Irish War of Independence of 1919 -- 21 . Some Irish - American Senators joined the `` irreconcilables '' who blocked the ratification of the Treaty of Versailles and United States membership in the League of Nations .
