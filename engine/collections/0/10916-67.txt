Task Unit Papa was tasked with the seizure of Paitilla airfield and the destruction of Noriega 's plane there . Several SEALs were concerned about the nature of the mission assigned to them being that airfield seizure was usually the domain of the Army Rangers . Despite these misgivings and a loss of operational surprise , the SEALs of TU Papa proceeded with their mission . Almost immediately upon landing , the 48 SEALs came under withering fire from the PDF stationed at the airfield . Although Noriega 's plane was eventually destroyed , the SEALs suffered four dead and thirteen wounded . Killed were Lt. John Connors , Chief Petty Officer Donald McFaul , Torpedoman 's Mate 2nd Class Issac Rodriguez , and Boatswain 's Mate 1st Class Chris Tilghman .
