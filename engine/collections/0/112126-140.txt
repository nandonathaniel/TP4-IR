The condition of our own ships was such that it was very doubtful what would be their fate . Many a time I would have given the whole group of our capture , to ensure our own ... I can only say that in my life I never saw such efforts as were made to save these ( prize ) ships , and would rather fight another battle than pass through such a week as followed it .
