A report in 2005 by the House of Commons Public Accounts Committee found that the cost of the process of selling the Dome and surrounding land ( which increased to 170 acres from the initial offering of the 48 acres enclosed by the Dome ) and managing the Dome until the deal was closed was £ 28.7 million . £ 33 million were expected to be returned to the taxpayer by 2009 . The value of the 48 acres occupied by the Dome was estimated at £ 48 million , which could have been realised by demolishing the structure , but it was considered preferable to preserve the Dome .
