Jerusalem was an important city of the Byzantine province of Palestina Prima . Just 23 years prior to the Muslim conquest , in 614 , it fell to an invading Sassanid army under Shahrbaraz during the last of the Byzantine - Sassanid Wars . The Persians looted the city , and are said to have massacred its 90,000 Christian inhabitants . As part of the looting , the Church of the Holy Sepulchre was destroyed and the True Cross captured and taken to Ctesiphon as a battle - captured holy relic . The Cross was later returned to Jerusalem by Emperor Heraclius after his final victory against the Persians in 628 . It was believed that the Jews , who were persecuted in their Roman - controlled homeland , had aided the Persians .
