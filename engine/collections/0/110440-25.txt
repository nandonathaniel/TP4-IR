Realising that a treaty in English could not be understood , debated or agreed to by Māori , Hobson instructed missionary Henry Williams and his son Edward Marsh Williams , who was more proficient in Te Reo , the Māori language , to translate the document , and this was done overnight on 4 February . The translation of the Treaty was reviewed by James Busby , and he proposed the substitution of the word whakaminenga for huihuinga , to describe the `` Confederation '' or gathering of the chiefs . This no doubt was a reference to the northern confederation of chiefs with whom Hobson preferred to negotiate , who eventually made up the vast majority of signatories to the Treaty . Hobson believed that elsewhere in the country the Crown could exercise greater freedom over the rights of ' first discoverers ' , which proved unwise as it led to future difficulties with other tribes in the South Island .
