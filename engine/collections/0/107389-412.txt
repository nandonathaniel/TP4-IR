The Confederate government took over the three national mints : the Charlotte Mint in North Carolina , the Dahlonega Mint in Georgia , and the New Orleans Mint in Louisiana . During 1861 , the first two produced small amounts of gold coinage , the latter half dollars . Since the mints used the current dies on hand , these issues remain indistinguishable from those minted by the Union . In New Orleans the Confederacy used its own reverse design to strike four half dollars . US coinage was hoarded and did not have any general circulation . U.S. coinage was admitted as legal tender up to $10 , as were British sovereigns , French Napoleons and Spanish and Mexican doubloons at a fixed rate of exchange . Confederate money was paper and postage stamps .
