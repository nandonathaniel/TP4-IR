Any change to the composition of the Cabinet involving more than one appointment is customarily referred to as a reshuffle ; a routine reshuffle normally occurs every summer . The total number of ministers allowed to be paid as `` Cabinet ministers '' is limited by the Ministerial and Other Salaries Act 1975 , and this has caused successive Prime Ministers problems , and accounts for some of the unusual regular attendees at Cabinet , who are not paid as Cabinet ministers . The number in addition to the Prime Minister is currently 21 ; total cabinet composition fluctuating between 21 and 23 .
