After missing the playoffs in 1970 , Hafey took the Tigers to the finals for the next five years . Basing the team 's strategy around all - out attack had drawbacks . Richmond were dominant in 1972 and were hot favourites in the 1972 VFL Grand Final against Carlton . However , Carlton stunned Richmond in a game of ridiculous high scoring . Even Richmond equalled the then record highest score in a Grand Final of 22.18 ( 150 ) , but Carlton beat it with 28.9 ( 177 ) . Richmond got their revenge in an intensely physical clash in the 1973 VFL Grand Final and went back - to - back in 1974 with a strong win against a resurgent North Melbourne .
