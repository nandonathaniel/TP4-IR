As a parting gift , Lewis gave Fort Clatsop to Coboway , the chief of the Clatsops . Lewis and Clark had no use for the fort , as they were returning east with no plans to revisit the fort in the near future . Because of the heavy rainfall of the region , the original Fort Clatsop had rotted away by the middle of the 19th century .
