At Disneyland , Max , Buff , and Melvin currently reside in The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh , which replaced the Country Bear Playhouse in 2003 ( which had closed two years prior ) . They hang above the entrance to the `` Hunny Heaven '' room , but riders must turn around in order to see them . The set of Max , Buff & Melvin featured there were not the Audio - Animatronic figures found in either of the Playhouse 's two theaters , but rather the static , non-anmatronic ones that were found next door in the Mile Long Bar .
