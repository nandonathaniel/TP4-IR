Big Stink spotted the explosion from a hundred miles away , and flew over to observe . Because of the delays in the mission and the inoperative fuel transfer pump , Bockscar did not have sufficient fuel to reach the emergency landing field at Iwo Jima , so Sweeney and Bock flew to Okinawa . Arriving there , Sweeney circled for 20 minutes trying to contact the control tower for landing clearance , finally concluding that his radio was faulty . Critically low on fuel , Bockscar barely made it to the runway on Okinawa 's Yontan Airfield . With enough fuel for only one landing attempt , Sweeney and Albury brought Bockscar in at 150 miles per hour ( 240 km / h ) instead of the normal 120 miles per hour ( 190 km / h ) , firing distress flares to alert the field of the uncleared landing . The number two engine died from fuel starvation as Bockscar began its final approach . Touching the runway hard , the heavy B - 29 slewed left and towards a row of parked B - 24 bombers before the pilots managed to regain control . The B - 29 's reversible propellers were insufficient to slow the aircraft adequately , and with both pilots standing on the brakes , Bockscar made a swerving 90 - degree turn at the end of the runway to avoid running off the runway . A second engine died from fuel exhaustion by the time the plane came to a stop . The flight engineer later measured fuel in the tanks and concluded that less than five minutes total remained .
