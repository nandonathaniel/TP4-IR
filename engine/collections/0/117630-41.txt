Name Lifetime Description Marcus Licinius Crassus c. 115 BC -- 53 BC Crassus inherited a fortune of 7 million sesterces after the death of his father in 87 BC . After several years of exile , Crassus was able to rebuild his family fortune by seizing the property of executed convicts for himself . Crassus also expanded his wealth by trading in slaves and by purchasing whole neighborhoods of Rome as they burned , for drastically less than market value . Crassus was known in Rome as Dives , meaning `` The Rich '' . It is believed that Crassus expanded his personal fortune to 170 million sesterces , while Pliny the Elder surmised his fortune to be valued even higher , at 200 million sesterces . This would place Crassus 's net worth equal to the total annual budget of the Roman treasury . Crassus has often been listed among the `` wealthiest individuals in history '' , although depending on the estimate of the `` adjusted value '' of a Roman sesterce , his net worth may also be placed in the range of US $200 million to US $20 billion . Augustus Caesar 63 BC -- 19 August 14 AD Listed by Time Magazine with `` $4.6 trillion '' because he `` personally owned all of Egypt '' . Croesus died c. 546 BC The name of Croesus , a historical king of Lydia , was proverbial for wealth already in antiquity ; this is probably due to his being the first ruler to issue true gold coins with a standardised purity for general circulation and not necessarily for his personal wealth .
