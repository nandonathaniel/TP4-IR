A relation that is in first normal form ( 1NF ) must meet additional criteria if it is to qualify for second normal form . Specifically : a relation is in 2NF if it is in 1NF and no non-prime attribute is dependent on any proper subset of any candidate key of the relation . A non-prime attribute of a relation is an attribute that is not a part of any candidate key of the relation .
