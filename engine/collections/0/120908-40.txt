Josh Brolin as Cable : A time - traveling cybernetic soldier , `` in many ways the opposite of Deadpool '' . Director David Leitch called the dynamic between Cable and Deadpool `` sort of classic buddy - cop fare '' , and compared them to the characters portrayed by Nick Nolte and Eddie Murphy , respectively , in 48 Hrs. ( 1982 ) . Leitch added that the character as written in the script was mostly just an `` action character '' , and he relied on Brolin to add nuance to the role and explore the character 's internal pain to avoid it becoming a caricature . Brolin signed a four - film deal to play the character , and described his appearance here as just the introduction for the character , with `` three more movies to reveal more '' .
