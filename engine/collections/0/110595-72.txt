Abundant rice and vegetables are produced from the fertile Sichuan Basin , whereas a wide variety of herbs , mushrooms and other fungi prosper in the highland regions . Pork is overwhelmingly the most common type of meat consumed . Beef is somewhat more common in Sichuan cuisine than it is in other Chinese cuisines , perhaps due to the prevalence of oxen in the region . Sichuan cuisine also uses various bovine and porcine organs as ingredients , such as intestine , arteries , head , tongue , skin and liver , in addition to other commonly used portions of the meat . Rabbit meat is also much more popular in Sichuan than elsewhere in China . It is estimated that the Sichuan Basin and Chongqing area consume about 70 percent of China 's rabbit meat consumption . Yoghurt , which probably spread from India through Tibet in mediaeval times , is consumed among the Han Chinese . This is an unusual custom in other parts of the country . The salt produced from Sichuan salt springs and wells , unlike the sea salt , does not contain iodine , leading to goiter problems before the 20th century .
