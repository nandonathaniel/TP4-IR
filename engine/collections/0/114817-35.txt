The different types of scanning probe microscopes arise from the many different types of interactions that occur when a small probe of some type is scanned over and interacts with a specimen . These interactions or modes can be recorded or mapped as function of location on the surface to form a characterization map . The three most common types of scanning probe microscopes are atomic force microscopes ( AFM ) , near - field scanning optical microscopes ( MSOM or SNOM , scanning near - field optical microscopy ) , and scanning tunneling microscopes ( STM ) . An atomic force microscope has a fine probe , usually of silicon or silicon nitride , attached to a cantilever ; the probe is scanned over the surface of the sample , and the forces that cause an interaction between the probe and the surface of the sample are measured and mapped . A near - field scanning optical microscope is similar to an AFM but its probe consists of a light source in an optical fiber covered with a tip that has usually an aperture for the light to pass through . The microscope can capture either transmitted or reflected light to measure very localized optical properties of the surface , commonly of a biological specimen . Scanning tunneling microscopes have a metal tip with a single apical atom ; the tip is attached to a tube through which a current flows . The tip is scanned over the surface of a conductive sample until a tunneling current flows ; the current is kept constant by computer movement of the tip and an image is formed by the recorded movements of the tip .
