Upon the film 's release , it was noted that the name `` Napoleon Dynamite '' had originally been used by musician Elvis Costello , most visibly on his 1986 album Blood & Chocolate , although he had used the pseudonym on a single B - side as early as 1982 . Filmmaker Jared Hess states that he was not aware of Costello 's use of the name until two days before the end of shooting , when he was informed by a teenage extra . He later said , `` Had I known that name was used by anybody else prior to shooting the whole film , it definitely would have been changed ... I listen to hip - hop , dude . It 's a pretty embarrassing coincidence . '' Hess claims that `` Napoleon Dynamite '' was the name of a man he met around 2000 on the streets of Cicero , Illinois , while doing missionary work for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter - day Saints ( LDS Church ) .
