Stane 's scientists can not duplicate Stark 's miniaturized arc reactor , so Stane ambushes Stark at his home and takes the one from his chest . Stark manages to get to his original reactor to replace it . Potts and several S.H.I.E.L.D. agents attempt to arrest Stane , but he dons his suit and attacks them . Stark fights Stane , but is outmatched without his new reactor to run his suit at full capacity . The fight carries Stark and Stane to the top of the Stark Industries building , and Stark instructs Potts to overload the large arc reactor powering the building . This unleashes a massive electrical surge that causes Stane and his armor to fall into the exploding reactor , killing him . The next day , at a press conference , Stark defies suggestions from S.H.I.E.L.D. and publicly admits to being the superhero the press has dubbed `` Iron Man '' .
