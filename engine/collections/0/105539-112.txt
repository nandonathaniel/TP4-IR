Harley Quinn appears in the DC Universe Online video game , with Arleen Sorkin returning as her voice . Harley appears in the Joker 's Fun house , where she is seen being arrested by Robin if the player uses a villain character , or holding Robin hostage if the character is a hero , in which case the player is required to defeat her . She plays a minor role in T.O. Morrow 's hideout , as she has gone there with the Joker to pursue Morrow . Harley is the basic Legends PVP character granted to Villains without having to spend Marks of Legend . If a player using Harley defeats an enemy player using Joker , the player acquires a feat called Mad Love . To date this was the last time Arleen Sorkin voiced the character .
