The weakened frontiers in Britain and Gaul had dire consequences for the empire . Numerous usurpers rose from Britain , including Marcus ( 406 -- 407 ) , Gratian ( 407 ) , and Constantine III who invaded Gaul in 407 . Britain was effectively abandoned by the empire by 410 due to the crumbling resources and the need to look after more important frontiers . The weakened rhine frontier allowed multiple barbarian tribes , including the Vandals , Alans and Suebi , to cross the river and enter Roman territory in 406 .
