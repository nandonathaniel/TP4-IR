Since at least the emergence of bebop , forms of jazz that are commercially oriented or influenced by popular music have been criticized by purists . According to Bruce Johnson , there has always been a `` tension between jazz as a commercial music and an art form '' . Traditional jazz enthusiasts have dismissed bebop , free jazz , the 1970s jazz fusion era and much else as periods of debasement of the music and betrayals of the tradition . An alternative viewpoint is that jazz is able to absorb and transform influences from diverse musical styles , and that , by avoiding the creation of ' norms ' , other newer , avant - garde forms of jazz will be free to emerge .
