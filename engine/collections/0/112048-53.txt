The winter fur of the European polecat is brownish black or blackish brown , the intensity of which is determined by the colour of the long guard hairs . On the back and flanks , the dark tone is brightened by bright whitish - yellowish , sometimes yellowish - greyish underfur which shows through . The lightly coloured underfur is not equally visible on different parts of the body . On the back and hindquarters , the underfur is almost completely covered by the dark guard hairs . On the flanks , though , the lightening is well defined , and contrasts sharply with the general tone of the back . The throat , lower neck , chest and abdomen are black or blackish brown . The limbs are pure black or black with brown tints , while the tail is black or blackish brown , completely lacking light underfur . The area around and between the eyes is black - brown , with a longitudinal stripe of similar colour along the top of the nose . The ears are dark brown and edged with white . The summer fur is short , sparse and coarse . It is greyer , duller and lacking in the lustre of the winter fur . The underfur is more weakly developed in the summer fur , and has a brownish - grey or rusty - grey colour . The polecat is a good swimmer , but its fur is not as well insulated against cold water as the American mink 's ; while a mink will take 118 minutes to cool in a water temperature of 8 Â° C , the polecat cools down much faster at 26 -- 28 minutes .
