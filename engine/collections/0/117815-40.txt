Though the song had been popular online for years , mainstream success came when it was incorporated into the film Pitch Perfect in 2012 . In the film it is performed by the main character , Beca Mitchell ( Anna Kendrick ) during an audition for a college a cappella group . Unlike the soundtrack version , the single version of the song was re-produced with additional instrumentation ( notably the banjo ) by American Music Award - winning music producer Ali Dee Theodore , Jordan Yaeger and Harvey Mason , Jr ... The single version was extended by an additional minute . Prior to the single 's release , covers of the song as well as tutorials on how to do the song ( using cups ) went viral . Kendrick has stated that she learned the song and its cup percussion from watching and doing it many times on Reddit prior to being cast in Pitch Perfect , and it was therefore written into the film .
