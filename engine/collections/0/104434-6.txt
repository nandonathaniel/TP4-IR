Further evidence against the existence of a short - term memory store comes from experiments involving continual distractor tasks . In 1974 , Robert Bjork and William B. Whitten presented subjects with word pairs to be remembered ; however , before and after each word pair , subjects had to do a simple multiplication task for 12 seconds . After the final word - pair , subjects had to do the multiplication distractor task for 20 seconds . In their results , Bjork and Whitten found that the recency effect ( the increased probability of recall of the last items studied ) and the primacy effect ( the increased probability of recall of the first few items ) still remained . These results would seem inconsistent with the idea of short - term memory as the distractor items would have taken the place of some of the word - pairs in the buffer , thereby weakening the associated strength of the items in long - term memory . Bjork and Whitten hypothesized that these results could be attributed to the memory processes at work for long - term memory retrieval versus short - term memory retrieval .
