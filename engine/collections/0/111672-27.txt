Quartering Act is a name given to a minimum of two Acts of British Parliament in the local governments of the American colonies to provide the British soldiers with any needed accommodations and housing . It also required colonists to provide food for any British soldiers in the area . Each of the Quartering Acts was an amendment to the Mutiny Act and required annual renewal by Parliament . They were originally intended as a response to issues that arose during the French and Indian War and soon became a source of tension between the inhabitants of the Thirteen Colonies and the government in London , England . These tensions would later fuel the fire that led to the American Revolution .
