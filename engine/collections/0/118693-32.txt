Ultimately , the photographic process came about from a series of refinements and improvements in the first 20 years . In 1884 George Eastman , of Rochester , New York , developed dry gel on paper , or film , to replace the photographic plate so that a photographer no longer needed to carry boxes of plates and toxic chemicals around . In July 1888 Eastman 's Kodak camera went on the market with the slogan `` You press the button , we do the rest '' . Now anyone could take a photograph and leave the complex parts of the process to others , and photography became available for the mass - market in 1901 with the introduction of the Kodak Brownie .
