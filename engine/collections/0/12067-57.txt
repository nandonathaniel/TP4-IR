Just as the Riddler finishes his question , Dick shows up and knocks Conundrum out . Riddler then admits that he is completely baffled that Batman is indeed there , since he was only stalling for time until he thought of something , leading him to wonder if there truly is a Batsignal in his cane ( a panel during Riddler 's `` bluff '' shows that there is indeed a Batsignal in his cane , as a green question mark alongside a map shows up inside the Batmobile 's window ) .
