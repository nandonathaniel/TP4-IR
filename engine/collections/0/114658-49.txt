Another Arabic word sometimes used for Christians , particularly in a political context , is Ṣalībī ( صليبي `` Crusader '' ) from ṣalīb ( صليب `` cross '' ) which refers to Crusaders and has negative connotations . However , Ṣalībī is a modern term ; historically , Muslim writers described European Christian Crusaders as al - Faranj or Alfranj ( الفرنج ) and Firinjīyah ( الفرنجيّة ) in Arabic . This word comes from the name of the Franks and can be seen in the Arab history text Al - Kamil fi al - Tarikh by Ali ibn al - Athir .
