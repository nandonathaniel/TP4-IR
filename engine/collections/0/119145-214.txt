Roman Britannia was contemporaneously under constant threat during the 3rd and 4th centuries CE by northern Picts as well as the Germanic Saxons who sailed from north of Gaul to the eastern coast of the British Isles . Late in CE 367 , the Roman garrisons in Britannia collapsed as the Germanic barbarians poured into the region from all directions . Attempting to permanently reestablish control on Britannia , the emperor Valentinian sent an experienced Roman commander who was able to beat the invaders back after a year - long war and gain control of Londonium , but it was a Pyrrhic victory , for the Germanic invaders had burned down standing settlements , ravaged cities on the isles , interrupted trade and annihilated entire Roman garrisons . By the middle of the 5th century , the Picts , Scots and Anglo - Saxons began to dominate the once Roman Britannia .
