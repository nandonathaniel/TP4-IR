After many years of growth and gradual change , there was one seismic event which changed British society dramatically . The Black Death in the middle of the 14th century almost halved the population . Whole villages were wiped out by the plague , but rather than destroying society it managed to reinvigorate it . Before the plague there was a large , probably excessive , workforce with not enough productive work available . Overpopulation meant that before the Black Death too many people were competing for scarce resources . Afterwards , the drop in population meant that labourers were in short supply and were paid better . Peasants who had once been confined to a landowner 's estate now had an incentive to travel to areas without workers . This social mobility was combined with the fact that peasants could charge much more for their services , and this began a switch from indentured labourer to wage earner which signalled the decline of the feudal system .
