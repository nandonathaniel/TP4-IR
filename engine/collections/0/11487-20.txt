Chloroplasts develop from proplastids when seedlings emerge from the ground . Thylakoid formation requires light . In the plant embryo and in the absence of light , proplastids develop into etioplasts that contain semicrystalline membrane structures called prolamellar bodies . When exposed to light , these prolamellar bodies develop into thylakoids . This does not happen in seedlings grown in the dark , which undergo etiolation . An underexposure to light can cause the thylakoids to fail . This causes the chloroplasts to fail resulting in the death of the plant .
