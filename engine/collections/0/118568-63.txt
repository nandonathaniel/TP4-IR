Initially an interconnected fluid system was planned , similar to the one that Alec Issigonis and Alex Moulton were working on in the mid-1950s at Alvis . They had assessed the mechanically interconnected CitroÃ«n 2CV suspension at that time ( according to an interview by Moulton with Car Magazine in the late 1990s ) , which inspired the design of the Hydrolastic suspension system for the Mini and Morris / Austin 1100 , to try to keep the benefits of the 2CV system ( ride comfort , body levelling , keeping the roadwheel under good control and the tyres in contact with the road ) , but with added roll stiffness that the 2CV lacked . The short development time of the car meant this was not ready in time for the Mini 's launch . The system intended for the Mini was further developed and the hydrolastic system was first used on the Morris 1100 , launched in 1962 ; the Mini gained the system later in 1964 . As launched the Mini had simpler suspension made from conical springs of solid rubber . These were compact , saving on intrusion into the cabin space , and required no maintenance . The fully independent suspension the rubber cones provided was almost unheard of in low - cost cars of the time . The conical shape gave the springs a progressive action , becoming stiffer at greater degrees of compression . This gave the ADO15 a smooth ride over small bumps but minimised roll and pitch on more uneven surfaces . It also allowed the springs to cope with the huge variance in load between an unladen car ( approx. 600 kg or 1300 lbs ) and a fully laden one ( just over 1000 kg or 2240 lbs , or a 70 per cent increase ) .
