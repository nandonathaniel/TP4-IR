Public library advocacy is support given to a public library for its financial and philosophical goals or needs . Most often this takes the form of monetary or material donations or campaigning to the institutions which oversee the library , sometimes by advocacy groups such as Friends of Libraries and community members . Originally , library advocacy was centered on the library itself , but current trends show libraries positioning themselves to demonstrate they provide `` economic value to the community '' in means that are not directly related to the checking out of books and other media .
