In August 2013 the LHCb team revealed an anomaly in the angular distribution of B meson decay products which could not be predicted by the Standard Model ; this anomaly had a statistical certainty of 4.5 sigma , just short of the 5 sigma needed to be officially recognized as a discovery . It is unknown what the cause of this anomaly would be , although the Z ' boson has been suggested as a possible candidate .
