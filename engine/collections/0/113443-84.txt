Both governments have long viewed their bilateral trade well below its optimal potential , with the only long term way of rectifying this through having a Free trade agreement ( FTA ) . Both governments have set up a joint study group ( JSG ) to negotiate the specifications of an agreement , a final agreement would be signed between India and Eurasian Economic Union of which Russia is a part of ( also including Kazakhstan , Armenia , Kyrgyzstan & Belarus ) . Thereby , the Indo - Russian FTA would result in a much bigger free trade agreement including India , Russia , Kazakhstan , Armenia , Kyrgyzstan & Belarus . It is predicted once an FTA is in place bilateral trade will increase manifold , thereby significantly increasing the importance of economics in bilateral ties .
