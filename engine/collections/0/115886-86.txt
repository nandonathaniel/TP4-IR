Film noir is often associated with an urban setting , and a few cities -- Los Angeles , San Francisco , New York , and Chicago , in particular -- are the location of many of the classic films . In the eyes of many critics , the city is presented in noir as a `` labyrinth '' or `` maze '' . Bars , lounges , nightclubs , and gambling dens are frequently the scene of action . The climaxes of a substantial number of films noir take place in visually complex , often industrial settings , such as refineries , factories , trainyards , power plants -- most famously the explosive conclusion of White Heat , set at a chemical plant . In the popular ( and , frequently enough , critical ) imagination , in noir it is always night and it always rains .
