Historically , the rank was first introduced in Poland in the 17th century , together with mercenary troops of Italian origin . In foreign troops on the royal payroll , a kapral commanded four ranks of musketeers or part of a company of pikemen . In the 20th century , between the world wars , the rank of corporal was held by both conscripted NCOs and professional soldiers alike . This was changed after World War II , when the Polish Army was under Soviet command and the rank of kapral was modified to resemble that of Soviet junior sergeant , reserved for conscripted NCOs . In the modern Polish Army , the rank is exclusively reserved for professional soldiers .
