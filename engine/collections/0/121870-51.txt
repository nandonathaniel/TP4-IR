From their bases in the Great Lakes area , the French steadily pushed their way down the Mississippi river valley to the Gulf of Mexico from 1682 onward . Initially , French relations with the Natchez Indians were friendly and in 1716 the French were allowed to establish Fort Rosalie ( modern Natchez , Mississippi ) on the Natchez territory . In 1729 , following several cases of French land fraud , the Natchez burned down Fort Rosalie and killed about 200 French settlers . In response , the French together with their allies , the Choctaw , waged a near - genocidal campaign against the Natchez as French and Choctaw set out to eliminate the Natchez as a people with the French often burning alive all of the Natchez they captured . Following the French victory over the Natchez in 1731 which resulted in the destruction of the Natchez people , the French were able to begin fur trading down the Arkansas river and greatly expanded the Arkansas Post to take advantage of the fur trade .
