As the song spread , it was adapted , modified , and rewritten to the point that dozens of versions existed by the end of the 18th century , although only a few are typically sung nowadays . The references to the traditional English fair , `` Scarborough Fair '' and the refrain `` parsley , sage , rosemary , and thyme '' date to 19th century versions , and the refrain may have been borrowed from the ballad Riddles Wisely Expounded , ( Child Ballad # 1 ) , which has a similar plot . A number of older versions refer to locations other than Scarborough Fair , including Wittingham Fair , Cape Ann , `` twixt Berwik and Lyne '' , etc . Many versions do not mention a place - name , and are often generically titled ( `` The Lovers ' Tasks '' , `` My Father Gave Me an Acre of Land '' , etc . ) .
