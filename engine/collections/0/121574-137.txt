Although strongly opposed by both the business community and the Conservative Party when introduced in the UK in 1999 , the Conservatives reversed their opposition in 2000 . Accounts differ as to the effects of the minimum wage . The Centre for Economic Performance found no discernible impact on employment levels from the wage increases , while the Low Pay Commission found that employers had reduced their rate of hiring and employee hours employed , and found ways to cause current workers to be more productive ( especially service companies ) . The Institute for the Study of Labor found prices in the minimum wage sector rose significantly faster than prices in non-minimum wage sectors , in the four years following the implementation of the minimum wage . Neither trade unions nor employer organizations contest the minimum wage , although the latter had especially done so heavily until 1999 .
