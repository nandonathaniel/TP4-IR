During the 1973 oil embargo by the Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries ( OAPEC ) , in an effort to conserve fuel , Congress enacted a trial period of year - round DST ( P.L. 93 - 182 ) , beginning January 6 , 1974 , and ending April 27 , 1975 . The trial was hotly debated . Those in favor pointed to increased daylight hours in the winter evening : more time for recreation , reduced lighting and heating demands , reduced crime , and reduced automobile accidents . The opposition was concerned about children leaving for school in the dark . The act was amended in October 1974 ( P.L. 93 - 434 ) to return to standard time for the period beginning October 27 , 1974 , and ending February 23 , 1975 , when DST resumed . When the trial ended in 1975 , the country returned to observing summer DST ( with the aforementioned exceptions ) .
