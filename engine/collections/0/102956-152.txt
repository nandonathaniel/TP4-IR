To deal with the problem of `` shortage of labour '' , Trinidad and Tobago planters compensated for the loss of their slaves by importing workers from the 1830s until 1917 . Initially , Chinese , free West Africans , and Portuguese from the island of Madeira were imported . They were replaced by indentured servants from India who arrived on 30 May 1845 . In addition , large numbers of ex-slaves migrated from the Lesser Antilles to Trinidad and Tobago .
