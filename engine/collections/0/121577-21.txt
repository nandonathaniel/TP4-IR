At the time of European colonization of the Americas , the historic Iroquoian - speaking Cherokee and Muskogean - speaking Yamasee & Hitchiti peoples . Closer to the Coastal regions were groups of small , Muskogean tribal groups with a loosely shared heritage that were divided mostly between the Guale associated groups to the east & the Timucua group to the south , a group of 35 tribes whose lands went all the way into central Florida & were backed up to the Hitchiti to the west . They were related to the three large Muskogean nations between the Mississippi River & the Cherokee -- the Choctaw , Chickasaw & Coushatta -- as well as a few other small tribes along the Florida - Alabama Gulf Coast region . Archaeology shows that they were in this region , at the very least , from the 12th century to colonial times . The name for Appalachia came from their languages & , in particular , from a specific Timucuan group from northern Florida called the Apalachee .
