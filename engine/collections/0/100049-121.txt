The external level defines how each group of end - users sees the organization of data in the database . A single database can have any number of views at the external level . The conceptual level unifies the various external views into a compatible global view . It provides the synthesis of all the external views . It is out of the scope of the various database end - users , and is rather of interest to database application developers and database administrators . The internal level ( or physical level ) is the internal organization of data inside a DBMS . It is concerned with cost , performance , scalability and other operational matters . It deals with storage layout of the data , using storage structures such as indexes to enhance performance . Occasionally it stores data of individual views ( materialized views ) , computed from generic data , if performance justification exists for such redundancy . It balances all the external views ' performance requirements , possibly conflicting , in an attempt to optimize overall performance across all activities .
