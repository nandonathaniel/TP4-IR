The muscles of the thigh can be classified into three groups according to their location : anterior and posterior muscles and the adductors ( on the medial side ) . All the adductors except gracilis insert on the femur and act on the hip joint , and so functionally qualify as hip muscles . The majority of the thigh muscles , the `` true '' thigh muscles , insert on the leg ( either the tibia or the fibula ) and act primarily on the knee joint . Generally , the extensors lie on anterior of the thigh and flexors lie on the posterior . Even though the sartorius flexes the knee , it is ontogenetically considered an extensor since its displacement is secondary .
