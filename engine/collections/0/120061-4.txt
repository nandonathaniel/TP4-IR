As of 2014 , it was often reported in popular media and in the scientific literature that there are about 10 times as many microbial cells in the human body as there are human cells ; this figure was based on estimates that the human microbiome includes around 100 trillion bacterial cells and that an adult human typically has around 10 trillion human cells . In 2014 , the American Academy of Microbiology published a FAQ that emphasized that the number of microbial cells and the number of human cells are both estimates , and noted that recent research had arrived at a new estimate of the number of human cells -- approximately 37.2 trillion , meaning that the ratio of microbial - to - human cells , if the original estimate of 100 trillion bacterial cells is correct , is closer to 3 : 1 . In 2016 , another group published a new estimate of the ratio being roughly 1 : 1 ( 1.3 : 1 , with `` an uncertainty of 25 % and a variation of 53 % over the population of standard 70 - kg males '' ) .
