The production crew returned to Kaua ʻi to film aerial shots for Isla Nublar , and also shot smaller sequences at the Honolulu Zoo , the Hawaii Convention Center , and the Kualoa Ranch on Oʻahu for the Gallimimus valley scenes . However , the bulk of the movie was filmed in New Orleans , Louisiana , where the Main Street of the Visitors Complex was constructed at the abandoned Six Flags New Orleans theme park .
