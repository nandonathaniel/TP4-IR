Companies and other taxable non-humans are issued an eight - digit `` CVR '' number which is a mostly sequential number , there is no defined rule preventing the issuance of a CVR number with the same digits as a CPR number of an unrelated person , so the type of number must always be indicated , but CPR are always 10 - digit and CVR 8 - digit . VAT registration numbers for Danish companies are simply `` DK '' followed by the CVR number , but far from all CVR numbered entities are VAT registered ( companies with no need for a VAT number , such as holding companies , typically do not request a VAT registration for their CVR ) .
