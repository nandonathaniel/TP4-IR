The series ' protagonist is Korra , a 17 - year - old girl from the Southern Water Tribe and the incarnation of the Avatar after Aang 's death . The character was partly inspired by Avatar Kyoshi of the original series , whom the creators say was popular among fans . To avoid repetition of Aang 's adventures during the original series , the creators wanted to root the show in one place : Republic City . A concept drawing of the city , released with the announcement of the series , shows the city 's design as inspired by Shanghai , Hong Kong , Manhattan , and Vancouver with a steampunk vibe . In the show 's first season , Korra has to learn airbending from Tenzin , the youngest son of Aang and Katara , and contend with Amon 's anti-bender revolution taking place in the city . The show 's second season also provides the origins of the Avatar Cycle .
