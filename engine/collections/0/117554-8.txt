Another factor was that the WAAC uniform was widely copied . Women factory workers often wore military - looking utilitarian beige , khaki , olive drab , or pearl - gray slacks or skirts with matching jackets and white , beige , khaki , or olive drab blouses that looked like a uniform . Similar uniforms were worn by female civilian workers and members of civilian women 's volunteer and auxiliary organizations . Department stores sold exact copies of the uniform to patriotic young girls ( `` Junior WAACs '' ) and women who were working for women 's volunteer and auxiliary organizations like Military Canteens , Civil Defense , the American Red Cross , and the USO . The dressmaking firms who manufactured them ironically got priority over the WAACs for allotments of Olive Drab and Khaki cloth because they also made men 's uniforms for the military . If women wearing these faux uniforms got in fights or brawls , were publicly intoxicated , or were caught `` behaving inappropriately '' ( everything from walking after dark with a man to having sex with him ) while in uniform , they were initially assumed to be WAACs . Add to them the number of `` Victory Girls '' ( thrill - seeking local teen girls who slept with servicemen ) , local `` townie '' women , and prostitutes - they often dressed in uniform as either a kink , a means to commit fraud by pretending to be servicewomen , or get access to military installations to meet servicemen . Legitimate WACs who had duties off base often had to wear a `` field sign '' ( an expedient symbol to tell friend from foe ) to distinguish them from the throngs of imitators trying to sneak on base .
