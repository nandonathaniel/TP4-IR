The Advanced Access Content System ( AACS ) is a standard for content distribution and digital rights management . It was developed by AS Licensing Administrator , LLC ( AACS LA ) , a consortium that includes Disney , Intel , Microsoft , Panasonic , Warner Bros. , IBM , Toshiba , and Sony . Since the appearance of the format on devices in 2006 , several successful attacks have been made on it . The first known attack relied on the trusted client problem . In addition , decryption keys have been extracted from a weakly protected player ( WinDVD ) . Since keys can be revoked in newer releases , this is only a temporary attack , and new keys must continually be discovered in order to decrypt the latest discs .
