After hearing Quagmire brag about his sexual exploits , Peter feels that he has missed out on enjoying the single lifestyle . Death is summoned to The Drunken Clam on a false alarm ( thinking that Horace had died ) , and decides to grant Peter 's wish by sending him , along with Brian , back to 1984 for one night . He notices his friend Cleveland , in his ' 80s look , who high - fives him around the pool . He then sees 18 - year - old Lois Pewterschmidt walking around the country club pool , taking her high - heeled shoes off and jumping off the diving board into the pool with `` Mr. Night '' playing in the background , a reference to Caddyshack . Appearing to others as his 18 - year - old self , Peter cancels his scheduled movie date to see Zapped ! with Lois , instead accepting an invitation from Cleveland to go and party at a bar . Peter enjoys the evening , and ends up making out with actress Molly Ringwald before Death appears to return him to the present .
