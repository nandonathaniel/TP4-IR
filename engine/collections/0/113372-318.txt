All of the 1994 Trans Am GT options became standard in 1995 - 2002 as part of the Trans Am package , and the GT name / package was dropped for 1995 . Some of the early fourth - generation Trans Am and Formula Firebirds list `` GT '' on the vehicle 's title or registration . The reason behind this is because the VIN does not specify a `` package '' ( Formula , Trans Am , Trans Am GT , Firehawk , etc . ) ; it only specifies the engine ( 5.7 L V8 LT1 ) . Because the title is based on the VIN alone , titles and registrations often list all of the packages , but it does not mean the car is equipped with any certain package .
