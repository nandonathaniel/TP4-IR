Two websites -- thescienceofdeduction.co.uk and johnwatsonblog.co.uk -- feature the events from the show in the form of puzzles and case - summaries , often with comments ( for example , by John Watson 's sister , `` Harry '' ) . There are also several blogs about `` unseen '' cases that do not feature on television . Similar to the broadcast cases , these retain familiar elements from classic Arthur Conan Doyle stories : `` The Geek Interpreter '' instead of `` The Greek Interpreter '' , and `` The Six Thatchers '' instead of `` The Six Napoleons '' . On the websites , links can be found to Molly Hooper 's diary and the official website of Connie Prince .
