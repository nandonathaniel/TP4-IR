The pro-independence organisation National Collective was identified by the Independent newspaper as the initiators of an online hashtag campaign that began in mid-August 2014 . Writing for the Independent , Antonia Molloy said that the previous `` # IndyReasons '' hashtag campaign served as the inspiration for the `` # YesBecause '' campaign that was observed on the Twitter , Facebook and Vine social media platforms . From 21 August , users were invited to explain their reasons for voting `` Yes '' and # YesBecause was trending on Twitter after an hour from the launch . The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation ( CBC ) reported on 22 August that a `` # NoBecause '' campaign emerged in opposition to the Collective .
