There are several non-contact variants of American football , such as flag football . In flag football the ballcarrier is not tackled ; instead , defenders aim to pull a flag tied around his waist . Another variant , touch football , simply requires the ballcarrier to be touched to be considered downed . A game of touch football may require that the player be touched with either one or two hands to be considered down , depending on the rules used .
