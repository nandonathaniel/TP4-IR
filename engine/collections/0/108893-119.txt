The final air attack mission ( code - named Mad Dog Flight ) comprised five B - 26s , four of which were manned by American CIA contract air crews and pilots from the Alabama Air Guard . One FAR Sea Fury ( piloted by Douglas Rudd ) and two FAR T - 33s ( piloted by Rafael del Pino and Alvaro Prendes ) shot down two of these B - 26s , killing four American airmen . Combat air patrols were flown by Douglas A4D - 2N Skyhawk jets of VA - 34 squadron operating from USS Essex , with nationality and other markings removed . Sorties were flown to reassure Brigade soldiers and pilots , and to intimidate Cuban government forces without directly engaging in acts of war . At 10 am , a tank battle had broken out , with the brigadista holding their line until about 2 : 00 pm , which led Olvia to order a retreat into Gir칩n . Following the last air attacks , San Rom치n ordered his paratroopers and the men of the 3rd Battalion to launch a surprise attack , which was initially successful , but soon failed . With the brigadistas in disorganized retreat , the Cuban Army and militiamen started to advance rapidly , taking San Blas and only being stopped outside of Gir칩n at about 11 am . Later that afternoon , San Rom치n heard the rumbling of the advancing T - 34s and reported with no more mortar rounds and bazooka rounds , he could not stop the tanks and ordered his men to fall back to the beach . Oliva arrived afterwards to find that the brigadistas were all heading out to the beach or retreating into the jungle or swamps . Without direct air support , and short of ammunition , Brigade 2506 ground forces retreated to the beaches in the face of considerable onslaught from Cuban government artillery , tanks and infantry .
