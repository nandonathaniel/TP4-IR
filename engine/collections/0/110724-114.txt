Legislative restrictions on Canadian immigration that had favoured British and other European immigrants were amended in the 1960s , opening the doors to immigrants from all parts of the world . While the 1950s had seen high levels of immigration from Britain , Ireland , Italy , and northern continental Europe , by the 1970s immigrants increasingly came from India , China , Vietnam , Jamaica and Haiti . Immigrants of all backgrounds tended to settle in the major urban centres , particularly Toronto , Montreal and Vancouver .
