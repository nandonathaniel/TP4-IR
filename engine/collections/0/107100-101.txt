The period between the two World Wars saw London 's geographical extent growing more quickly than ever before or since . A preference for lower density suburban housing , typically semi-detached , by Londoners seeking a more `` rural '' lifestyle , superseded Londoners ' old predilection for terraced houses . This was facilitated not only by a continuing expansion of the rail network , including trams and the Underground , but also by slowly widening car ownership . London 's suburbs expanded outside the boundaries of the County of London , into the neighbouring counties of Essex , Hertfordshire , Kent , Middlesex and Surrey .
