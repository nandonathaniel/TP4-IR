The ancient Aitareya Upanishad equates Indra , along with other deities , with Atman ( soul , self ) in the Vedanta 's spirit of internalization of rituals and gods . It begins with its cosmological theory in verse 1.1. 1 by stating that , `` in the beginning , Atman , verily one only , was here - no other blinking thing whatever ; he bethought himself : let me now create worlds '' . This soul , which the text refers to as Brahman as well , then proceeds to create the worlds and beings in those worlds wherein all Vedic gods and goddesses such as sun - god , moon - god , Agni and other divinities become active cooperative organs of the body . The Atman thereafter creates food , and thus emerges a sustainable non-sentient universe , according to the Upanishad . The eternal Atman then enters each living being making the universe full of sentient beings , but these living beings fail to perceive their Atman . The first one to see the Atman as Brahman , asserts the Upanishad , said , `` idam adarsha or `` I have seen It '' . Others then called this first seer as Idam - dra or `` It - seeing '' , which over time came to be cryptically known as `` Indra '' , because , claims Aitareya Upanishad , everyone including the gods like short nicknames . The passing mention of Indra in this Upanishad , states Alain Dani√©lou , is a symbolic folk etymology .
