Kanishka 's copper coinage which came into the scene during 100 - 200 CE was of two types : one had the usual `` standing king '' obverse , and on the rarer second type the king is sitting on a throne . At about the same time there was Huvishka 's copper coinage which was more varied ; on the reverse , as on Kanishka 's copper , there was always one of the numerous deities ; on the obverse the king was portrayed ( 1 ) riding on an elephant , or ( 2 ) reclining on a couch , or ( 3 ) seated cross-legged , or ( 4 ) seated with arms raised .
