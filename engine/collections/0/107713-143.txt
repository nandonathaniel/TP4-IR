In October 1999 the Isle of Man Post Office unveiled a set of 6 stamps honouring their native sons ' music . The official launch took place at the London Palladium where the stage show of Saturday Night Fever was playing . A similar launch was held in New York shortly after to coincide with the show opening across the Atlantic . The songs depicted on the stamps are `` Massachusetts '' , `` Words '' , `` I 've Gotta Get A Message To You '' , `` Night Fever '' , `` Stayin ' Alive '' and `` Immortality '' .
