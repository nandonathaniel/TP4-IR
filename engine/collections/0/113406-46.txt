IEEE 802.11 e is an approved amendment to the IEEE 802.11 standard that defines a set of quality - of - service enhancements for wireless LAN applications through modifications to the Media Access Control ( MAC ) layer . The standard is considered of critical importance for delay - sensitive applications , such as voice over wireless IP . IEEE 802.1 p defines 8 different classes of service ( including one dedicated to voice ) for traffic on layer - 2 wired Ethernet . The ITU - T G.hn standard , which provides a way to create a high - speed ( up to 1 gigabit per second ) Local area network ( LAN ) using existing home wiring ( power lines , phone lines and coaxial cables ) . G.hn provides QoS by means of `` Contention - Free Transmission Opportunities '' ( CFTXOPs ) which are allocated to flows ( such as a VoIP call ) which require QoS and which have negotiated a `` contract '' with the network controllers .
