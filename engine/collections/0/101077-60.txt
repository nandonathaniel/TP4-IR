In Victoria on 21 December 2011 , legislation was passed allowing new trials where there is `` fresh and compelling DNA evidence , where the person acquitted subsequently admits to the crime , or where it becomes clear that key witnesses have given false evidence '' . Retrial applications however could only be made for serious offences such as murder , manslaughter , arson causing death , serious drug offences and aggravated forms of rape and armed robbery .
