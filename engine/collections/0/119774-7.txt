Also called the `` 40 - man roster '' , the expanded roster is composed of all the players in a Major League club 's organization who are signed to a major - league contract . The 40 - man roster limit has been in effect since 1921 , except for 1945 and 1946 when it was raised to 48 to accommodate veterans returning from military service in World War II , and from 1962 to 1965 when it was raised to 41 to add a reserve spot for first - year players acquired before implementation of a player draft was approved prior to the 1965 season .
