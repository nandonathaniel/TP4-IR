The legislation is interpreted in different ways by different police authorities . For example , some authorities allow clubs to possess long - barrelled pistols for members to use , and allow members who own them to allow other members to use them . Other authorities place the condition that only the owner may fire them ; it is considered an offence for anyone else to even touch the firearm . This effectively requires members each to own their own pistol . In 2002 the Home Office issued firearms law guidance to the police , a 212 - page long document . A revised version was published in October 2013 . In 2012 the British Shooting Sports Council believed that the law needed to be consolidated , but did not call for a review .
