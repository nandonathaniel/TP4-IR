There was a boom in skyscraper construction in Chicago from 1888 onwards . By 1893 , Chicago had built 12 skyscrapers between 16 and 20 stories tall , tightly clustered in the center of the financial district . Chicago 's skyscrapers , however , were constrained by the contemporary limits of steel - frame design and the muddy sub-soil in the city , which together limited most of their skyscrapers to around 16 or 17 stories . Chicago 's skyscrapers rapidly became tourist destinations for the views of the wider city they provided from their upper floors and as attractive sites in their own right . Tourists were advised to hire cabs for street tours of the skyscrapers -- by lying back in the cab , they would be able to safely take in the tops of the tall buildings .
