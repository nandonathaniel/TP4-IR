Taxpayers have attempted to argue that the Cordner Doctrine ( see above ) should not apply where the coins remain in circulation , as the coins in the Cordner case ( gold coins ) had been withdrawn from circulation . This argument has been rejected . In the Stoecklin case , the court ruled that the taxpayer who receives coins ( in this case , silver dollar coins ) as compensation for services is taxed at the fair market value of the coins , not the lower face value , regardless of whether or not the coins have been withdrawn from circulation . Similarly , in the case of United States v. Kahre , the criminal defendants ' arguments -- that where gold or silver coins are currently circulating , the taxpayer may report the coins as income at their face value and not at the higher fair market value -- were rejected . The Kahre case also made news because although the defendants lost their argument that the receipt of circulating coins could be taxed at the lower face value , the defendants were not convicted of the criminal charges against them , with the main defendant drawing a hung jury . Kahre was later convicted and is currently serving a 15 - year sentence in a federal penitentiary .
