During the Second World War , during Operation Fish , Britain 's gold reserves and negotiable foreign securities were secretly packed in crates labelled ' Fish ' and shipped across the Atlantic Ocean to Canada . The securities , arriving at Halifax on July 1 , 1940 , were locked in an underground vault three stories beneath the Sun Life Building , guarded around the clock by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police . The gold was shipped on to Ottawa . The extremely secretive United Kingdom Security Deposit , operating in the vault , arranged for the sale of Britain 's negotiable securities on the New York Stock Exchange over the next few years to pay for Britain 's war expenses . The 5,000 Sun Life employees never knew what was stored away beneath them and not a single piece of the cargo went missing nor was any information about the operation ever leaked .
