On 11 January 2011 , it was confirmed that Christopher Lee would reprise his role as Saruman the White . Lee had originally said he would have liked to have shown how Saruman is first corrupted by Sauron , but would not be comfortable flying to New Zealand at his age . Lee went on to say that if a film were made , he would love to voice Smaug , as it would mean he could record his part in England and not have to travel . On 10 January 2011 , it was reported that Lee had entered into negotiations to reprise the role of Saruman .
