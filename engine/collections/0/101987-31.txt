World records for marathon running have been set four times . Khalid Khannouchi , representing the United States , set the men 's world record in 2 : 05 : 38 in 2002 . The following year , British runner Paula Radcliffe set the women 's world record in 2 : 15 : 25 ( later briefly downgraded to `` world best '' by the IAAF as it was achieved in a mixed race , but restored to the title of `` world Record '' shortly thereafter ) . Radcliffe 's time also stands as the current course record in the Women 's Elite Race : this followed women 's records set in 1983 and 1985 by Grete Waitz and Ingrid Kristiansen respectively , both of Norway . The current men 's course record , and the 2nd fastest marathon time in history , is 2 : 03 : 05 set by Kenyan Eliud Kipchoge in 2016 . Kurt Fearnley of Australia set the Men 's Wheelchair Race course record at 1 : 28 : 57 in 2009 , and the Women 's equivalent was set by American athlete Tatyana McFadden in 2013 , with 1 : 46 : 02 .
