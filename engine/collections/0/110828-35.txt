The seven reach Mount Aris to find the kingdom deserted . Following a singing voice to a fountain , they are pulled down a whirlpool where the singer , the seapony Princess Skystar , gives them air bubble helmets and takes them to her underwater home of Seaquestria . Skystar identifies her kind as the hippogriffs , transformed by a magic pearl used by her mother , Queen Novo , to hide from the Storm King 's assault ; Novo demonstrates by turning the ponies into seaponies and Spike into a pufferfish . When Novo denies them the pearl to use against the Storm King , Twilight desperately attempts to steal the pearl while letting her oblivious friends socialize with the seaponies as a distraction . Pinkie Pie nearly changes Novo 's mind until Twilight triggers an alarm and is caught by the outraged queen , who banishes the entire group to the surface .
