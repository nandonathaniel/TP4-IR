On 16 December 2007 , New Line and MGM announced that Jackson would be executive producer of The Hobbit and its sequel . The two studios would co-finance the film and the latter studio ( via 20th Century Fox ) would distribute the film outside North America -- New Line 's first ever such deal with another major studio . Each film 's budget was estimated at US $150 million , which compares to the US $94 million budget for each of the films in Jackson 's Lord of the Rings trilogy . After completion of the merger of New Line Cinema with Warner Bros. in February 2008 , the two parts were announced as scheduled for release in December 2011 and 2012 . Producer Mark Ordesky , the executive producer of The Lord of the Rings , planned to return to supervise the prequels. Jackson explained he chose not to direct because it would have been unsatisfying to compete with his previous films .
