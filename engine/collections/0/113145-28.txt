On 21 August 1911 , the painting was stolen from the Louvre . The theft was not discovered until the next day , when painter Louis Béroud walked into the museum and went to the Salon Carré where the Mona Lisa had been on display for five years , only to find four iron pegs on the wall . Béroud contacted the head of the guards , who thought the painting was being photographed for promotional purposes . A few hours later , Béroud checked back with the Section Chief of the Louvre who confirmed that the Mona Lisa was not with the photographers . The Louvre was closed for an entire week during the investigation .
