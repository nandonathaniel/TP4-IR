In the finale , the final two chefs are each given the opportunity to develop their own menus and lead a brigade of former competitors through a full dinner service on their own . In the first five seasons , this included the opportunity to decorate half of the Hell 's Kitchen restaurant to their liking . Prior to the dinner service , the two chefs compete in a tasting contest , and the winner will earn the advantage of picking their brigade of chefs first . Ramsay will ensure that all menu items meet his standards for high cuisine prior to service , and he and his sous chefs will oversee the service to make sure that his high quality standards are retained , but does not otherwise get involved , allowing the two remaining chefs to demonstrate their ability to run the line .
