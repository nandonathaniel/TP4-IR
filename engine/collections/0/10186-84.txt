Beach towns , such as Tortuguero , Costa Rica , have transitioned from a tourism industry that made profits from selling sea turtle meat and shells to an ecotourism - based economy . Tortuguero is considered to be the founding location of sea turtle conservation . In the 1960s the cultural demand for sea turtle meat , shells , and eggs was quickly killing the once abundant sea turtle populations that nested on the beach . The Caribbean Conservation Corporation began working with villagers to promote ecotourism as a permanent substitute to sea turtle hunting . Sea turtle nesting grounds became sustainable . Tourists love to come and visit the nesting grounds , although it causes a lot of stress to the turtles because all of the eggs can get damaged or harmed . Since the creation of a sea turtle , ecotourism - based economy , Tortugero annually houses thousands of tourists who visit the protected 22 - mile ( 35 km ) beach that hosts sea turtle walks and nesting grounds .
