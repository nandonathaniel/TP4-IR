In his homily , he stressed that `` if we do not profess Jesus Christ , things go wrong . We may become a charitable NGO , but not the Church , the Bride of the Lord . '' He went on to teach that `` When we do not profess Jesus Christ , we profess the worldliness of the devil ... when we profess Christ without the Cross , we are not disciples of the Lord , we are worldly '' . The theme of rejecting `` spiritual worldliness '' , described as a leitmotif of his teachings even before he became pope , was emphasized in his first apostolic exhortation . Understanding this worldliness as `` putting oneself at the center '' , he said that it is the `` greatest danger for the Church , for us , who are in the Church '' .
