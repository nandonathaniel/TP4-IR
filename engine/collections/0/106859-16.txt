The Upper Peninsula contains 29 % of the land area of Michigan but just 3 % of its total population . Residents are frequently called Yoopers ( derived from `` U.P. - ers '' ) and have a strong regional identity . Large numbers of French Canadian , Finnish , Swedish , Cornish , and Italian immigrants came to the Upper Peninsula , especially the Keweenaw Peninsula , to work in the area 's mines and lumber industry . The peninsula includes the only counties in the United States where a plurality of residents claim Finnish ancestry .
