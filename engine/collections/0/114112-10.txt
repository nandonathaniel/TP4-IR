After leaving Sportsnight , Gubba moved on to commentate on a range of sports for the BBC . He made regular appearances on Match of the Day , frequently acted as stand - in presenter on Grandstand and the occasional return to Sportsnight , live international football matches and FA Cup matches . This was the era when John Motson and Barry Davies were the BBC 's senior commentators so Gubba rarely got to commentate on games at the highest level , but notable matches he covered were the 1986 World Cup semi-final between France and West Germany , the 1992 Olympic Final , the 1996 Charity Shield and the 2007 League Cup final .
