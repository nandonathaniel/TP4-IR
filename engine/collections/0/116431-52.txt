Given the high proportion of population in rural areas , with limited numbers of students , most communities relied on one - room school houses . Teachers would deal with the range of students of various ages and abilities by using the Monitorial System , an education method that became popular on a global scale during the early 19th century . This method was also known as `` mutual instruction '' or the `` Bell - Lancaster method '' after the British educators Dr Andrew Bell and Joseph Lancaster , who each independently developed it about 1798 . As older children in families would teach younger ones , the abler pupils in these schools became ' helpers ' to the teacher , and taught other students what they had learned .
