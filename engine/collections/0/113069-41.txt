webOS is a proprietary mobile operating system running on the Linux kernel , initially developed by Palm , which launched with the Palm Pre . After being acquired by HP , two phones ( the Veer and the Pre 3 ) and a tablet ( the TouchPad ) running webOS were introduced in 2011 . On August 18 , 2011 , HP announced that webOS hardware was to be discontinued but would continue to support and update webOS software and develop the webOS ecosystem . HP released webOS as open source under the name Open webOS , and plans to update it with additional features . On February 25 , 2013 HP announced the sale of WebOS to LG Electronics , who used the operating system for its current `` smart '' or Internet - connected TVs , but not smartphones . In January 2014 , Qualcomm has announced that it has acquired technology patents from HP , which includes all the WebOS patents .
