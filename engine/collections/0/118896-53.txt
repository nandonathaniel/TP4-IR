The circuit shown to the right is an example of a multi-slope run - down circuit with four run - down slopes with each being ten times more gradual than the previous . The switches control which slope is selected . The switch containing R d / 1000 ( \ displaystyle R_ ( d ) / 1000 ) selects the steepest slope ( i.e. , will cause the integrator output to move toward zero the fastest ) . At the start of the run - down interval , the unknown input is removed from the circuit by opening the switch connected to V i n ( \ displaystyle V_ ( in ) ) and closing the R d / 1000 ( \ displaystyle R_ ( d ) / 1000 ) switch . Once the integrator 's output reaches zero ( and the run - down time measured ) , the R d / 1000 ( \ displaystyle R_ ( d ) / 1000 ) switch is opened and the next slope is selected by closing the R d / 100 ( \ displaystyle R_ ( d ) / 100 ) switch . This repeats until the final slope of R d ( \ displaystyle R_ ( d ) ) has reached zero . The combination of the run - down times for each of the slopes determines the value of the unknown input . In essence , each slope adds one digit of resolution to the result .
