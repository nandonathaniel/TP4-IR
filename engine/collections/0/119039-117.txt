The presentation of the medals and awards changed significantly until the 1932 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles brought in what has now become standard . Before 1932 all the medals were awarded at the closing ceremony , with the athletes wearing evening dress for the first few Games . Originally the presenting dignitary was stationary while the athletes filed past to receive their medals . The victory podium was introduced upon the personal instruction in 1931 of Henri de Baillet - Latour , who had seen one used at the 1930 British Empire Games . The winner is in the middle at a higher elevation , with the silver medallist to the right and the bronze to the left . At the 1932 Winter Olympics , medals were awarded in the closing ceremony , with athletes for each event in turn mounting the first - ever podium . At the Summer Olympics , competitors in the Coliseum received their medals immediately after each event for the first time ; competitors at other venues came to the Coliseum next day to receive their medals . Later Games have had a victory podium at each competition venue .
