It did not take a constitutional amendment to entitle the United States to impose an income tax . Pollock v. Farmers ' Loan & Trust Co. , 157 U.S. 429 , 158 U.S. 601 ( 1895 ) , only held that a tax on the income derived from real or personal property was so close to a tax on that property that it could not be imposed without apportionment . The Sixteenth Amendment removed that barrier . Indeed , the requirement for apportionment is pretty strictly limited to taxes on real and personal property and capitation taxes .
