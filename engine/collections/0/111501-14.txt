In Denmark , a popular clear cola was made by the Cooperative FDB in 1976 . It was especially known for being the `` Hippie Cola '' because of the focus of the harmful effects the color additive could have on children and the boycott of multinational brands . It was inspired by a campaign on harmful additives in Denmark by the Environmental - Organisation NOAH , an independent Danish division of Friends of the Earth . This was followed up with a variety of sodas without artificial coloring . Today many organic colas are available in Denmark , but , for nostalgic reasons , clear cola has still maintained its popularity to a certain degree .
