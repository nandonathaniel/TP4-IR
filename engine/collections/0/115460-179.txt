On April 14 , 2008 , Tesla sued Fisker Automotive , alleging that Henrik Fisker `` stole design ideas and confidential information related to the design of hybrid and electric cars '' and was using that information to develop the Fisker Karma . Tesla had hired Fisker Coachbuild to design the WhiteStar sedan , but rejected the design that Musk considered `` substandard '' . On November 3 , 2008 , Fisker Automotive Inc. issued a press release indicating that an arbiter had issued an interim award finding in Fisker 's favor on all claims .
