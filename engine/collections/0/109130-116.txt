Data security -- At the time of designing IoT companies should ensure that data collection , storage and processing would be secure at all times . Companies should adopt a `` defence in depth '' approach and encrypt data at each stage . Data consent -- users should have a choice as to what data they share with IoT companies and the users must be informed if their data gets exposed . Data minimization -- IoT companies should collect only the data they need and retain the collected information only for a limited time .
