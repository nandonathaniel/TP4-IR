The album 's credits include Clare Torry , a session singer and songwriter , and a regular at Abbey Road . She had worked on pop material and numerous cover albums , and after hearing one of those albums Parsons invited her to the studio to sing on Wright 's composition `` The Great Gig in the Sky '' . She declined this invitation as she wanted to watch Chuck Berry perform at the Hammersmith Odeon , but arranged to come in on the following Sunday . The band explained the concept behind the album , but were unable to tell her exactly what she should do . Gilmour was in charge of the session , and in a few short takes on a Sunday night Torry improvised a wordless melody to accompany Wright 's emotive piano solo . She was initially embarrassed by her exuberance in the recording booth , and wanted to apologise to the band -- only to find them delighted with her performance . Her takes were then selectively edited to produce the version used on the track . For her contribution she was paid £ 30 , equivalent to about £ 360 in 2017 , but in 2004 she sued EMI and Pink Floyd for songwriting royalties , arguing that her contribution to `` The Great Gig in the Sky '' was substantial enough to be considered co-authorship . The High Court agreed with her , but the terms of the settlement were not disclosed . All post-2005 pressings therefore credit Wright and Torry jointly for the song .
