Marbury v. Madison involved a highly partisan set of circumstances . Though Congressional elections were held in November 1800 , the newly elected officers did not take power until March . The Federalist Party had lost the elections . In the words of President Thomas Jefferson , the Federalists `` retired into the judiciary as a stronghold '' . In the four months following the elections , the outgoing Congress created several new judgeships , which were filled by President John Adams . In the last - minute rush , however , Federalist Secretary of State John Marshall had neglected to deliver 17 of the commissions to their respective appointees . When James Madison took office as Secretary of State , several commissions remained undelivered . Bringing their claims under the Judiciary Act of 1789 , the appointees , including William Marbury , petitioned the Supreme Court for the issue of a writ of mandamus , which in English law had been used to force public officials to fulfill their ministerial duties . Here , Madison would be required to deliver the commissions .
