After the fall of communism , the Czech filmmaker Jiří Menzel attempted to make a film from I Served the King of England . Menzel had in the past directed several films based on Hrabal 's stories , such as Closely Watched Trains and Larks on a String . The struggle to get the film made in the transformed film industry became much publicized , and culminated in 1998 , when Menzel , after hearing his producer had sold the rights , attacked the producer at the Karlovy Vary International Film Festival and beat him with a big stick . The stick was later sold at auction . The film rights were passed between different producers , and at one point the story was under development to be turned into a television soap opera . In the early 2000s , a film was under development by the writer - director duo Petr Jarchovský and Jan Hřebejk . In the end Menzel did direct the film . A co-production between Czech , Slovak , German and Hungarian companies , I Served the King of England premiered in the Czech Republic on 21 December 2006 .
