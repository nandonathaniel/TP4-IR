The album features metronomic sound effects during `` Speak to Me '' , and tape loops opening `` Money '' . Mason created a rough version of `` Speak to Me '' at his home , before completing it in the studio . The track serves as an overture and contains cross-fades of elements from other pieces on the album . A piano chord , replayed backwards , serves to augment the build - up of effects , which are immediately followed by the opening of `` Breathe '' . Mason received a rare solo composing credit for `` Speak to Me '' .
