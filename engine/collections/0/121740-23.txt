Most widescreen cathode ray tube ( CRT ) and liquid crystal display ( LCD ) monitors can natively display 1080p content . For example , widescreen WUXGA monitors support 1920x1200 resolution , which can display a pixel for pixel reproduction of the 1080p ( 1920 × 1080 ) format . Additionally , many 23 , 24 , and 27 - inch ( 690 mm ) widescreen LCD monitors use 1920 × 1200 as their native resolution ; 30 inch displays can display beyond 1080p at up to 2560 × 1600 ( 1600p ) . Many 27 '' monitors have native resolutions of 2560 × 1440 and hence operate at 1440p .
