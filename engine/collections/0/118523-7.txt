The 802.11 n draft allows up to 4 x 4 : 4 . Common configurations of 11n devices are 2 x 2 : 2 ; 2 x 3 : 2 ; and 3 x 2 : 2 . All three configurations have the same maximum throughputs and features , and differ only in the amount of diversity the antenna systems provide . In addition , a fourth configuration , 3 x 3 : 3 is becoming common , which has a higher throughput , due to the additional data stream .
