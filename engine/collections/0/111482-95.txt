When Richard Dawson returned as host of the program in 1994 , the round 's name was changed to the `` Bankroll '' round . Although the goal remained of giving only the number - one answer , the format was modified to three questions from five , with only one member of each family participating for all three questions . The initial stake for each family remained the same ( $2,500 in the first half of the hour and $5,000 in the second ) . However , the value for each question was $500 , $1,500 and $2,500 in the first half , with values doubling for the second half . This meant a potential maximum bank of $7,000 in the first half and $14,000 in the second .
