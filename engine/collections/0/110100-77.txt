Economic historians have found that societies in the Northern Hemisphere experience higher standards of living , and that as latitude increases north or south from the equator , levels of real GDP per capita also increases . Climate is closely correlated with agricultural production since without ideal weather conditions , agriculture alone will not produce the surplus supply needed to build and maintain economies . Locations with hot tropical climates often suffer underdevelopment due to low fertility of soils , excessive plant transpiration , ecological conditions favoring infectious diseases , and unreliable water supply . These factors can cause tropical zones to suffer a 30 % to 50 % decrease in productivity relative to temperate climate zones . Tropical infectious diseases that thrive in hot and moist equatorial climates cause thousands of deaths each year . They are also an economic drain on society due to high medical costs , and the unwillingness of foreign capital to invest in a sickly state . Because infectious diseases like malaria often need a warm ecology for growth , states in the mid to high latitudes are naturally protected from the devastating effects of disease .
