Early diagnosis is difficult as the disease often looks early on like a simple superficial skin infection . While a number of laboratory and imaging modalities can raise the suspicion for necrotizing fasciitis , the gold standard for diagnosis is a surgical exploration in the setting of high suspicion . When in doubt , a small incision can be made into the affected tissue , and if a finger easily separates the tissue along the fascial plane , the diagnosis is confirmed and an extensive debridement should be performed .
