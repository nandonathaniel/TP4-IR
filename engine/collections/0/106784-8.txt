Businesses exporting goods and services from New Zealand are entitled to `` zero - rate '' their products : effectively , they charge GST at 0 % . This permits the business to claim back the input GST , but the eventual , non-New Zealand based consumer does not pay the tax ( businesses that produce GST - exempt supplies are not able to claim back input GST ) .
