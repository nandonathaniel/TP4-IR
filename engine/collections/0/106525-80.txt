The strength of the fleet of the Kingdom of England was an important element in the kingdom 's power in the 10th century . At one point Aethelred II had an especially large fleet built by a national levy of one ship for every 310 hides of land , but it is uncertain whether this was a standard or exceptional model for raising fleets . During the period of Danish rule in the 11th century , the authorities maintained a standing fleet by taxation , and this continued for a time under the restored English regime of Edward the Confessor ( reigned 1042 -- 1066 ) , who frequently commanded fleets in person .
