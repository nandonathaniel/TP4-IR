The other type of tiebreaker Van Alen introduced is the `` 12 - point '' tiebreaker that is most familiar and widely used today . Because it ends as soon as either player or team reaches 7 points -- provided that that player or team leads the other at that point by at least two points -- it can actually be over in as few as 7 points . However , because the winning player or team must win by a margin of at least two points , a `` 12 - point '' tiebreaker may go beyond 12 points -- sometimes well beyond . That is why Van Alen derisively likened it to a `` lingering death '' , in contrast to the 9 - point ( or fewer ) `` sudden - death tiebreaker '' that he recommended and preferred .
