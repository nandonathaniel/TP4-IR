Software is usually designed and created ( aka coded / written / programmed ) in integrated development environments ( IDE ) like Eclipse , IntelliJ and Microsoft Visual Studio that can simplify the process and compile the software ( if applicable ) . As noted in a different section , software is usually created on top of existing software and the application programming interface ( API ) that the underlying software provides like GTK+ , JavaBeans or Swing . Libraries ( APIs ) can be categorized by their purpose . For instance , the Spring Framework is used for implementing enterprise applications , the Windows Forms library is used for designing graphical user interface ( GUI ) applications like Microsoft Word , and Windows Communication Foundation is used for designing web services . When a program is designed , it relies upon the API . For instance , if a user is designing a Microsoft Windows desktop application , he or she might use the . NET Windows Forms library to design the desktop application and call its API 's functions like Form1. Close ( ) and Form1. Show ( ) to close or open the application , and write the additional operations him / herself that it needs to have . Without these APIs , the programmer needs to write these functionalities entirely themselves . Companies like Oracle and Microsoft provide their own APIs so that many applications are written using their software libraries that usually have numerous APIs in them .
