On October 25 , 1983 , Reagan ordered U.S. forces to invade Grenada ( codenamed `` Operation Urgent Fury '' ) where a 1979 coup d'Ã©tat had established an independent non-aligned Marxist -- Leninist government . A formal appeal from the Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States ( OECS ) led to the intervention of U.S. forces ; President Reagan also cited an allegedly regional threat posed by a Soviet - Cuban military build - up in the Caribbean and concern for the safety of several hundred American medical students at St. George 's University as adequate reasons to invade . Operation Urgent Fury was the first major military operation conducted by U.S. forces since the Vietnam War , several days of fighting commenced , resulting in a U.S. victory , with 19 American fatalities and 116 wounded American soldiers . In mid-December , after a new government was appointed by the governor - general , U.S. forces withdrew .
