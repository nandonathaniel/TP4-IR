The W3C Internationalisation Activity assures that web technology works in all languages , scripts , and cultures . Beginning in 2004 or 2005 , Unicode gained ground and eventually in December 2007 surpassed both ASCII and Western European as the Web 's most frequently used character encoding . Originally RFC 3986 allowed resources to be identified by URI in a subset of US - ASCII . RFC 3987 allows more characters -- any character in the Universal Character Set -- and now a resource can be identified by IRI in any language .
