Wilson had earlier downplayed Germany 's guilt in starting the war by calling for `` peace without victory '' , but he had taken an increasingly hard stand at Paris and rejected advice to soften the treaty 's treatment of Germany . In a reversal of his earlier position , in summer 1919 Wilson repeatedly stressed Germany 's guilt , saying the treaty , `` seeks to punish one of the greatest wrongs ever done in history , the wrong which Germany sought to do to the world and to civilization ; and there ought to be no weak purpose with regard to the application of the punishment . She attempted an intolerable thing , and she must be made to pay for the attempt . ''
