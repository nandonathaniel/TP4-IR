Mining contributed significantly to preventing potential bankruptcy for the early colonies in Australia . Silver and later copper were discovered in South Australia in the 1840s , leading to the export of ore and the immigration of skilled miners and smelters . The first economic minerals in Australia were silver and lead in February 1841 at Glen Osmond , now a suburb of Adelaide in South Australia . Mines including Wheal Gawler and Wheal Watkins opened soon after . The value of these mines was soon overshadowed by the discovery of copper at Kapunda ( 1842 ) , Burra ( 1845 ) and in the Copper Triangle ( Moonta , Kadina and Wallaroo ) area at the top of Yorke Peninsula ( 1861 ) .
