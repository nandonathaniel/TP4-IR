Five enzymes play a major role in the parallel synthesis pathways for isoleucine , valine , and leucine : threonine dehydrogenase , acetohydroxyacid synthase , ketoacid reductoisomerase , dihydroxyacid dehygrogenase and aminotransferase . Threonine dehydrogenase catalyzes the deamination and dehydration of threonine to 2 - ketobutyrate and ammonia . Isoleucine forms a negative feedback loop with threonine dehydrogenase . Acetohydroxyacid synthase is the first enzyme for the parallel pathway performing condensation reaction in both steps -- condensation of pyruvate to acetoacetate in the valine pathway and condensation of pyruvate and 2 - ketobutyrate to form acetohydroxybtylrate in the isoleucine pathway . Next ketoacid reductisomerase reduces the acetohydroxy acids from the previous step to yield dihydroxyacids in both the valine and isoleucine pathways . Dihydroxyacid dehygrogenase converts the dihyroxyacids in the next step . The final step in the parallel pathway is conducted by amino transferase , which yields the final products of valine and isoleucine . A series of four more enzymes -- isopropylmalate synthase , isopropylmalate isomerase , isopropylmalate dehydrogenase , and aminotransferase -- are necessary for the formation of leucine from 2 - oxolsovalerate .
