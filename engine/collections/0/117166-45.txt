Crucially , Bede seems to identify three phases of settlement : an exploration phase , when mercenaries came to protect the resident population ; a migration phase , which was substantial , as implied by the statement that Anglus was deserted ; and an establishment phase , in which Anglo - Saxons started to control areas , implied in Bede 's statement about the origins of the tribes . This analysis of Bede has led to a re-evaluation , in terms of continuity and change , of Bede 's `` Northumbrian '' view of history and how this view was projected back into the account of the latter two phases of settlement ; and a possible overhaul of the traditional chronological framework .
