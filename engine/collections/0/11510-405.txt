The apparent softening of relations between the two countries was marred by North Korea dispatching general Kim Yong - chol to head the North Korean delegation present at the closing ceremony . The arrival of Kim , held responsible by South Korea for the deaths of dozens of South Korean navy personnel , was met with ' hostility ' but the government did not oppose his presence at the Olympics . The general ended up being seated in the same stand as the daughter of the president of the USA , Ivanka Trump .
