Before publication of the novel , several Hollywood executives and studios declined to create a film based on it , including Louis B. Mayer and Irving Thalberg at Metro - Goldwyn - Mayer ( MGM ) , Pandro Berman at RKO Pictures , and David O. Selznick of Selznick International Pictures . Jack L. Warner liked the story , but Warner Bros. 's biggest star Bette Davis was uninterested , and Darryl Zanuck of 20th Century - Fox did not offer enough money . Selznick changed his mind after his story editor Kay Brown and business partner John Hay Whitney urged him to buy the film rights . In July 1936 -- a month after it was published -- Selznick bought the rights for $50,000 .
