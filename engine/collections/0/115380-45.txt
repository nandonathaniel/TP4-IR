The region of a planetary system adjacent to the giant planets will be influenced in a different way . In such a region , eccentricities of embryos may become so large that the embryos pass close to a giant planet , which may cause them to be ejected from the system . If all embryos are removed , then no planets will form in this region . An additional consequence is that a huge number of small planetesimals will remain , because giant planets are incapable of clearing them all out without the help of embryos . The total mass of remaining planetesimals will be small , because cumulative action of the embryos before their ejection and giant planets is still strong enough to remove 99 % of the small bodies . Such a region will eventually evolve into an asteroid belt , which is a full analog of the asteroid belt in the Solar System , located from 2 to 4 AU from the Sun .
