The Ammonites , led by Nahash , lay siege to Jabesh - Gilead . Under the terms of surrender , the occupants of the city are to be forced into slavery and have their right eyes removed . Instead they send word of this to the other tribes of Israel , and the tribes west of the Jordan assemble an army under Saul . Saul leads the army to victory over the Ammonites , and the people congregate at Gilgal where they acclaim Saul as king and he is crowned ( 1 Samuel 11 ) . Saul 's first act is to forbid retribution against those who had previously contested his kingship .
