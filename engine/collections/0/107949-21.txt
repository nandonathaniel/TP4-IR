She does come back thanks to Luka who finds her at a motel and brings her back . They move in together . Throughout season 11 , Sam and Luka lived together , and Luka was a surrogate father for Alex , even going and meeting with a school official after Alex got caught with an issue of MAXIM magazine . At the end of season 11 , Alex runs away to find Steve ( now played by Garret Dillahunt ) , by hitchhiking after a confrontation with Sam . He is out to find Steve in Colorado , even though Sam has hidden the fact Steve is there because he is in jail on robbery charges . Luka and Sam are frantically searching for him in the opener of season 12 . Sam is desperately worried about Alex because of his diabetes , and his lack of insulin could have resulted in a coma or even death . Sam immediately gets in the car and drives non-stop to Colorado . Luka worries about Sam because they have been driving non-stop , and even hit a deer which completely destroys the windshield . Sam and Luka finally find an exhausted but stable Alex at a Canon City hospital , where he claims he 's okay and that he knows how to take care of himself . At this point , Sam realizes her relationship with Luka is not going to work ; her personal life is too hectic for him to deal with , the two of them have communication problems , and Luka 's special bond with Alex has been eclipsed by Alex 's knowledge that his father is in jail .
