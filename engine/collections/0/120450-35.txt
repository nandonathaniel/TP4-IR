The climate of the Red Sea is the result of two monsoon seasons ; a northeasterly monsoon and a southwesterly monsoon . Monsoon winds occur because of differential heating between the land and the sea . Very high surface temperatures and high salinities make this one of the warmest and saltiest bodies of seawater in the world . The average surface water temperature of the Red Sea during the summer is about 26 ° C ( 79 ° F ) in the north and 30 ° C ( 86 ° F ) in the south , with only about 2 ° C ( 3.6 ° F ) variation during the winter months . The overall average water temperature is 22 ° C ( 72 ° F ) . Temperature and visibility remain good to around 200 m ( 656 ft ) . The sea is known for its strong winds and unpredictable local currents .
