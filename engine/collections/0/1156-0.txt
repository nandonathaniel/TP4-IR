The stratum lucidum ( Latin for `` clear layer '' ) is a thin , clear layer of dead skin cells in the epidermis named for its translucent appearance under a microscope . It is readily visible by light microscopy only in areas of thick skin , which are found on the palms of the hands and the soles of the feet .
