`` Bhagwa or the Saffron denotes renunciation or disinterestedness . Our leaders must be indifferent to material gains and dedicate themselves to their work . The white in the centre is light , the path of truth to guide our conduct . The green shows our relation to ( the ) soil , our relation to the plant life here , on which all other life depends . The `` Ashoka Chakra '' in the centre of the white is the wheel of the law of dharma . Truth or satya , dharma or virtue ought to be the controlling principle of those who work under this flag . Again , the wheel denotes motion . There is death in stagnation . There is life in movement . India should no more resist change , it must move and go forward . The wheel represents the dynamism of a peaceful change . ''
