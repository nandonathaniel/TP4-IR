Scientists from the National Marine Fisheries Service ( NMFS ) have reported that `` the collapsed dorsal fins commonly seen in captive killer whales do not result from a pathogenic condition , but are instead thought to most likely originate from an irreversible structural change in the fin 's collagen over time . Possible explanations for this include : ( 1 ) alterations in water balance caused by the stresses of captivity dietary changes , ( 2 ) lowered blood pressure due to reduced activity patterns , or ( 3 ) overheating of the collagen brought on by greater exposure of the fin to the ambient air . '' According to SeaWorld 's website , another reason for the fin to bend may be the greater amount of time that captive whales spend at the surface , where the fin is not supported by water pressure . The Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society says that dorsal fin collapse is largely explained by captive killer whales swimming in small circles due to the inadequate space in which they have to swim . SeaWorld , however , claims that `` Neither the shape nor the droop of a whale 's dorsal fin are indicators of a killer whale 's health or well - being . ''
