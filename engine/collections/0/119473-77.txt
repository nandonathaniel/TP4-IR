The first scenes of dialogue are Floyd 's encounters on the space station : chit - chat with the colleague who greets him , his telephone call to his daughter , and the friendly but strained encounter with Soviet scientists . Later , en route to the monolith , Floyd engages in trite exchanges with his staff while a spectacular journey by Earth - light across the Lunar surface is shown . Hal is the only character who expresses anxiety , as well as feelings of pride and bewilderment .
