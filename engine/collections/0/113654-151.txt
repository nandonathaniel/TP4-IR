Viruses are an important natural means of transferring genes between different species , which increases genetic diversity and drives evolution . It is thought that viruses played a central role in early evolution , before the diversification of the last universal common ancestor into bacteria , archaea and eukaryotes . Viruses are still one of the largest reservoirs of unexplored genetic diversity on Earth .
