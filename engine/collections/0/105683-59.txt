Arch Linux offers many Ayatana components , including Unity and Unity 2D , via an unofficial repository or through AUR . Fedora does not offer Unity in its default repositories because Unity requires unsupported patches to GTK . However Unity 6 has been ported to Fedora 17 and can be installed through a branch in the openSUSE repositories where the patches are applied . Newer Fedora and Unity versions are not supported . Frugalware had adopted Ayatana , including Unity and Unity 2D , as part of the development branch for an upcoming Frugalware release but the project is no longer maintained . openSUSE offers many Ayatana components for GNOME . After the packager abandoned the project because of problems with the then - current version of Compiz , new developers picked up the task and provide packages for openSUSE 12.2 ( along with versions for Arch Linux and Fedora 17 ) . Newer openSUSE and Unity versions are not supported . Manjaro has a Unity version of its distribution .
