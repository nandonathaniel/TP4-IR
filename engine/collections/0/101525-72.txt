When Thora Hird died in 2003 , Edie was also said to have died . As with her husband Wesley previously , it was not immediately made obvious , but later references to the character indicated that she had died . In the final three series , a framed photo of Edie can be seen on Barry and Glenda 's mantelpiece .
