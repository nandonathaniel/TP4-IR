In April 1914 , American opposition to Huerta culminated in the seizure and occupation of the port of Veracruz by U.S. marines and sailors . Initially intended , in part , to prevent a German merchant vessel from delivering a shipment of arms to the Huerta regime , the muddled operation evolved into a seven - month stalemate resulting in the death of 193 Mexican soldiers , 19 American servicemen , and an unknown number of civilians . The German ship landed its cargo - largely American - made rifles , in a deal brokered by American businessmen - at a different port . U.S. forces eventually left Veracruz in the hands of the Carrancistas , but with lasting damage to U.S. - Mexican relations .
