The Seventh - day Adventist Church formed out of the movement known today as the Millerites . In 1831 , a Baptist convert , William Miller , was asked by a Baptist to preach in their church and began to preach that the Second Advent of Jesus would occur somewhere between March 1843 and March 1844 , based on his interpretation of Daniel 8 : 14 . A following gathered around Miller that included many from the Baptist , Methodist , Presbyterian and Christian Connection churches . In the summer of 1844 , some of Miller 's followers promoted the date of October 22 . They linked the cleansing of the sanctuary of Daniel 8 : 14 with the Jewish Day of Atonement , believed to be October 22 that year . By 1844 , over 100,000 people were anticipating what Miller had called the `` Blessed Hope '' . On October 22 many of the believers were up late into the night watching , waiting for Christ to return and found themselves bitterly disappointed when both sunset and midnight passed with their expectations unfulfilled . This event later became known as the Great Disappointment .
