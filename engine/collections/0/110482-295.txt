The two largest metropolitan areas have subway systems : Lisbon Metro and Metro Sul do Tejo in the Lisbon Metropolitan Area and Porto Metro in the Porto Metropolitan Area , each with more than 35 km ( 22 mi ) of lines . In Portugal , Lisbon tram services have been supplied by the Companhia de Carris de Ferro de Lisboa ( Carris ) , for over a century . In Porto , a tram network , of which only a tourist line on the shores of the Douro remains , began construction on 12 September 1895 ( a first for the Iberian Peninsula ) . All major cities and towns have their own local urban transport network , as well as taxi services .
