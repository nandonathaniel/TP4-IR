Changes regarding the importance and satisfaction of needs from the retrospective peacetime to the wartime due to stress varied significantly across cultures ( the US vs. the Middle East ) . For the US citizens , there was only one level of needs since all needs were considered equally important . With regards to satisfaction of needs during the war , in the US there were three levels : physiological needs , safety needs , and psychological needs ( social , self - esteem , and self - actualization ) . During the war , the satisfaction of physiological needs and safety needs were separated into two independent needs while during peacetime , they were combined as one . For the people of the Middle East , the satisfaction of needs changed from three levels to two during wartime .
