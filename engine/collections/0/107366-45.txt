If debt grows or shrinks slowly as a percentage of GDP , its impact on aggregate demand is small . Conversely , if debt is significant , then changes in the dynamics of debt growth can have significant impact on aggregate demand . Change in debt is tied to the level of debt : if the overall debt level is 10 % of GDP and 1 % of loans are not repaid , this impacts GDP by 1 % of 10 % = 0.1 % of GDP , which is statistical noise . Conversely , if the debt level is 300 % of GDP and 1 % of loans are not repaid , this impacts GDP by 1 % of 300 % = 3 % of GDP , which is significant : a change of this magnitude will generally cause a recession .
