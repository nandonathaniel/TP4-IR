Deserts usually have a large diurnal and seasonal temperature range , with high daytime temperatures falling sharply at night . The diurnal range may be as much as 20 to 30 째 C ( 36 to 54 째 F ) and the rock surface experiences even greater temperature differentials . During the day the sky is usually clear and most of the sun 's radiation reaches the ground , but as soon as the sun sets , the desert cools quickly by radiating heat into space . In hot deserts , the temperature during daytime can exceed 45 째 C ( 113 째 F ) in summer and plunge below freezing point at night during winter .
