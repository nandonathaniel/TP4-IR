Communications are handled by two 230 - watt TWTAs and two coherent transponders . The antenna array consists of a low - gain antenna , a medium - gain antenna and a high - gain antenna . The high - gain antenna system is based on a single 2.2 - metre ( 7 ft 3 in ) reflector illuminated by a feed at S - band . It is used to transmit and receive the telemetry , tracking , commanding and data to and from the Indian Deep Space Network .
