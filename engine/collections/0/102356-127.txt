All of these conditions can be corrected using corrective lenses . For presbyopia and hyperopia , a converging lens provides the extra curvature necessary to bring the near point closer to the eye while for myopia a diverging lens provides the curvature necessary to send the far point to infinity . Astigmatism is corrected with a cylindrical surface lens that curves more strongly in one direction than in another , compensating for the non-uniformity of the cornea .
