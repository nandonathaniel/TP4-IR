In 1899 the Democrat - dominated state legislature ratified a new constitution with a suffrage amendment , whose requirements for poll taxes , literacy tests , lengthier residency , and similar mechanisms disfranchised most blacks and many poor whites . Illiterate whites were protected by a grandfather clause so that if a father or grandfather had voted in 1860 ( when all voters were white ) , his sons or grandsons did not have to pass the literacy test of 1899 . This grandfather clause excluded all blacks , as free people of color had lost the franchise in 1835 . The US Supreme Court ruled in 1915 that such grandfather clauses were unconstitutional . Every voter had to pay the poll tax until it was abolished by the state in 1920 .
