Ludia has also created a Facebook game based on Millionaire , which debuted on March 21 , 2011 . This game features an altered version of the shuffle format , condensing the number of questions to twelve -- eight in round one , and four in round two . A contestant can compete against eight other Millionaire fans in round one , and play round two alone if they make it into the top three . There is no `` final answer '' rule ; the contestant 's responses are automatically locked in . Answering a question correctly earns a contestant the value of that question , multiplied by the number of people who responded incorrectly . Contestants are allowed to use two of their Facebook friends as Jump the Question lifelines in round one , and to use the Ask the Audience lifeline in round two to invite up to 50 such friends of theirs to answer a question for a portion of the prize money of the current question .
