In addition to Raynal 's influence , Toussaint Louverture , a free black , was a key `` enlightened actor '' in the Haitian Revolution . Enlightened thought divided the world into `` enlightened leaders '' and `` ignorant masses '' ; Louverture attempted to bridge this divide between the popular masses and the enlightened few . Louverture was familiar with Enlightenment ideas within the context of European imperialism . He attempted to strike a balance between Western Enlightened thought as a necessary means of winning liberation , and not propagating the notion that it was morally superior to the experiences and knowledge of people of color on Saint Domingue . Louverture wrote a Constitution for a new society in Saint - Domingue that abolished slavery . The existence of slavery in Enlightened society was an incongruity that had been left unaddressed by European scholars . Louverture took on this inconsistency directly in his constitution . In addition , Louverture exhibited a connection to Enlightenment scholars through the style , language and accent of this text .
