Set in the year 1964 , the season follows the patients and staff members of the church - owned Briarcliff Mental Institution , located in Massachusetts , which was founded to treat and house the criminally insane . Kit Walker ( Evan Peters ) , accused of being prolific serial killer `` Bloody Face '' after the disappearance of his wife but claiming that his wife Alma ( Britne Olford ) was abducted by aliens , is incarcerated at Briarcliff . This piques the interest of ambitious journalist Lana Winters ( Sarah Paulson ) , who is yearning to find a story for her big break . At Briarcliff , Kit meets the other patients , many of whom claim to be unjustly institutionalized , including pinhead Pepper ( Naomi Grossman ) , who was framed for her nephew 's murder ; nymphomaniac Shelley ( Chloe Sevigny ) ; and the unassuming Grace Bertrand ( Lizzie Brocher√© ) from France , who appears to be harboring a deep secret of her own . Believed to be a violent serial killer , he becomes the subject of interest of pragmatic psychiatrist Oliver Thredson ( Zachary Quinto ) and the sadistic Dr. Arthur Arden ( James Cromwell ) , the latter of whom routinely conducts scientific operations on patients . The institution is run under the watchful eye of the stern Sister Jude ( Jessica Lange ) , as well as her second - in - command , the naive Sister Mary Eunice ( Lily Rabe ) , and the founder of the institution , Monsignor Timothy Howard ( Joseph Fiennes ) . Briarcliff 's inhabitants are routinely subject to supernatural and scientific influences , including demonic possession and extraterrestrial abduction . The season mostly deals with insanity , with other themes including female sexuality , corrupt ambition , religion versus science , racism , prejudice , death , and faith .
