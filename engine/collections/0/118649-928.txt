Horses exist in numerous realms in Fairy Tale Land as the mode of transportation in Arendelle , Camelot , DunBroch , the Empire , and the Enchanted Forest . Horse racing is also a thing , especially in Camelot as Violet Morgan , an avid horse racer , is gifted Nicodemus by her dying mother . Horses also possess an enchanted heart , just like humans in realms with magic , which can be crushed . The Evil Queen demonstrates this when trying to enact the Dark Curse by using her prized steed , which ultimately fails . When the Dark Curse is cast , some horses are sent to the Land Without Magic .
