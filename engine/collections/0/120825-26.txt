Yet , despite this evidence for empathy - induced altruistic motivation , egoistic explanations may still be possible . For example , one alternative explanation for the problem - specific helping pattern may be that the sequence of events in the same problem condition first made subjects sad when they empathized with the problem and then maintained or enhanced subjects ' sadness when they were later exposed to the same plight . Consequently , the negative state relief model would predict substantial helping among imagine - set subjects in the same condition , which is what occurred . An intriguing question arises from such findings concerning whether it is possible to have mixed motivations for helping . If this is the case , then simultaneous egoistic and altruistic motivations would occur . This would allow for a stronger sadness - based motivation to obscure the effects of an empathic concern - based altruistic motivation . The observed study would then have sadness as less intense than more salient altruistic motivation . Consequently , relative strengths of different emotional reactions , systematically related to the need situation , may moderate the predominance of egoistic or altruistic motivation ( Dovidio , 1990 ) . But it has been shown that researchers in this area who have used very similar procedures sometimes obtain apparently contradictory results . Superficial procedural differences such as precisely when a manipulation is introduced could also lead to divergent results and conclusions . It is therefore vital for any future research to move toward even greater standardization of measurement . Thus , an important step in solving the current theoretical debate concerning the existence of altruism may involve reaching common methodological ground .
