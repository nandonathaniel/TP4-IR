The enormous popularity of Tolkien 's work expanded the demand for fantasy fiction . Largely thanks to The Lord of the Rings , the genre flowered throughout the 1960s , and enjoys popularity to the present day . The opus has spawned many imitators , such as The Sword of Shannara , which Lin Carter called `` the single most cold - blooded , complete rip - off of another book that I have ever read '' . Dungeons & Dragons , which popularized the role - playing game ( RPG ) genre in the 1970s , features many races found in The Lord of the Rings , most notably halflings ( another term for hobbits ) , elves ( who are distinct from dark elves , following Tolkien 's example ) , dwarves , half - elves , orcs , and dragons . However , Gary Gygax , lead designer of the game , maintained that he was influenced very little by The Lord of the Rings , stating that he included these elements as a marketing move to draw on the popularity the work enjoyed at the time he was developing the game .
