Supporting the call for the British to `` Quit India '' , Azad began exhorting thousands of people in rallies across the nation to prepare for a definitive , all - out struggle . As Congress president , Azad travelled across India and met with local and provincial Congress leaders and grass - roots activists , delivering speeches and planning the rebellion . Despite their previous differences , Azad worked closely with Patel and Dr. Rajendra Prasad to make the rebellion as effective as possible . On 7 August 1942 at the Gowalia Tank in Mumbai , Congress president Azad inaugurated the struggle with a vociferous speech exhorting Indians into action . Just two days later , the British arrested Azad and the entire Congress leadership . While Gandhi was incarcerated at the Aga Khan Palace in Pune , Azad and the Congress Working Committee were imprisoned at a fort in Ahmednagar , where they would remain under isolation and intense security for nearly four years . Outside news and communication had been largely prohibited and completely censored . Although frustrated at their incarceration and isolation , Azad and his companions attested to feeling a deep satisfaction at having done their duty to their country and people .
