The first New Year 's Eve celebration in Times Square was held on December 31 , 1904 ; The New York Times ' owner , Adolph Ochs , decided to celebrate the opening of the newspaper 's new headquarters , One Times Square , with a New Year 's fireworks show on the roof of the building to welcome 1905 . Close to 200,000 people attended the event , displacing traditional celebrations that had normally been held at Trinity Church . However , following several years of fireworks shows , Ochs wanted a bigger spectacle at the building to draw more attention to the area . The newspaper 's chief electrician , Walter F. Palmer , suggested using a time ball , after seeing one used on the nearby Western Union Building .
