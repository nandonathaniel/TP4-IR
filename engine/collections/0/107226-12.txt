This song and its scenes were cut from the film , which instead jumps directly from the witch 's castle ( minus the singing Winkie ) to the Wizard 's throne room . Parts of the song 's recording survived and were included in the Deluxe CD soundtrack . The film footage of the celebration is lost , with the exception of a short clip that was actually in the film 's original theatrical trailer , though it had been cut from the film . Viewers of the 1956 television release have reported that the Winkie guards sing this song after the Wicked Witch of the West is killed . It appears that this footage was cut in later broadcast versions to allow insertion of extra commercials .
