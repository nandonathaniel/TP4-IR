In addition to the Holmes canon , Conan Doyle 's 1898 `` The Lost Special '' features an unnamed `` amateur reasoner '' intended to be identified as Holmes by his readers . The author 's explanation of a baffling disappearance argued in Holmesian style , pokes fun at his own creation . Similar Conan Doyle short stories are the early `` The Field Bazaar '' , `` The Man with the Watches '' , and 1924 's `` How Watson Learned the Trick '' , a parody of the Watson -- Holmes breakfast - table scenes . The author wrote other material , especially plays , featuring Holmes . Much of it appears in Sherlock Holmes : The Published Apocrypha , edited by Jack Tracy ; The Final Adventures of Sherlock Holmes , edited by Peter Haining , and The Uncollected Sherlock Holmes , compiled by Richard Lancelyn Green .
