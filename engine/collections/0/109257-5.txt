Taking the five loaves and the two fish and looking up to heaven , he gave thanks and broke the loaves . Then he gave them to the disciples , and the disciples gave them to the people . They all ate and were satisfied , and the disciples picked up twelve baskets full of broken pieces that were left over . The number of those who ate was about five thousand men , beside women and children . In John 's Gospel , the multitude has been attracted around Jesus because of the healing works he has performed , and the feeding of the multitude is taken as a further sign ( Greek : σημεῖον ) that Jesus is the Messiah , the prophet who ( according to the promise in Deuteronomy 18 : 15 ) is to come into the world '' ( John 6 : 14 ) .
