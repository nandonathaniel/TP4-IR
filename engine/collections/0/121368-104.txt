The aim of cognition - oriented treatments , which include reality orientation and cognitive retraining , is the reduction of cognitive deficits . Reality orientation consists in the presentation of information about time , place or person to ease the understanding of the person about its surroundings and his or her place in them . On the other hand , cognitive retraining tries to improve impaired capacities by exercitation of mental abilities . Both have shown some efficacy improving cognitive capacities , although in some studies these effects were transient and negative effects , such as frustration , have also been reported .
