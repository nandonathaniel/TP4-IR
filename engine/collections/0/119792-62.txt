The StarCraft series is supported by eight novelizations , with at least two more in the works , all published by Simon & Schuster . At BlizzCon 2007 , Chris Metzen stated that he hoped to novelize the entirety of StarCraft and Brood War into a definitive text - based story . The first novel , StarCraft : Uprising , was written by Micky Neilson , a Blizzard Entertainment employee , and originally released only as an e-book in December 2000 . The novel follows the origins of the character Sarah Kerrigan . The second novel , entitled StarCraft : Liberty 's Crusade , serves as an adaptation of the first campaign of StarCraft , following on a journalist following a number of the key Terran characters in the series . Written by Jeff Grubb and published in March 2001 , it was the first StarCraft novel to be released in paperback . StarCraft : Shadow of the Xel'Naga , published in July 2001 is the third novel , written by Kevin Anderson under the pseudonym Gabriel Mesta . It serves as a link between StarCraft and Brood War . The fantasy author Tracy Hickman was brought in to write the fourth novel , StarCraft : Speed of Darkness , which was published in June 2002 . Speed of Darkness is written from the viewpoint of a Confederate marine during the early stages of StarCraft . The first four novels , including the e-book Uprising , were later re-released as a single anthology entitled The StarCraft Archive in November 2007 .
