Players control Snake through the game map and attempt to complete missions while avoiding being spotted by the enemy . The threat detection system is revamped , with the removal of the onscreen meter or gauge to indicate the player that they are in the ' alert / evasion / caution ' state as in previous games , which have instead been replaced by visual and audio representations . Snake 's binoculars have also been revamped ; instead of selecting the binoculars as an item , the binoculars are hot keyed to a button . The player is able to mark enemies and be aware of their locations in the iDroid 's holographic display . There are directional cues to help players when an enemy sees them from a distance and gets closer to them . A new `` Reflex Mode '' is activated when an enemy finds Snake and the player only has a short window of time ( in slow motion ) to take out the enemy before he fully sounds the alarm ( a hissing audio cue can be heard if the player is detected by searchlight ) . Lights can be shot out to further aid the player 's stealth efforts .
