Hojagiri is a reflection of the age - old culture and the unique style of dance of the Reang community of Tripura . Only lower half of the body is moved to create rhythmic movements . Dancers performing unusually amazing acrobatic feats is the main highlight of the dance . Reang girls twist and turn and dance in time to the compelling rhythm , sometimes dancing on an earthen pitcher or balancing a bottle on the head with a lighted lamp on top of it .
