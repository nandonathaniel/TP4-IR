The half - life of a radioactive isotope ( usually denoted by t ) is a more familiar concept than the mean - life , so although the equations above are expressed in terms of the mean - life , it is more usual to quote the value of C 's half - life than its mean - life . The currently accepted value for the half - life of C is 5,730 years . This means that after 5,730 years , only half of the initial C will remain ; a quarter will remain after 11,460 years ; an eighth after 17,190 years ; and so on .
