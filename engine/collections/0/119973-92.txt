Beast ( ビースト , Bīsuto ) Beast was one of the first - string members of Noah 's Ark Circus and its animal trainer . Beast grew up alongside the other first - string members in the East End until Baron Kelvin found them and picked them off the streets . Beast is missing her right leg , which was replaced by prosthetic limb . However , her dedication to Kelvin is n't as deep as Joker 's was , and she was willing to leave him behind to live a life with Joker , who she loved , although it was unrequited . On one of the nights that Sebastian had sneaked out , he seduced Beast to use her as a last resort on obtaining the information on Kelvin . She was later killed by Baldroy when she and the other first - string members of the circus ( except for Doll and Snake ) invaded the Phantomhive manor to kidnap Ciel ( unaware that he was n't there at the time ) . She is voiced by Yūko Kaida in Japanese and by Tia Ballard in English .
