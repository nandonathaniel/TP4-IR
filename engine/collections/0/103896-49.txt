In 2000 Apple Records released a thirtieth anniversary edition of the album and Harrison actively participated in its promotion , giving an interview during which he reflected on the work : `` It 's just something that was like my continuation from the Beatles , really . It was me sort of getting out of the Beatles and just going my own way ... it was a very happy occasion . '' He commented on the production : `` Well , in those days it was like the reverb was kind of used a bit more than what I would do now . In fact , I do n't use reverb at all . I ca n't stand it ... You know , it 's hard to go back to anything thirty years later and expect it to be how you would want it now . ''
