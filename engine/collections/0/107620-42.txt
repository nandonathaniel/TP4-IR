Each Caulfield child has literary talent . D.B. writes screenplays in Hollywood ; Holden also reveres D.B. for his writing skill ( Holden 's own best subject ) , but he also despises Hollywood industry - based movies , considering them the ultimate in `` phony '' as the writer has no space for his own imagination , and describes D.B. 's move to Hollywood to write for films as `` prostituting himself '' ; Allie wrote poetry on his baseball glove ; and Phoebe is a diarist . This `` catcher in the rye '' is an analogy for Holden , who admires in children attributes that he struggles to find in adults , like innocence , kindness , spontaneity , and generosity . Falling off the cliff could be a progression into the adult world that surrounds him and that he strongly criticizes . Later , Phoebe and Holden exchange roles as the `` catcher '' and the `` fallen '' ; he gives her his hunting hat , the catcher 's symbol , and becomes the fallen as Phoebe becomes the catcher .
