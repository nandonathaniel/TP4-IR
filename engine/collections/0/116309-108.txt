In civil forfeiture , assets are seized by police based on a suspicion of wrongdoing , and without having to charge a person with specific wrongdoing , with the case being between police and the thing itself , sometimes referred to by the Latin term in rem , meaning `` against the property '' ; the property itself is the defendant and no criminal charge against the owner is needed . If property is seized in a civil forfeiture , it is `` up to the owner to prove that his cash is clean '' and the court can weigh a defendant 's use of their 5th amendment right to remain silent in their decision . In civil forfeiture , the test in most cases is whether police feel there is a preponderance of the evidence suggesting wrongdoing ; in criminal forfeiture , the test is whether police feel the evidence is beyond a reasonable doubt , which is a tougher test to meet . In contrast , criminal forfeiture is a legal action brought as `` part of the criminal prosecution of a defendant '' , described by the Latin term in personam , meaning `` against the person '' , and happens when government indicts or charges the property which is either used in connection with a crime , or derived from a crime , that is suspected of being committed by the defendant ; the seized assets are temporarily held and become government property officially after an accused person has been convicted by a court of law ; if the person is found to be not guilty , the seized property must be returned .
