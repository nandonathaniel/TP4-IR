The Federal Reserve Banks have an intermediate legal status , with some features of private corporations and some features of public federal agencies . The United States has an interest in the Federal Reserve Banks as tax - exempt federally created instrumentalities whose profits belong to the federal government , but this interest is not proprietary . In Lewis v. United States , the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit stated that : `` The Reserve Banks are not federal instrumentalities for purposes of the FTCA ( the Federal Tort Claims Act ) , but are independent , privately owned and locally controlled corporations . '' The opinion went on to say , however , that : `` The Reserve Banks have properly been held to be federal instrumentalities for some purposes . '' Another relevant decision is Scott v. Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City , in which the distinction is made between Federal Reserve Banks , which are federally created instrumentalities , and the Board of Governors , which is a federal agency .
