The song was recorded at Studio A of Gold Star Studios in Los Angeles . When Hatfield and Medley went to record the vocals a few weeks after the song was written , all the instrumental tracks had already been recorded and overdubbed . They would repeat recording the vocal many times - Medley would sing the opening verse over and over again until Spector was satisfied , then the process would be repeated with the next verse . The recording took over 39 takes , and around eight hours over a period of two days .
