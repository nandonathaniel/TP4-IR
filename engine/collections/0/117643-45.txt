The Nets started the 2005 -- 06 season slowly , struggling to a 9 -- 12 record in their first 21 games . However , behind strong play by Carter , Kidd , and Jefferson , the team won their next 10 games ( their final eight games in December and first two games in January ) to surge to top of the division . After the winning streak , the Nets returned to their earlier mediocre play ( winning 13 of their next 29 games ) , but starting on March 12 the Nets won their next 14 games in a row -- the longest winning streak in the NBA that season and matching the franchise record set in 2004 . The streak ended on April 8 , 2006 , when the Nets lost to the Cavaliers 108 -- 102 at home . However , they also set a team record with 20 road victories that season .
