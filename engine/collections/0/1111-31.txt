In restaurants , you often order each dish as you want it , so that they are not ordered all at once at the beginning of the meal . In informal restaurants , you may be required to share a table . If so , do not force conversation : act as if you are seated at a private table . Waitstaff may be summoned by making eye contact ; waving or calling their names is very impolite . Dining etiquette for business meals . Most business meals are lunches . Business meals are generally not good times to discuss business or make business decisions ; they are intended to build the more important personal relationship . Take your cue from your Turkish associates : if they bring up business , then it 's okay to discuss it , but wait to take your lead from their conversation . Water , and other drinks , may not be served until after the meal is over , as some believe that drinking while eating is not healthy .
