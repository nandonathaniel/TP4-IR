The plan to use the gastrocnemius in running , jumping , knee and plantar flexing is created in the precentral gyrus in the cerebrum of the brain . Once a plan is produced , the signal is sent to and down an upper motor neuron . The signal is passed through the internal capsule and decussates , or crosses , in the medulla oblongata , specifically in the lateral corticospinal tract . The signal continues down through the anterior horn of the spinal cord where the upper motor neuron synapses with the lower motor neuron . Signal propagation continues down the anterior rami ( Lumbar 4 - 5 and Sacral 1 - 5 ) of the sacral plexus . The sciatic nerve branches off of the sacral plexus in which the tibial and common fibular nerves are wrapped in one sheath . The tibial nerve eventually separates from the sciatic nerve and innervates the gastrocnemius muscle . Thus , completing the plan the brain had originally started with , so that the actions of running , standing , and jumping could be executed .
