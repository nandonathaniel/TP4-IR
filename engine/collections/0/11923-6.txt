The central festival of Christianity is Easter , on which Christians celebrate their belief that Jesus Christ rose from the dead on the third day after his crucifixion . Even for Easter , however , there is no agreement among the various Christian traditions regarding the date or manner of the observance , less for Christmas , Pentecost , or various other holidays . Both Protestants and Catholics observe certain festivals commemorating events in the life of Christ . Of these , the two most important are Christmas , which commemorates the Birth of Jesus , and Easter , which marks his resurrection .
