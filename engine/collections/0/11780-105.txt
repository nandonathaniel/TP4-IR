All but the last two series have been released on Blu - ray in Australia ( all discs are region - free ) . While it may appear the `` complete collection '' box set includes seven seasons , there are only the first six series included . This is due to Icon entertainment releasing parts 1 & 2 of series four as seasons 4 & 5 respectively . Hence after the fourth season the Australian season numbering is one greater than the series that is included in the release .
