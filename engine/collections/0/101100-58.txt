During the Cold War , various governments developed civil defence programmes aimed to prepare civilian and local government infrastructure for a nuclear strike on the UK . A series of seven Civil Defence Bulletin films were produced in 1964 , and in the 1980s the most famous such programme was probably the series of booklets and public information films entitled Protect and Survive .
