With the competition set to expand , Richmond made a number of misguided moves in 1986 . To fill the vacancy left by Richardson , Richmond wooed high - flying West Australian entrepreneur Alan Bond to become president . Bond came with an agenda to raise money for the club by listing on the stockmarket and relocating to Brisbane . When the latter plan was revealed in the media , a furious reaction from supporters and high - profile club personalities buried the proposal almost immediately . Early in 1987 , Bond 's tenure at the club ended in farce when he resigned without presiding over a single game . The off - field confusion was reflected in the players ' performance as Richmond slumped to only its second wooden spoon in 70 years .
