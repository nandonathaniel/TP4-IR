Although much smaller compared to their peak membership in the 1950s , American unions remain a political factor , both through mobilization of their own memberships and through coalitions with like - minded activist organizations around issues such as immigrant rights , trade policy , health care , and living wage campaigns . Of special concern are efforts by cities and states to reduce the pension obligations owed to unionized workers who retire in the future . Republicans elected with Tea Party support in 2010 , most notably Governor Scott Walker of Wisconsin , have launched major efforts against public sector unions due in part to state government pension obligations along with the allegation that the unions are too powerful . States with higher levels of union membership tend to have higher median incomes and standards of living . It has been asserted by scholars and the International Monetary Fund that rising income inequality in the United States is directly attributable to the decline of the labor movement and union membership .
