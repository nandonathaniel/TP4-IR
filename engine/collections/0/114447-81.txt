Mendelson called the trailer `` a textbook case for unnecessary second pitches ... Is there anyone out there who watched that first teaser back in December and said ' Hmm , it looks good and all , but I need more evidence ' ? '' He added that he was `` a little disappointed by the big Spider - Man reveal , '' having previously wondered , after a Spider - Man character poster was not released with the others , if Marvel would have the `` courage '' to not include the character in any marketing materials before the film 's release , letting the `` Peter Parker scenes the film has to offer be something that is a surprise for theatrical moviegoers and / or something that drives post-opening weekend buzz '' . Mendelson 's colleague at Forbes Mark Hughes felt differently , noting that the trailer was targeting the general audience rather than just fans by giving `` us more explanation ( and context ) of why a clearly major battle is raging between Captain America and Iron Man '' , and by including Spider - Man since `` there are plenty of surprises in these movies , and since we all already know Spider - Man is in Civil War , refusing to let us see him would frankly be a bit weird and pointless ... it 's common for average filmgoers to hear some final bit of information or see some final image and feel compelled , inspired , or otherwise driven to go out to the movies that day . There are any number of factors that can come into play ... and the world needed to see ( Spider - Man ) because it 's the sort of value - added element that can make ( a ) difference '' . Graeme McMillan of The Hollywood Reporter felt that the Spider - Man reveal `` alone makes the trailer '' , describing it as feeling `` like the comic book character come to life . That awkward , voice - cracking , ' hey everyone ' was as humble , playing - it - cool and cocky as he should be . ''
