The double dot was used in the early Cyrillic alphabet , which was used to write Old Church Slavonic . The modern Cyrillic Belarusian and Russian alphabets include the letter yo ⟨ ё ⟩ , although replacing it with the letter ⟨ е ⟩ without the diacritic is allowed in Russian unless doing so would create ambiguity . Since the 1870s , the letter yi ( Ї , ї ) has been used in the Ukrainian alphabet for iotated ( ji ) ; plain і is not iotated ( i ) . In Udmurt , ӥ is used for uniotated ( i ) , with и for iotated ( ji ) .
