Within each group ( each periodic table column ) of metals , reactivity increases with each lower row of the table ( from a light element to a heavier element ) , because a heavier element has more electron shells than a lighter element ; a heavier element 's valence electrons exist at higher principal quantum numbers ( they are farther away from the nucleus of the atom , and are thus at higher potential energies , which means they are less tightly bound ) .
