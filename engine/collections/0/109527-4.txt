Amoebae move and feed by using pseudopods , which are bulges of cytoplasm formed by the coordinated action of actin microfilaments pushing out the plasma membrane that surrounds the cell . Typically , an amoeba moves by extending a pseudopod , attaching it to the substrate and filling it with cytosol , then releasing its rear portion from attachment to the substrate , which results in the organism being propelled forward .
