Only minor trim changes were made to the 1979 Monte Carlo which included a restyled grille , revised parking lamp detail and new wrap - around taillamps . Mechanical changes included a new Chevrolet - built 200 CID V6 ( the ancestor of the Vortec 4300 ) as the standard engine for the base Monte Carlo in 49 states while the Buick 231 CID V6 remained standard on base models in California and all Landau models . A new 125 hp ( 93 kW ) 267 CID V8 became optional and the 140 hp ( 100 kW ) 305 CID V8 continued as an option but was joined by a 160 hp 235 lbf ft ( 319 N m ) version with a four - barrel carburetor . The same transmissions were carried over from 1978 , including a standard three - speed manual and optional four - speed manual , or an optional three - speed Turbo Hydramatic automatic . This would be the last year that Chevrolet would offer manual transmissions on the Monte Carlo due to extremely low buyer interest .
