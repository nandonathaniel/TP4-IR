After a blown engine at California and falling to 35th in the owners points , he finished 10th at Las Vegas and reached 29th place in points . He finished 8th at Martinsville . He had a string of poor finishes including 20th at Texas , and 31st at Phoenix after being spun out by Casey Mears .

However , two weeks later at Richmond , Earnhardt finished 27th . He was again spun out late in the race at Darlington and ended the race in 27th place . He then finished 10th in the All - Star race at Lowe 's Motor Speedway . Earnhardt 's poor performance continued as he finished in 40th at the Coca Cola 600 due to an ill - handling race car .
