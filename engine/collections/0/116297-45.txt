With the series canceled , Fell approached Three 's Company producers about the Ropers returning to the show , however during the time The Ropers was on the air , the landlord characters had been replaced on Three 's Company by Ralph Furley ( Don Knotts ) . The addition had worked well and Three 's Company had retained its popularity . The idea of returning Fell and Lindley to their original Three 's Company roles was undesirable to producers and ABC , mainly because they had one character playing the landlord role now as opposed to two , which would require more money to be paid out per episode ; the cancellation of The Ropers came just as Suzanne Somers began to renegotiate her contract , which would lead to her very public contract dispute during the 1980 - 81 television season that led to her departure from the series . The cancellation of The Ropers came just one month after the one - year contractual deadline had passed . Fell would later state that he always believed the decision to pull the plug on the show had been made much earlier , but that the network deliberately postponed making the cancellation official until after the one - year mark specifically to be relieved of the obligation to allow Fell and Lindley to return to Three 's Company . There was an attempt by producers to sell the show to Silverman over at NBC ; Silverman , however , passed on it too .
