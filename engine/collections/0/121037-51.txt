Jean - Fran√ßois Lyotard ( 1924 -- 1998 ) defined postmodernism as scepticism toward metanarratives . A metanarrative is a kind of grand arching story that encompasses - and claims to predict - everything . An example is Marxism , which explains the communist as the inevitable historical synthesis of the proletariat and capitalist of modern capitalist class division . Lyotard considered the metanarrative an essential feature of modernity . Hence the postmodern condition is the replacement of metanarratives with a multiplicity of micro-narratives , or to call them the appellation Lyotard gave them , language games . Lyotard maintained that these language games lack any all - embracing structure but were brought about by technological developments in such fields as communication and mass media making metanarratives indefensible .
