Bertell Dache , a black demo singer for the Brill Building songwriters , recorded an answer song entitled `` Not just Tomorrow , But Always '' . It has been erroneously claimed by some historians that Dache was a pseudonym for Epic recording artist Tony Orlando , whose recording of the original song had not been released as Don Kirshner thought the lyric was convincing only as sung by a woman . However , an ad for United Artists Records which appeared in Billboard during 1961 featured a photo of the singer which conclusively proved that Dache was not Tony Orlando .
