V.A. Shiva Ayyadurai ( born Vellayappa Ayyadurai Shiva , Marathi : वेल्लियप्पा अय्यदुरई शिव ; December 2 , 1963 ) is an Indian - born American scientist and entrepreneur . Ayyadurai is notable for his controversial claim to be the `` inventor of email '' , based on the electronic mail software called `` EMAIL '' he wrote as a New Jersey high school student in the late 1970s . Initial reports that repeated Ayyadurai 's assertion -- from organizations such as The Washington Post and the Smithsonian Institution -- were followed by public retractions . These corrections were triggered by objections from historians and ARPANET pioneers who pointed out that email was already actively used in the early 1970s .
