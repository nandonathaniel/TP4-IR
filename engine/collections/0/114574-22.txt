Subjectivists assign numbers per subjective probability , i.e. , as a degree of belief . The degree of belief has been interpreted as , `` the price at which you would buy or sell a bet that pays 1 unit of utility if E , 0 if not E . '' The most popular version of subjective probability is Bayesian probability , which includes expert knowledge as well as experimental data to produce probabilities . The expert knowledge is represented by some ( subjective ) prior probability distribution . These data are incorporated in a likelihood function . The product of the prior and the likelihood , normalized , results in a posterior probability distribution that incorporates all the information known to date . By Aumann 's agreement theorem , Bayesian agents whose prior beliefs are similar will end up with similar posterior beliefs . However , sufficiently different priors can lead to different conclusions regardless of how much information the agents share .
