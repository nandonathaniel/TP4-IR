Pre-production began around August 2008 , with del Toro , Jackson , Walsh and Philippa Boyens writing the scripts . Del Toro collaborated with Jackson , Walsh and Boyens via videoconferencing and flew every three weeks , back and forth from Los Angeles ( where some of the designs were done ) to New Zealand to visit them . Del Toro spent his mornings writing and afternoons looking at material related to Tolkien to help him understand the writer 's work . He watched World War I documentaries and asked for book recommendations from Jackson , who is a collector of World War I memorabilia . Del Toro felt Tolkien 's experiences in that war influenced his stories .
