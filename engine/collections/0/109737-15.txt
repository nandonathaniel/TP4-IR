New York City 's Central Park , an oasis that functions as the city 's `` green lung '' , was in a state of deterioration in the mid-1970s . Though Central Park had been designated a National Historic Landmark in 1962 , at the start of the 1980s , the city lacked the financial resources to spend an estimated US $3,000,000 to restore or even to maintain the park . The nonprofit Central Park Conservancy was founded in 1980 , and began a successful campaign to raise renovation funds .
