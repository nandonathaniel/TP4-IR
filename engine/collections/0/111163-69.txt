Class prediction analysis : This approach , called supervised classification , establishes the basis for developing a predictive model into which future unknown test objects can be input in order to predict the most likely class membership of the test objects . Supervised analysis for class prediction involves use of techniques such as linear regression , k - nearest neighbor , learning vector quantization , decision tree analysis , random forests , naive Bayes , logistic regression , kernel regression , artificial neural networks , support vector machines , mixture of experts , and supervised neural gas . In addition , various metaheuristic methods are employed , such as genetic algorithms , covariance matrix self - adaptation , particle swarm optimization , and ant colony optimization . Input data for class prediction are usually based on filtered lists of genes which are predictive of class , determined using classical hypothesis tests ( next section ) , Gini diversity index , or information gain ( entropy ) .
