Unveiled at Detroit , MI Cobo Hall on June 16 , 1998 , the redesigned WJ 1999 Grand Cherokee shared just 127 parts with its predecessor ( mostly fasteners ) and took 28 months to develop from its March 1996 design freeze ( styling approval in Q3 1995 ) . The spare tire was relocated from the side of the cargo compartment to under the floor . The two heavy pushrod V8 engines were replaced by Chrysler 's then - new PowerTech . New V8 engine produced less torque than the old pushrods , but was lighter , offered better fuel economy , and provided similar on road performance figures ( the 23 - gallon fuel tank was replaced with one of a 20.5 - gallon capacity ) . The Inline 6 engine was also updated for MY1999 . A redesign of the intake manifold added 10 horsepower ( 7.5 kW ) . While other Jeep vehicles used the Mopar 5 x 4.5 bolt circle , this was the first Jeep following the 1987 Chrysler buyout to receive a wider wheel bolt pattern : -- 5 x 5 - ( metric 5 x 127mm ) . Models include MY1999 - 2009 Grand Cherokee , MY2006 - 2009 Grand Cherokee SRT - 8 , WK MY2005 - 2010 , WK2 MY2011 - 2016 .
