Like most archetypical villains , Voldemort 's arrogance leads to his downfall . He also suffers from a pathological fear of death , which he regards as a shameful and ignominious human weakness . However , while he had many traits of a megalomaniac , he did not have all , as one common trait associated with megalomania and narcissists was shifting blame . Voldemort admitted he paid an expensive price in attacking the parents of Harry Potter , and carefully studied what went wrong when reorganizing his Death Eaters , ultimately placing the blame upon himself . According to Rowling , his Boggart would be his own corpse . Rowling also said that the difference between Harry and Voldemort is that Harry accepts mortality , and thus Harry is in the end stronger than his nemesis .
