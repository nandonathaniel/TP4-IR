Presenters could now directly control their own overheads and would no longer have to work through the person with the typewriter . PowerPoint handled the task of making the overheads all look alike ; one change reformats them all . Typographic fonts were better than an Orator typeball , and charts and diagrams could be imported from MacDraw , MacPaint , and Excel , thanks to the new Mac clipboard .
