King Philip 's War , also called Metacom 's War or Metacom 's Rebellion , was the last major armed conflict between Native American inhabitants of present - day southern New England and English colonists and their Native American allies from 1675 to 1676 . It continued in northern New England ( primarily on the Maine frontier ) even after King Philip was killed , until a treaty was signed at Casco Bay in April 1678 .
