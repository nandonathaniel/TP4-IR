Wadi El Amud between Safed and the Sea of Galilee was the site of the first prehistoric dig in Palestine , in 1925 . The discovery of Palestine Man in the Zuttiyeh Cave in Wadi Al - Amud near Safed in 1925 provided some clues to human development in the area . Qafzeh is a paleoanthropological site south of Nazareth where eleven significant fossilised Homo sapiens skeletons have been found at the main rock shelter . These anatomically modern humans , both adult and infant , are now dated to about 90 -- 100,000 years old , and many of the bones are stained with red ochre , which is conjectured to have been used in the burial process , a significant indicator of ritual behavior and thereby symbolic thought and intelligence . 71 pieces of unused red ochre also littered the site . Mount Carmel has yielded several important findings , among them Kebara Cave that was inhabited between 60,000 -- 48,000 BP and where the most complete Neanderthal skeleton found to date . The Tabun cave was occupied intermittently during the Lower and Middle Paleolithic ages ( 500,000 to around 40,000 years ago ) . Excavations suggest that it features one of the longest sequences of human occupation in the Levant . In the nearby Es Skhul cave excavations revealed the first evidence of the late Epipalaeolithic Natufian culture , characterized by the presence of abundant microliths , human burials and ground stone tools . This also represents one area where Neanderthals -- present in the region from 200,000 to 45,000 years ago -- lived alongside modern humans dating to 100,000 years ago . In the caves of Shuqba in Ramallah and Wadi Khareitun in Bethlehem , stone , wood and animal bone tools were found and attributed to the Natufian culture ( c . 12,800 -- 10,300 BCE ) . Other remains from this era have been found at Tel Abu Hureura , Ein Mallaha , Beidha and Jericho .
