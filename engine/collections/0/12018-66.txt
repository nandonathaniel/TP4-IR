At the 2010 SHOT Show , Glock presented the `` fourth generation '' , now dubbed `` Gen4 '' by Glock itself . Updates centered on ergonomics and the recoil spring assembly . Some parts of fourth - generation Glock pistols can not be interchanged with those of the previous generations . The initial two fourth - generation models announced were the full - sized Glock 17 and Glock 22 , chambered for the 9 Ã— 19 mm Parabellum and . 40 S&W cartridges , respectively . The pistols were displayed with a modified rough - textured frame , grip checkering , and interchangeable backstraps of different sizes . `` Gen4 '' is rollmarked on the slide next to the model number to identify the fourth - generation pistols .
