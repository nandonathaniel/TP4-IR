Downstate New York , comprising New York City , Long Island , and lower portions of the Hudson Valley , has rather warm summers with some periods of high humidity and cold , damp winters which are relatively mild compared to temperatures in Upstate New York due to downstate region 's lower elevation , proximity to the Atlantic Ocean , and relatively lower latitude . Upstate New York experiences warm summers , marred by only occasional , brief intervals of sultry conditions , with long and cold winters . Western New York , particularly the Tug Hill region , receives heavy lake - effect snows , especially during the earlier portions of winter , before the surface of Lake Ontario itself is covered by ice . The summer climate is cool in the Adirondacks , Catskills , and at higher elevations of the Southern Tier .
