This is the sixth month in the Islamic calendar ( a lunar calendar ) and every year the holiday falls on a different day of the Gregorian calendar . This is the birthday anniversary of Fatimah , Prophet Muhammad 's only daughter according to Shia Islam . On this day , banners reading `` Ya Fatemeah ( O ! Fatemeh ) '' are displayed on `` government buildings , private buildings , public streets and car windows . '' Mother 's Day was originally observed on 16 December but the date was changed after the Iranian Revolution in 1979 . The celebration is both Women 's Day ( replacing International Women 's Day ) and Mother 's Day .
