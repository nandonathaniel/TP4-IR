Cristina had not yet graduated when they moved to RÃ­o Gallegos , and completed the remaining subjects with distance education . There have been claims made that she never graduated , and that she may have worked as a lawyer without having a degree . This idea was proposed by the constitutionalist Daniel Sabsay , and fueled by the reluctance of the National University of La Plata ( UNLP ) to release her degree . She registered at the Tribunal Superior de Justicia of Santa Cruz in 1980 , the Comodoro Rivadavia 's chamber of appeals in 1985 , and worked as an attorney for the Justicialist Party in 1983 . There are also logs of minor cases where she acted as a lawyer . The claim has been sent to trial four times , and the judges Norberto Oyarbide , Ariel Lijo , Sergio Torres , and Claudio Bonadio all ruled that she has a degree .
