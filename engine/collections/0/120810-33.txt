Kilgrave is the main antagonist of season 1 of Jessica Jones , portrayed by David Tennant as an adult while his child appearance was portrayed by James Freedson - Jackson . He has several differences from the comic book character . Instead of the purple skin of the comics , this version wears purple clothing and his real name is Kevin Thompson . He does not secrete pheromones , but infects the people around him with a virus to control them . Unlike his comic book counterpart , this version of Kilgrave can control any number of people by simply giving oral commands and can order anyone to do anything he tells them without being physically present . However , his commands can only be followed within one day before it wears off . His powers came from the experiments done by his scientific parents Louise and Albert Thompson . Ever since using her to kill Reva Connors , Kilgrave has been obsessed with Jessica while he has had her in his control , and spends the show 's first season trying to `` prove his love '' to her by creating chaos for her to solve . In the season finale , Jessica Jones kills Kilgrave by snapping his neck . Jeri Hogarth later got her exonerated for this murder . In 2016 , Rolling Stone ranked him # 40 of their `` 40 Greatest TV Villains of All Time '' . It was announced in August 2017 that David Tennant would reprise the role of Kilgrave in the show 's second season . Although Kilgrave does not appear in Luke Cage , Mariah Dillard mentions his death in her rally at Harlem 's Paradise as she and Willis `` Diamondback '' Stryker are pushing their plans to arm the NYPD with Judas bullets .
