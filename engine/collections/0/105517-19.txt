The soft - serve formula was first developed in 1938 by Douds , Iowa - born John Fremont `` J.F. '' `` Grandpa '' McCullough ( 1871 â€’ 1963 ) and his son Alex . They convinced friend and loyal customer Sherb Noble to offer the product in his ice cream store in Kankakee , Illinois . On the first day of sales , Noble dished out more than 1,600 servings of the new dessert within two hours . Noble and the McCulloughs went on to open the first Dairy Queen store in 1940 in Joliet , Illinois . While this Dairy Queen has not been in operation since the 1950s , the building still stands at 501 N Chicago St. as a city - designated landmark .
