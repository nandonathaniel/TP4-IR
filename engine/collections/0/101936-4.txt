This method can be used to measure the volume of a solid object , even if its form is not regular . Several methods of such measuring exist . In one case the increase of liquid level is registered as the object is immersed in the liquid ( usually water ) . In the second case , the object is immersed into a vessel full of liquid ( called an overflow can ) , causing it to overflow . Then the spilled liquid is collected and its volume measured . In the third case , the object is suspended under the surface of the liquid and the increase of weight of the vessel is measured . The increase in weight is equal to the amount of liquid displaced by the object , which is the same as the volume of the suspended object times the density of the liquid .
