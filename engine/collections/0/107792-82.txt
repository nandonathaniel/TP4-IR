Among others , Robert Watson had a role in the science assessment and in the regulation efforts of ozone depletion and global warming . Prior to the 1980s , the EU , NASA , NAS , UNEP , WMO and the British government had dissenting scientific reports and Watson played a role in the process of unified assessments . Based on the experience with the ozone case , the IPCC started to work on a unified reporting and science assessment to reach a consensus to provide the IPCC Summary for Policymakers .
