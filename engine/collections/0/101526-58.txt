The cost , size , and power consumption of electronic circuitry was relatively high throughout the infancy of the information age . Consequently , all serial computers and many early computers , such as the PDP - 8 , had a simple ALU that operated on one data bit at a time , although they often presented a wider word size to programmers . One of the earliest computers to have multiple discrete single - bit ALU circuits was the 1948 Whirlwind I , which employed sixteen of such `` math units '' to enable it to operate on 16 - bit words .
