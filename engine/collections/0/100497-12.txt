The oversight body of the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination found that juvenile life without a chance of parole is applied disproportionately to black minors , and the U.S. has done nothing to reduce what has become pervasive discrimination . The Committee recommended that the U.S. discontinue the use of this sentence against persons under the age of eighteen at the time the offense was committed , and review the situation of persons already serving such sentences .
