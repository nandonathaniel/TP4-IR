Though not every individual has to receive every sacrament , the Church affirms that , for believers as a whole , the sacraments are necessary for salvation , as the modes of grace divinely instituted by Christ himself . Through each of them , Christ bestows that sacrament 's particular grace , such as incorporation into Christ and the Church , forgiveness of sins , or consecration for a particular service .
