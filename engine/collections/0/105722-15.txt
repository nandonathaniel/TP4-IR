After the bones were prepared , photographed and studied , they were sent to New Jersey where work began on making the mount . This work consists of bending steel to support each bone safely and to display the entire skeleton articulated as it was in life . The real skull was not incorporated into the mount as subsequent study would be difficult with the head 4 m ( 13 ft ) off the ground . Parts of the skull had been crushed and broken , and thus appeared distorted . The museum made a cast of the skull , and altered this cast to remove the distortions , thus approximating what the original undistorted skull may have looked like . The cast skull was also lighter , allowing it to be displayed on the mount without the use of a steel upright under the head . The original skull is exhibited in a case that can be opened to allow researchers access for study .
