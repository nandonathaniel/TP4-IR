The scale used to indicate magnitude originates in the Hellenistic practice of dividing stars visible to the naked eye into six magnitudes . The brightest stars in the night sky were said to be of first magnitude ( m = 1 ) , whereas the faintest were of sixth magnitude ( m = 6 ) , which is the limit of human visual perception ( without the aid of a telescope ) . Each grade of magnitude was considered twice the brightness of the following grade ( a logarithmic scale ) , although that ratio was subjective as no photodetectors existed . This rather crude scale for the brightness of stars was popularized by Ptolemy in his Almagest and is generally believed to have originated with Hipparchus .
