Popular mainstream media frequently portray Pope Francis either as a progressive papal reformer or with liberal , moderate values . The Vatican has claimed that Western news outlets often seek to portray his message with a less - doctrinal tone of papacy , in hopes of extrapolating his words to convey a more merciful and tolerant message . In the news media , both faithful and non-believers often refer to a `` honeymoon '' phase in which the Pope has changed the tone on Catholic doctrines and supposedly initiated ecclesiastical reform in the Vatican . Media systems differ , too , not only in their coverage of Francis 's stances but also in how individual events are portrayed . His 2015 trip to Cuba is a prime example . During this trip , American - based AP and British - based Reuters highlighted the religious aspect of the pope 's journey while Prensa Latina , the official state media agency , depicted it as a diplomatic visit . American and British media were also more likely during this trip to show Francis interacting with regular Cubans compared to the official Cuban media , which showed Francis interacting with elites most often .
