The BSA 's stated purpose at its incorporation in 1910 was `` to teach ( boys ) patriotism , courage , self - reliance , and kindred values . '' Later , in 1937 , Deputy Chief Scout Executive George J. Fisher expressed the BSA 's mission : `` Each generation as it comes to maturity has no more important duty than that of teaching high ideals and proper behavior to the generation which follows . '' The current mission statement of the BSA is `` to prepare young people to make ethical and moral choices over their lifetimes by instilling in them the values of the Scout Oath and Law . '' The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter - day Saints was the first partner to sponsor Scouting in the United States , adopting the program in 1913 as part of its Mutual Improvement Association program for young men . In May 2018 , the Mormon church announced that , effective year - end 2019 , it would no longer sponsor scouting units ( packs , troops , crews , ships , posts ) with the Boy Scouts of America to focus on its own global youth leadership and development program , although Mormon youth are free to join scouting units sponsored by other organizations .
