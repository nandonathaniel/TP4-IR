The earliest known attempt to specifically hunt a fox with hounds was in Norfolk , in the East of England , in 1534 , where farmers began chasing down foxes with their dogs as a form of pest control . Packs of hounds were first trained specifically to hunt foxes in the late 17th century , with the oldest such fox hunt likely to be the Bilsdale in Yorkshire . By the end of the 17th century , many organised packs were hunting both hare and fox .
