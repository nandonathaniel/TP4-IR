The Homestead Acts were several United States federal laws that gave an applicant ownership of land , typically called a `` homestead , '' at no cost . In all , more than 270 million acres of public land , or nearly 10 % of the total area of the U.S. , was given away free to 1.6 million homesteaders ; most of the homesteads were west of the Mississippi River .
