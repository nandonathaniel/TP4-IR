B.R. Ambedkar , the founder of the Dalit Buddhist movement , declared that Buddhism offered an opportunity for low - caste and untouchable Hindus to achieve greater respect and dignity because of its non-caste doctrines . Among the 22 vows he prescribed to his followers is an injunction against having faith in Brahma , Vishnu and Mahesh . He also regarded the belief that the Buddha was an incarnation of Vishnu as `` false propaganda '' .
