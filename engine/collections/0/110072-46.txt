The Knockout Rounds were also introduced in season three . A pair of artists within a team are selected to sing individual performances in succession . They are not told until a few minutes prior to their performances who their partner is . The artists get to choose their own songs in this round , although they continue to get help and advice from their respective coaches . At the conclusion of the performances , coaches would decide which one of each pair gets to advance to the next round . Just like in the battle rounds , the coaches can steal one eliminated artist from another coach starting with season five .
