Fans were permitted , often invited , to watch episodes being shot each week . Cast members were known to speak with their fans and sign autographs during shooting breaks . During the show 's final season run , an official website was established , which remains active . Two fans went on to create the Dr. Quinn Times , a newsletter in which interviews with the cast , producers , directors , and technical specialists were conducted and distributed to fans , twice each year .
