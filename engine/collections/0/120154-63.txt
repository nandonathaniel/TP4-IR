The film depicts Lindsay , having already won a medal in the 400 - metre hurdles , giving up his place in the 400 - metre race for Liddell . In fact Burghley , on whom Lindsay is loosely based , was eliminated in the heats of the 110 hurdles ( he would go on to win a gold medal in the 400 hurdles at the 1928 Olympics ) , and was not entered for the 400 metres .
