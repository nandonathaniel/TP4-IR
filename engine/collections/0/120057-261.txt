The Bookworm is a green toy worm with a built - in flashlight who wears glasses . He is a genius who loves reading books . He keeps a library of instruction manuals in a closet at Sunnyside , and gives Lotso the instruction manual for Buzz Lightyear . He later gives the same manual to Barbie ( who he thinks is Ken since she is disguised in his spacesuit outfit ) . It is unknown if he is in allegiance with Lotso but is most likely not , since he is never seen with him very often . In the credits , he is happy without Lotso , and is seen using his flashlight to light a disco ball during a party at Sunnyside . He is based on the Glo Worm toys from the 1980s . He only has two lines in the film .
