The 4th DCr ( de Gaulle ) , attempted to launch an attack from the south at Montcornet , where Guderian had his Korps headquarters and the 1st Panzer Division had its rear service areas . During the Battle of Montcornet Germans hastily improvised a defence while Guderian rushed up the 10th Panzer Division to threaten de Gaulle 's flank . This flank pressure and dive - bombing by Fliegerkorps VIII ( General Wolfram von Richthofen ) broke up the attack . French losses on 17 May amounted to 32 tanks and armoured vehicles but the French had `` inflicted loss on the Germans '' . On 19 May , after receiving reinforcements , de Gaulle attacked again and was repulsed with the loss of 80 of 155 vehicles . Fliegerkorps VIII attacked French units massing on the German flanks and prevented most counter-attacks from starting . The defeat of the 4th DCr and the disintegration of the French Ninth Army was caused mainly by the fliegerkorps . The 4th DCr had achieved a measure of success but the attacks on 17 and 19 May had only local effect .
