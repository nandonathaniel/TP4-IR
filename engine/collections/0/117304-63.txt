( Idolatry ) consists not merely in erecting an image and worshiping it , but rather in the heart , which stands gaping at something else , and seeks help and consolation from creatures , saints , or devils , and neither cares for God , nor looks to Him for so much good as to believe that He is willing to help , neither believes that whatever good it experiences comes from God .
