With its towers of oxidised silver and bronze - coloured stainless steel under a canopy of lights , it opened as Festival Disney . For a projected daily attendance of 55,000 , Euro Disney planned to serve an estimated 14,000 people per hour inside the Euro Disneyland park . In order to accomplish this , 29 restaurants were built inside the park ( with a further 11 restaurants built at the Euro Disney resort hotels and five at Festival Disney ) . Menus and prices were varied with an American flavour predominant and Disney 's precedent of serving alcoholic beverages was continued in the park .
