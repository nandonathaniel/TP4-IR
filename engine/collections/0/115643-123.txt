Jenkins disagrees with this line of critique , however . She has stated that she was raised by a second - wave `` feminist mother '' , who taught her to be `` both super aware that there had been sexism but also : ' Congratulations -- thank you , now I get to do whatever I want , Mom ! ' '' Jenkins thus notes that it is this upbringing which has led her to question a feminist critique of Wonder Woman 's costume . When she was working on her own version of Wonder Woman 's `` Gladiator '' re-design of the outfit ( in the 2016 film Batman v Superman : Dawn of Justice ) Jenkins decided that Wonder Woman ( as well as the other Amazons ) `` should n't be dressed in armor like men ( ... ) It should be different ( ... ) I , as a woman , want Wonder Woman to be hot as hell , fight badass , and look great at the same time -- the same way men want Superman to have huge pecs and an impractically big body . '' Jenkins also notes that she is `` frustrated '' by the critique of Wonder Woman 's appearance , stating `` when people get super critical about her outfit , who 's the one getting crazy about what a woman wears ? That 's who she is ; that 's Wonder Woman . '' Gal Gadot concurred with Jenkins , arguing that the character `` is a feminist '' as `` feminism is about equality and choice and freedom . And the writers , Patty and myself all figured that the best way to show that is to show Diana as having no awareness of social roles . She has no gender boundaries . To her , everyone is equal . ''
