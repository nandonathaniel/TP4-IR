Hurricane s have played key -- and devastating -- roles in Belizean history . In 1931 , an unnamed hurricane destroyed over two - thirds of the buildings in Belize City and killed more than 1,000 people . In 1955 , Hurricane Janet levelled the northern town of Corozal . Only six years later , Hurricane Hattie struck the central coastal area of the country , with winds in excess of 300 km / h ( 186 mph ) and 4 m ( 13.1 ft ) storm tide s . The devastation of Belize City for the second time in thirty years prompted the relocation of the capital some 80 kilometres ( 50 mi ) inland to the planned city of Belmopan .
