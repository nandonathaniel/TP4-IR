In 1931 local and municipal elections produced victories ( particularly in urban areas ) for candidates favoring an end to the monarchy and the establishment of a republic . Faced with unrest in the cities , Alfonso XIII went into exile , but did not abdicate . The ensuing provisional government evolved into the relatively short - lived Second Spanish Republic . The Spanish Civil War began in 1936 and ended on 1 April 1939 with the victory of General Francisco Franco and his coalition of allied organizations commonly referred to as the Nationalists . Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany aided Franco in the Spanish Civil War .
