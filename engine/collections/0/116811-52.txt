Flinch : James and a group of guests participate in a game where pieces of fruit are fired out of a mini remote controlled cannon , designed as Corden 's face , towards one of the guests standing behind a plastic wall . Corden usually distracts the guest by asking them questions and then tries to make them flinch by unexpectedly firing a piece of fruit mid-conversation . The winner usually is the one who flinches the least .
