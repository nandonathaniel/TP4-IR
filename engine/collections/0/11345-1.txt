The table below ranks all United States Supreme Court Justices by time in office . For five individuals confirmed for associate justice , and later confirmed for chief justice separately -- Charles Evans Hughes , William Rehnquist , John Rutledge , Harlan F. Stone , and Edward Douglass White -- their cumulative length of service on the Court is measured . The basis of the ranking is the difference between dates ; if counted by number of calendar days all the figures would be one greater , with the exception of Charles Evans Hughes and John Rutledge , who would receive two days , as each served on the Court twice ( their service as associate justice and as chief justice was separated by a period of years off the Court ) . The start date given for each justice is the day he or she took the prescribed oath of office , with the end date being the date of the justice 's death , resignation , or retirement . A highlighted row indicates a justice currently serving on the Court .
