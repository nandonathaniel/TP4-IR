In the Middle Ages the power of holy water was considered so great that in some places fonts had locked covers to prevent the theft of holy water for unauthorized magic practices . The Constitutions of Archbishop Edmund Rich ( 1236 ) prescribe that `` Fonts are to be kept under lock and key , because of witchcraft ( sortilegia ) . Similarly the chrism and sacred oil are kept locked up . ''
