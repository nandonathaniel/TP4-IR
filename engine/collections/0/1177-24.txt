Fashion photographer Rankin devoted a book entirely to her entitled Ten Times Rosie . Rankin opined that Huntington - Whiteley brought something different to modelling : `` We 've been looking at very , very skinny , almost masculine girls for a long time . ( Rosie ) really is the model of the moment . She 's the actress of the moment . She 's definitely going to become something much , much bigger . '' Celebrity make - up artist Ruby Hammer , who has worked with Huntington - Whiteley for years , described her as the `` quintessential '' English rose .
