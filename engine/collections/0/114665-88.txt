Mikayla ( Selena Gomez ) is a pop star who is very similar to Hannah , but is so far much less successful due to Hannah being in the industry for longer . Hannah first meets Mikayla on Colin Lassiter 's television show where , on air , the two girls share kind and supportive words . After cutting to commercials , Mikayla bluntly informs Hannah that she despises her , starting a rivalry between the girls . Hannah and Mikayla appear together with Lassiter a second time for a telethon fundraiser where they trade insults . However , to the public , the girls pretend to be friends . Mikaylas first top 10 hit is `` If Cupid Had a Heart '' . Like Hannah Montana , Mikayla 's career also includes acting . Her film debut is Roger Bucks : Intergalactic Bounty Hunter in which she stars as `` Alien Babe '' alongside Jake Ryan . Though her character may appear arrogant and shallow based on her behavior towards Hannah , Mikayla actually has been shown to have a much softer side towards others . Mikayla appears in `` I Want You to Want Me ... to Go to Florida , '' `` That 's What Friends Are For ? , '' and `` ( We 're So Sorry ) Uncle Earl . '' Mikayla 's music is panned by critic Barney Bittman ( Gilbert Gottfried ) who calls her a `` teen poop sensation , '' and says `` If Mikayla had a heart , she 'd stop singing ! '' Though Mikayla hates Hannah , she really likes Miley ( not knowing they are the same person ) and considers Miley her friend though she does n't like Lilly .
