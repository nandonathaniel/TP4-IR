Since 1970 , after he narrowly won a three - way election , Chile was ruled by President Salvador Allende , the first democratically elected Marxist to become president of a Latin American country through open elections . The United States government actively attempted to destabilize the Allende government , with U.S. President Richard Nixon ordering extensive use of economic warfare for this purpose . The Nixon administration also used the Central Intelligence Agency ( CIA ) to mount a major destabilization campaign . As the CIA revealed in 2000 , `` In the 1960s and the early 1970s , as part of the US Government policy to try to influence events in Chile , the CIA undertook specific covert action projects in Chile ... to discredit Marxist - leaning political leaders , especially Dr. Salvador Allende , and to strengthen and encourage their civilian and military opponents to prevent them from assuming power . '' The CIA worked with right - wing Chilean politicians , military personnel , and journalists to undermine socialism in Chile .
