In Ontario , Canada , one attempt to define the boom came from David Foot , author of Boom , Bust and Echo : Profiting from the Demographic Shift in the 21st century ( 1997 ) . He defines a Canadian boomer as someone born from 1947 to 1966 , the years that more than 400,000 babies were born . However , he acknowledges that is a demographic definition , and that culturally it may not be as clear - cut .
