In the American cartoon RWBY , the Seven Dwarfs are represented by Klein Sieben ( translated as `` Little Seven '' ) . Seiben , voiced by J. Michael Tatum , possesses the ability to alter his eye color and personality at will ; each personality resembles the personality of one of the Seven Dwarfs . Seiben serves as the butler of a large estate belonging to Jacques Schnee , CEO of the Schnee Dust Company in the kingdom of Atlas . Seiben 's loyalty , however , lies with Jacques 's daughter Weiss , whose likeness is based on Snow White herself .
