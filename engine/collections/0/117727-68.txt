During the four years the Rockets were in San Diego , they played their games in the San Diego Sports Arena , which had a seating capacity of 14,400 . In their first season after moving to Houston , the Rockets did not have their own arena , and they played their first two years at various venues in the city , including the Astrodome , AstroHall , Sam Houston Coliseum and Hofheinz Pavilion , the latter eventually being adopted as their home arena until 1975 . They also had to play `` home '' games in other cities such as San Antonio , Waco , Albuquerque , and even San Diego in efforts to extend the fan - base . During their first season , the Rockets averaged less than 5,000 fans per game ( roughly half full ) , and in one game in Waco , there were only 759 fans in attendance .
