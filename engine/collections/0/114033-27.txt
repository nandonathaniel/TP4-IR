The attack on Fort Sumter by South Carolina militia marked the beginning of hostilities . Both sides recruited large numbers of men into a new Volunteer Army , recruited and formed by the states . Regiments were recruited locally , with company officers elected by the men . Although many officers in the regular army accepted commissions in the new volunteer units outsiders were not usually welcome as officers , unless they were surgeons whose value was obvious . Colonels -- often local politicians who helped raise the troops -- were appointed by the governors , and generals were appointed by President Abraham Lincoln .
