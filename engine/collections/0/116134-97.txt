Because the islands of Hawaii are distant from other land habitats , life is thought to have arrived there by wind , waves ( i.e. by ocean currents ) and wings ( i.e. birds , insects , and any seeds they may have carried on their feathers ) . This isolation , in combination with the diverse environment ( including extreme altitudes , tropical climates , and arid shorelines ) , produced an array of endemic flora and fauna . Hawaii has more endangered species and has lost a higher percentage of its endemic species than any other U.S. state . One endemic plant , Brighamia , now requires hand - pollination because its natural pollinator is presumed to be extinct . The two species of Brighamia -- B. rockii and B. insignis -- are represented in the wild by around 120 individual plants . To ensure these plants set seed , biologists rappel down 3,000 - foot ( 910 m ) cliffs to brush pollen onto their stigmas .
