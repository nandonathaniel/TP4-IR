Although popular culture often uses jealousy and envy as synonyms , modern philosophers and psychologists have argued for conceptual distinctions between jealousy and envy . For example , philosopher John Rawls distinguishes between jealousy and envy on the ground that jealousy involves the wish to keep what one has , and envy the wish to get what one does not have . Thus , a child is jealous of her parents ' attention to a sibling , but envious of her friend 's new bicycle . Psychologists Laura Guerrero and Peter Andersen have proposed the same distinction . They claim the jealous person `` perceives that he or she possesses a valued relationship , but is in danger of losing it or at least of having it altered in an undesirable manner , '' whereas the envious person `` does not possess a valued commodity , but wishes to possess it . '' Gerrod Parrott draws attention to the distinct thoughts and feelings that occur in jealousy and envy .
