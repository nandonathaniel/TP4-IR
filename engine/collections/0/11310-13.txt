Soils represent a short to long - term carbon storage medium , and contain more carbon than all terrestrial vegetation and the atmosphere combined . Plant litter and other biomass including charcoal accumulates as organic matter in soils , and is degraded by chemical weathering and biological degradation . More recalcitrant organic carbon polymers such as cellulose , hemi - cellulose , lignin , aliphatic compounds , waxes and terpenoids are collectively retained as humus . Organic matter tends to accumulate in litter and soils of colder regions such as the boreal forests of North America and the Taiga of Russia . Leaf litter and humus are rapidly oxidized and poorly retained in sub-tropical and tropical climate conditions due to high temperatures and extensive leaching by rainfall . Areas where shifting cultivation or slash and burn agriculture are practiced are generally only fertile for 2 -- 3 years before they are abandoned . These tropical jungles are similar to coral reefs in that they are highly efficient at conserving and circulating necessary nutrients , which explains their lushness in a nutrient desert . Much organic carbon retained in many agricultural areas worldwide has been severely depleted due to intensive farming practices ) ) .
