Under Askia Muhammad , the Empire saw increased centralization . He encouraged learning in Timbuktu by rewarding its professors with larger pensions as an incentive . He also established an order of precedence and protocol and was noted as a noble man who gave back generously to the poor . Under his policies , Muhammad brought much stability to Songhai and great attestations of this noted organization are still preserved in the works of Maghrebin writers such as Leo Africanus , among others .
