Timberlake 's wife , Jessica Biel and his son Silas , have uncredited vocals on a number of songs on the album . Biel appears on the album 's lead - single `` Filthy '' and `` Hers ( Interlude ) '' . When sequencing the album , Timberlake felt that `` Filthy '' was `` a palette - cleanser , then we wanted to take you into the forest , take you outside , so I felt like I needed a voice of consciousness '' . Timberlake wrote Biel 's parts for her , which were subsequently recorded on the Voicenotes iPhone application . Timberlake wanted her to sound like `` the ghost , a presence , but we 're following ( her ) '' . The `` Hers ( Interlude ) '' was recorded after Timberlake mixed the album 's eleventh song `` Flannel '' .
