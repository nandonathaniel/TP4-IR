According to an article by John Dodge , editor in chief of Design News , use of Six Sigma is inappropriate in a research environment . Dodge states `` excessive metrics , steps , measurements and Six Sigma 's intense focus on reducing variability water down the discovery process . Under Six Sigma , the free - wheeling nature of brainstorming and the serendipitous side of discovery is stifled . '' He concludes `` there 's general agreement that freedom in basic or pure research is preferable while Six Sigma works best in incremental innovation when there 's an expressed commercial goal . ''
