Augustine also tells us that in his time Christians regularly fasted on Wednesdays and Fridays throughout the year and not just in Lent ( 36.30 ) and that some Churches fasted as well on the Sabbath . By comparison , fasting on the Lord 's Day ( Sunday ) `` would be a cause of no small scandal to the Church '' ( 36.2 , cf. 36.10 , 29 ) . He notes , `` For in these questions on which the divine scripture has determined nothing certain , the custom of the people of God or the practices of our ancestors are to be taken as law '' ( 36.2 ) . He makes it clear that not fasting on the Lord 's Day was the standard practice for the Church in Rome , in Africa and in Millan . He also points out that fasting or abstaining on the Lord 's Day was a practice of the followers of the heresy of the Manichees ( 36.27 ) and Priscillianist ( 36.28 ) which the Church universally rejected .
