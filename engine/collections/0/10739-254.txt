Amerindian linguist Lyle Campbell also assigned different percentage values of probability and confidence for various proposals of macro-families and language relationships , depending on his views of the proposals ' strengths . For example , the Germanic language family would receive probability and confidence percentage values of + 100 % and 100 % , respectively . However , if Turkish and Quechua were compared , the probability value might be âˆ’ 95 % , while the confidence value might be 95 % . 0 % probability or confidence would mean complete uncertainty .
