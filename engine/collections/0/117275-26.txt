Among its 369 employees , the main jobs at CDC were originally entomology and engineering . In CDC 's initial years , more than six and a half million homes were sprayed , mostly with DDT . In 1946 , there were only seven medical officers on duty and an early organization chart was drawn , somewhat fancifully , in the shape of a mosquito . Under Joseph Walter Mountin , the CDC continued to advocate for public health issues and pushed to extend its responsibilities to many other communicable diseases .
