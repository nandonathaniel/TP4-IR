Both languages have influenced each other throughout the years . According to different sources , nearly 30 % of all English words have a French origin , and today many French expressions have entered the English language as well . The term Franglais , a portmanteau combining the French words `` fran√ßais '' and `` anglais '' , refers to the combination of French and English ( mostly in the UK ) or the use of English words and nouns of Anglo - Saxon roots in French ( in France ) .
