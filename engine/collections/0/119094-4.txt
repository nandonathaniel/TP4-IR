The list includes all the theatrical works generally accepted as composed by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart . In this context `` theatrical '' means performed on a stage , by vocalists singing in character , in accordance with stage directions . Some sources have adopted more specific criteria , leading them to exclude the early `` Sacred Singspiel '' Die Schuldigkeit des ersten Gebots , which they classify as an oratorio . However , as Osborne makes clear , the libretto contains stage directions which suggest that the work was acted , not merely sung , and it is formally described as a `` geistliches Singspiel '' ( sacred play with music ) , not as an oratorio . The Singspiel Der Stein der Weisen was written in collaboration with four other composers , so it is only partially credited to Mozart .
