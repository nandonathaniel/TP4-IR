As preparations were made for the US tour , the Beatles knew that their music would hardly be heard . Having originally used Vox AC30 amplifiers , they later acquired more powerful 100 - watt amplifiers , specially designed by Vox for them as they moved into larger venues in 1964 , but these were still inadequate . Struggling to compete with the volume of sound generated by screaming fans , the band had grown increasingly bored with the routine of performing live . Recognising that their shows were no longer about the music , they decided to make the August tour their last .
