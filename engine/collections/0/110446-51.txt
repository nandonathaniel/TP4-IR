From the state line with New Mexico ( at Anthony ) to State Highway 20 ( SH 20 ) in west El Paso , I - 10 is bordered by frontage roads South Desert for lanes along I - 10 East ( actually headed south ) and North Desert for lanes along I - 10 West ( headed north ) . The interstate then has no frontage roads for nine miles ( 14 km ) but regains them east of downtown and retains them to Clint . In this stretch , the frontage roads are Gateway East for the eastbound lanes and Gateway West for the westbound lanes . All four frontage roads are one - way streets . Gateway East and Gateway West are notable , in particular , for TxDOT 's liberal usage of the Texas U-turn at most underpasses of I - 10 on this stretch .
