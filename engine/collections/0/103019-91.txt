Enlightenment historiography began in the period itself , from what Enlightenment figures said about their work . A dominant element was the intellectual angle they took . D'Alembert's Preliminary Discourse of l'Encyclopédie provides a history of the Enlightenment which comprises a chronological list of developments in the realm of knowledge -- of which the Encyclopédie forms the pinnacle . In 1783 , Jewish philosopher Moses Mendelssohn referred to Enlightenment as a process by which man was educated in the use of reason . Immanuel Kant called Enlightenment `` man 's release from his self - incurred tutelage '' , tutelage being `` man 's inability to make use of his understanding without direction from another '' . `` For Kant , Enlightenment was mankind 's final coming of age , the emancipation of the human consciousness from an immature state of ignorance '' . The German scholar Ernst Cassirer called the Enlightenment `` a part and a special phase of that whole intellectual development through which modern philosophic thought gained its characteristic self - confidence and self - consciousness '' . According to historian Roy Porter , the liberation of the human mind from a dogmatic state of ignorance is the epitome of what the Age of Enlightenment was trying to capture .
