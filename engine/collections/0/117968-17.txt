The precursor of both the Nazca Plate and the Cocos Plate ( to its north ) was the Farallon Plate , which split in the late Oligocene , about 22.8 Mya , a date arrived at by interpreting magnetic anomalies . Subduction under the South American continent began about 140 Mya , although the formation of the high parts of the Central Andes and the Bolivian orocline did not occur until 45 Mya . It has been suggested that the mountains were forced up by the subduction of the older and heavier parts of the plate , which sank more quickly into the mantle .
