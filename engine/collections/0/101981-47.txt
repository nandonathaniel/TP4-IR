Ibn Battuta then sailed to a state called Kaylukari in the land of Tawalisi , where he met Urduja , a local princess . Urduja was a brave warrior , and her people are opponents of the Yuan dynasty . She was described as an `` idolater '' , but could write the phrase Bismillah in Islamic calligraphy . The locations of Kaylukari and Tawalisi are disputed . Kaylukari might referred to Po Klong Garai in Champa ( now southern Vietnam ) , and Urduja might be an aristocrat of Champa or the Tráº§n dynasty . Filipinos widely believe that Kaylukari was in present - day Pangasinan Province of the Philippines . In modern times , Urduja has been featured in Filipino textbooks and films as a national heroine . Numerous other locations have been proposed , ranging from Java to somewhere in Guangdong Province , China . However , Sir Henry Yule and William Henry Scott consider both Tawilisi and Urduja to be entirely fictitious . ( See Tawalisi for details . )
