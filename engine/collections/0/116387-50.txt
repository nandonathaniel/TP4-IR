After a six - day outer space adventure that leaves them on the verge of psychological collapse , Rick and Morty decide to spend some time at an alien spa . There , they use a machine that extracts a person 's negative personality traits . However , without Rick and Morty knowing , those traits are transposed into toxic physical counterparts , characterized by Rick 's arrogance and Morty 's self - loathing . On the other hand , the true Rick becomes more considerate , and Morty 's confidence soars , which allows him to start dating girls . Toxic Rick uses a moonlight tower to remake the whole Earth in his own image , but the true Rick reverts the situation by merging back with him . Morty avoids merging back with his toxic counterpart and goes on to live a life as a stock broker in New York City . Rick tracks him down with the help of Jessica , Morty 's classmate , and restores order by re-injecting the negative personality traits into him . Post-credit scene : A tour of the same moonlight tower releases Stacy , one of the girls Morty dated in the episode , who had been inadvertently trapped inside the toxin machine .
