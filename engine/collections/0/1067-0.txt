`` I 'm going to Disney World ! '' and `` I 'm going to Disneyland ! '' are advertising slogans used in a series of television commercials by The Walt Disney Company that began airing in 1987 . Used to promote the company 's theme park resorts in Florida and California , the commercials most often are broadcast following the Super Bowl and typically feature an NFL player ( usually the Super Bowl MVP ) shouting the phrase while celebrating the team 's victory immediately after the championship game . These commercials have also promoted champions from other sports , and winners of non-sport competitions such as American Idol .
