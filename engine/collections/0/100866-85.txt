The euphoria of securing the Ashes preceded Australia 's heaviest defeat . At The Oval , England amassed a world record of 7 / 903 and their opening batsman Len Hutton scored an individual world record , by making 364 . In an attempt to relieve the burden on his bowlers , Bradman took a rare turn at bowling . During his third over , he fractured his ankle and teammates carried him from the ground . With Bradman injured and Fingleton unable to bat because of a leg muscle strain , Australia were thrashed by an innings and 579 runs , which remains the largest margin in Test cricket history . Unfit to complete the tour , Bradman left the team in the hands of vice-captain Stan McCabe . At this point , Bradman felt that the burden of captaincy would prevent him from touring England again , although he did not make his doubts public .
