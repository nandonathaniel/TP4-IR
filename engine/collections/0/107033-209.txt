Colby and Tina both pleaded their case for a million dollars . Tina asked the jury not to vote for someone because they got their feelings hurt and that what she was going home to was worth more than a million dollars . Colby said he did n't think he beat Tina in strategy , but that he did everything pretty well . Rodger asked for an instance where they did not tell the truth , and if they felt they played the game as ethically as possible ( Tina said she lied about Amber getting voted off , and said by her definition , yes ; Colby said he lied about taking Amber and Jerri to the final 3 , and that he had a struggle with ethics ) ; Amber asked what three things got them to the final and what three things they would do with the money ( Colby said refusing to mentally check out , drinking water , and taking time out to enjoy , and that he would buy a Harley , buy a building for his father , and take care of his mother financially ; Tina said strategy , Colby , and heart / God , and that she would pay off a house , her best friend 's house , and set up a fund to draw out of once a year for a family in need ) ; Elisabeth spoke about being deserving , and asked if they had the power to give 5 jury members the million dollar prize , who are the two they would leave out ( Tina said Jerri and Rodger , Colby said Jerri and Keith ) ; Keith asked them to give an example when they used manipulation to get where they are ( Colby said manipulating Tina to vote off Mitchell to get their team stronger ; Tina said the same thing ) ; Alicia asked what one thing they were personally proud of and least proud of ( Tina said the role she has played here and every Tribal Council ; Colby said the fire - making challenge and realizing how little respect he 's shown the land and taking it for granted ) ; Nick said that if Mike had n't gone , neither of them would be sitting there , and asked if Mike had never had his accident , what two people would be in their place and why ( Colby said Nick because he had the mental game and Mike because he helped his tribe in every challenge ; Tina said she could n't answer the question because she did n't really get a chance to know them all that well , but by the way they described him there was no doubt that Mike would be one of the two ) ; Jerri spoke about making and breaking alliances and asked them to clear their conscience by bringing up moments of feeling regret or guilt ( Tina said going through Kel 's bag ; Colby said Rodger , Elisabeth , and Alicia 's vote - offs because they were shallow , but that he had no regrets ) .
