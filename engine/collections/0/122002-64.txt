Another musical tradition of Europe originating during the early Middle Ages was the liturgical drama . In its original form , it may represent a survival of Roman drama with Christian stories -- mainly the Gospel , the Passion , and the lives of the saints -- grafted on . Every part of Europe had some sort of tradition of musical or semi-musical drama in the Middle Ages , involving acting , speaking , singing and instrumental accompaniment in some combination . These dramas were probably performed by travelling actors and musicians . Many have been preserved sufficiently to allow modern reconstruction and performance ( for example the Play of Daniel , which has been recently recorded at least ten times ) .
