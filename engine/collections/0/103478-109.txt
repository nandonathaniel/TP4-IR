Agatha Christie is the world 's best - selling mystery writer , often referred to as the `` Queen of Crime '' , and considered a master of suspense , plotting , and characterisation . Some critics , however , regarded Christie 's plotting abilities as considerably greater than her literary ones . Novelist Raymond Chandler criticised her in his essay `` The Simple Art of Murder '' , and American literary critic Edmund Wilson was dismissive of Christie and the detective fiction genre generally in his New Yorker essay , `` Who Cares Who Killed Roger Ackroyd ?
