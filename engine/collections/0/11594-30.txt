Between Delaware and Maryland : The existing east -- west transpeninsular line from the Atlantic Ocean to the Chesapeake Bay , as far as its midpoint from the Atlantic . A 12 - mile ( radius ) circle ( 12 mi ( 19 km ) ) around the city of New Castle , Delaware . A `` tangent line '' connecting the midpoint of the transpeninsular line to the western side of the 12 - mile circle . A `` north line '' along the meridian ( line of longitude ) from the tangent point to the Maryland Pennsylvania border . Should any land within the 12 - mile circle fall west of the north line , it would remain part of Delaware . ( This was indeed the case , and this border is the `` arc line '' . )
