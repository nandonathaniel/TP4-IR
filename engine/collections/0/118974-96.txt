Chile 's congressional elections are governed by a binomial system that , for the most part , rewards the two largest representations equally , often regardless of their relative popular support . Parties are thus forced to form wide coalitions and , historically , the two largest coalitions ( Concertaci√≥n and Alianza ) split most of the seats . Only if the leading coalition ticket out - polls the second place coalition by a margin of more than 2 - to - 1 does the winning coalition gain both seats , which tends to lock the legislature in a roughly 50 - 50 split .
