More than 1,600 species of plants grow in the Colorado River watershed , ranging from the creosote bush , saguaro cactus , and Joshua trees of the Sonoran and Mojave Deserts to the forests of the Rocky Mountains and other uplands , composed mainly of ponderosa pine , subalpine fir , Douglas - fir and Engelmann spruce . Before logging in the 19th century , forests were abundant in high elevations as far south as the Mexico -- U.S. border , and runoff from these areas nourished abundant grassland communities in river valleys . Some arid regions of the watershed , such as the upper Green River valley in Wyoming , Canyonlands National Park in Utah and the San Pedro River valley in Arizona and Sonora , supported extensive reaches of grassland roamed by large mammals such as buffalo and antelope as late as the 1860s . Near Tucson , Arizona , `` where now there is only powder - dry desert , the grass once reached as high as the head of a man on horse back '' .
