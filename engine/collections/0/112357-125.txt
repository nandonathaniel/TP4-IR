Mary was succeeded by her half - sister , Elizabeth , who broke with the precedents of many of her predecessors , and refused to name an heir . Whilst previous monarchs ( including Henry VIII ) had specifically been granted authority to settle uncertain successions in their wills , the Treasons Act 1571 asserted that Parliament had the right to settle disputes , and made it treason to deny Parliamentary authority . Wary of threats from other possible heirs , Parliament further passed the Act of Association 1584 , which provided that any individual involved in attempts to murder the Sovereign would be disqualified from succeeding . ( The Act was repealed in 1863 . )
