In 2013 , the river was at its all - time low in the Nizamabad district of Telangana . This had hit the growth of fish , making the life of fishermen miserable. The water - level was so low that people could easily walk into the middle of the river . Shortage in rainfall and closure of the controversial Babli project gates in Maharashtra was thought to have affected the water flow in the river and water availability to the Sriram Sagar Project except during above 20 % excess monsoon ( i.e. one out of four years ) years .
