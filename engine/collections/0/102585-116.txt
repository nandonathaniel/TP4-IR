Australia 's switch to the metric system in the 1970s changed the country 's vocabulary of measurement from imperial towards metric measures . Since the switch to metric , heights of individuals are still commonly spoken of and understood in feet and inches amongst the older generation , despite being listed in centimetres on official documents such as driver 's licence .
