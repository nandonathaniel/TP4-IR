Ol ' Dirty Bastard 's career in Wu - Tang was marked by erratic behavior . At the 1998 Grammy Awards , he protested the Clan 's loss ( to Puff Daddy in Best Rap Album ) by interrupting Shawn Colvin 's acceptance speech for her Song of the Year award . In addition , ODB 's run - ins with the law were well publicized -- he was arrested several times for offenses including assault , shoplifting , wearing body armor after being convicted of a felony , and possession of cocaine , and he missed multiple court dates . In late 2000 , Ol ' Dirty Bastard unexpectedly escaped near the end of his rehab sentence , spending one month on the run as a fugitive before showing up on stage at the record release party for The W in New York City . He managed to escape the club but was later captured by police in Philadelphia and sent to New York to face charges of cocaine possession . In April 2001 , he was sentenced to two to four years in prison . Once released from prison , he signed a one million dollar contract with Roc - a-Fella Records .
