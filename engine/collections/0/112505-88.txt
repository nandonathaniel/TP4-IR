The Twelfth Amendment explicitly states the constitutional requirements as provided for the President also apply to being Vice President . It is unclear whether a two - term president could later serve as Vice President . Some argue that the Twenty - second Amendment and Twelfth Amendment both bar any two - term president from later serving as Vice President as well as from succeeding to the presidency from any point in the United States presidential line of succession . Others contend that the Twelfth Amendment concerns qualification for service , while the Twenty - second Amendment concerns qualifications for election , and thus a former two - term president is still eligible to serve as Vice President . The applicability of this distinction has not been tested , as no former president has ever sought the vice presidency , and thus the courts have never been required to make a judgment regarding the matter . Hillary Clinton said during her 2016 candidacy that she considered naming Bill Clinton as her Vice President , but was advised it would be unconstitutional .
