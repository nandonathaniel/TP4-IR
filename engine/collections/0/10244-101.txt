Rom√©o et Juliette by Berlioz is a `` symphonie dramatique '' , a large - scale work in three parts for mixed voices , chorus , and orchestra , which premiered in 1839 . Tchaikovsky 's Romeo and Juliet Fantasy - Overture ( 1869 , revised 1870 and 1880 ) is a 15 - minute symphonic poem , containing the famous melody known as the `` love theme '' . Tchaikovsky 's device of repeating the same musical theme at the ball , in the balcony scene , in Juliet 's bedroom and in the tomb has been used by subsequent directors : for example , Nino Rota 's love theme is used in a similar way in the 1968 film of the play , as is Des'ree 's Kissing You in the 1996 film . Other classical composers influenced by the play include Henry Hugh Pearson ( Romeo and Juliet , overture for orchestra , Op. 86 ) , Svendsen ( Romeo og Julie , 1876 ) , Delius ( A Village Romeo and Juliet , 1899 -- 1901 ) , Stenhammar ( Romeo och Julia , 1922 ) , and Kabalevsky ( Incidental Music to Romeo and Juliet , Op. 56 , 1956 ) .
