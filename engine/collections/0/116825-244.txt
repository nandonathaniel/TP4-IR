The presence of a large number of immigrants and refugees from the now dissolved Mandate of Palestine fueled the regional ambitions of King Abdullah I , who sought control over what had been the British Jerusalem and Samaria districts on the west bank of Jordan River . Towards this goal the king granted Jordanian citizenship to all Arab holders of the Palestinian Mandate identity documents in February 1949 , and outlawed the terms `` Palestinian '' and `` Transjordanian '' from official usage , changing the country 's name from the Emirate of Trans - Jordan to the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan . The area east of the river became known as `` al - Ḍiffah al - Sharqiyyal '' , or `` The East Bank '' . In April 1950 , with the formal annexation of the positions held by the Jordanian Army since 1948 , the area became known as `` al - Ḍiffah al - Gharbiyyal '' or `` The Western Bank '' . With the formal union of the East and West Banks in 1950 , the number of Palestinians in the kingdom rose by another 720,000 , of whom 440,000 were West Bank residents and 280,000 were refugees from other areas of the former Mandate then living on the West Bank . Palestinians became the majority in Jordan although most believed their return to what was now the state of Israel was imminent .
