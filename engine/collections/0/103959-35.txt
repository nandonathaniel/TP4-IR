Green Bay dominated most of the first half of Super Bowl XLV , jumping to a 21 -- 3 lead before Pittsburgh cut it down to 21 -- 10 just before halftime . Then after the teams exchanged touchdowns , the Steelers pulled within 28 -- 25 midway through the fourth quarter with wide receiver Mike Wallace 's 25 - yard touchdown reception from quarterback Ben Roethlisberger and a two - point conversion . But the Packers answered with Mason Crosby 's 23 - yard field goal with 2 : 07 remaining , and then prevented the Steelers from scoring on their final drive of the game . Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers was named Super Bowl MVP , completing 24 of 39 passes for 304 yards and three touchdowns .
