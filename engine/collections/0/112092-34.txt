On the head 's left side was placed a `` crested '' and masked helmet wrapped in cloths . With its panels of tinned bronze and assembled mounts , the decoration is directly comparable to that found on helmets from the Vendel and Valsg√§rde cemeteries of eastern Sweden . The Sutton Hoo helmet differs from the Swedish examples in having an iron skull of a single vaulted shell and has a full face mask , a solid neck guard and deep cheekpieces . These features have been used to suggest an English origin for the helmet 's basic structure ; the deep cheekpieces have parallels in the Coppergate helmet , found in York . Although outwardly very like the Swedish examples , the Sutton Hoo helmet is a product of better craftsmanship . Helmets are extremely rare finds . No other such figural plaques were known in England , apart from a fragment from a burial at Caenby , Lincolnshire , until the 2009 discovery of the Staffordshire hoard , which contained many . The helmet rusted in the grave and was shattered into hundreds of tiny fragments when the chamber roof collapsed . Restoration of the helmet thus involved the meticulous identification , grouping and orientation of the surviving fragments before it could be reconstructed .
