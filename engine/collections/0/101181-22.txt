Passenger traffic started on 10 October 1825 , after the required licence was purchased , using the Experiment coach hauled by a horse . The coach was initially timetabled to travel from Stockton to Darlington in two hours , with a fare of 1s , and made a return journey four days a week and a one - way journey on Tuesdays and Saturdays . In April 1826 the operation of the coach was contracted for £ 200 a year ; by then the timetabled journey time had been reduced to ​ 1 ⁄ hours and passengers were allowed to travel on the outside for 9d . A more comfortable coach , Express , started the same month and charged 1s 6d for travel inside . Innkeepers began running coaches , two to Shildon from July , and the Union , which served the Yarm branch from 16 October . There were no stations : in Darlington the coaches picked up passengers near the north road crossing , whereas in Stockton they picked up at different places on the quay . Between 30,000 and 40,000 passengers were carried between July 1826 and June 1827 .
