Due to issues regarding his legal status in the Royal Spanish Football Federation , Messi missed the start of La Liga , but on 26 September , he acquired Spanish citizenship and became eligible to play . Wearing the number 19 shirt , he gradually established himself as the first - choice right winger , forming an attacking trio with Ronaldinho and striker Samuel Eto'o . He was in the starting line - up in major matches like his first Cl√°sico against rivals Real Madrid on 19 November , as well as Barcelona 's away victory over Chelsea in the last 16 round of the Champions League , where he played his best match to that point . After he had scored 8 goals in 25 games , including his first in the Champions League , his season ended prematurely during the return leg against Chelsea on 7 March 2006 , when he suffered a torn hamstring . Messi worked to regain fitness in time for the Champions League final , but on 17 May , the day of the final , he was eventually ruled out . He was so disappointed that he did not celebrate his team 's victory over Arsenal in Paris , something he later came to regret .
