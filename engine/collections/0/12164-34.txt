Because jujutsu contains so many facets , it has become the foundation for a variety of styles and derivations today . As each instructor incorporated new techniques and tactics into what was taught to him originally , he could codify and create his own ryu ( school ) or Federation to help other instructors , schools , and clubs . Some of these schools modified the source material so much that they no longer considered themselves a style of jujutsu .
