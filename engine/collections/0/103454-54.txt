There are three levels of apprenticeship . The first level is the apprentice , i.e. , the `` çırak '' in Turkish . The second level is pre-master which is called , `` kalfa '' in Turkish . The mastery level is called as `` usta '' and is the highest level of achievement . An ' usta ' is eligible to take in and accept new ' ciraks ' to train and bring them up . The training process usually starts when the small boy is of age 10 - 11 and becomes a full grown master at the age of 20 - 25 . Many years of hard work and disciplining under the authority of the master is the key to the young apprentice 's education and learning process .
