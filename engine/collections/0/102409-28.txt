A key work on random walk was done in the late 1980s by Profs . Andrew Lo and Craig MacKinlay ; they effectively argue that a random walk does not exist , nor ever has . Their paper took almost two years to be accepted by academia and in 1999 they published `` A Non-random Walk Down Wall St . '' which collects their research papers on the topic up to that time .
