In the cultural sphere , there are many books , plays , and songs being written or produced in the Punjabi - language in Pakistan . Until the 1970s , there were a large number of Punjabi - language films being produced by the Lollywood film industry , however since then Urdu has become a much more dominant language in film production . Additionally , television channels in Punjab Province ( centred on the Lahore area ) are broadcast in Urdu . The preeminence of Urdu in both broadcasting and the Lollywood film industry is seen by critics as being detrimental to the health of the language .
