Unlike activating phosphorylation , CDK inhibitory phosphorylation is vital for regulation of the cell cycle . Various kinases and phosphatases regulate their phosphorylation state . One of the kinases that place the tyrosine phosphate is Wee1 , a kinase conserved in all eukaryotes . Fission yeast also contains a second kinase Mik1 that can phosphorylate the tyrosine . Vertebrates contain a different second kinase called Myt1 that is related to Wee1 but can phosphorylate both the threonine and the tyrosine . Phosphatases from the Cdc25 family dephosphorylate both the threonine and the tyrosine .
