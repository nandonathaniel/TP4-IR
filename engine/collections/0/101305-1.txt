The earliest known performance of the play is recorded in Philip Henslowe 's diary on 11 June 1594 , performed by the Lord Admiral 's Men and the Lord Chamberlain 's Men at Newington Butts Theatre ; `` begininge at newing ton my Lord Admeralle men & my Lorde chamberlen men as ffolowethe ( ... ) 11 of June 1594 Rd at the tamynge of A Shrowe . '' This could have been either A Shrew or The Shrew , but as the Lord Chamberlain 's Men were sharing the theatre at the time , and as such Shakespeare himself would have been there , scholars tend to assume it was The Shrew . The earliest definite performance of The Shrew was at court before Charles I and Henrietta Maria on 26 November 1633 , where it was described as being `` likt '' .
