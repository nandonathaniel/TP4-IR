By the late 2000s and early 2010s , South Africa began a great phase of high music experimentation of genres previously not very prominent in the country while maintaining its rooted music . The chart success of the 2010 FIFA World Cup song Waka Waka ( This Time for Africa ) , which featured South African band Freshlyground - resulted in one of the country 's first major chart topping hits by their own artist , launching a great amount of inspiration to other local instrumentalists . Following the success , Die Antwoord became one of the first acts of the country to obtain three albums that charted in the top 150 of the Billboard 200 , marking new highs for the country 's music industry . One of the band 's singles , `` Enter The Ninja , '' also obtained top 50 positions in the United Kingdom and Australia . Rapper AKA also received a high amount of recognition by 2013 , becoming famous for local chart topping hits , including `` Congratulate '' and `` All Eyes On Me . '' The country introduced its first official , internationally recognized music chart Mediaguide , later renamed Entertainment Monitoring Africa . The chart currently relies on airplay for its charting potions , as opposed to others that also count physical purchases , downloads , and streams .
