When the series first began , General Hospital was set in an unnamed city or town somewhere in the United States of America . Between 1964 and 1966 , Queen 's Point , the setting of the short - lived soap opera , The Young Marrieds , was considered to be a suburb of that same unnamed city , part of a plan to feature regular crossovers between the two shows which never materialized due to the cancellation of Marrieds . It was not until 1977 that the General Hospital setting was finally established as the fictional city of Port Charles , New York .
