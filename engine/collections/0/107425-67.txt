On July 12 , 2017 , Muschietti , in an interview with French magazine Mad Movies , spoke of the R rating allowing him to go into adult themes , which was championed from the people at New Line Cinema . He also stated that , `` ... if you aimed for a PG - 13 movie , you had nothing at the end . So we were very lucky that the producers did n't try to stop us . In fact it 's more our own moral compass that sometimes showed us that some things lead us in places where we did n't want to go . '' In the same interview , on July 12 , 2017 , producer Barbara Muschietti added that there was only one scene that was deemed to be too horrific to feature in the new adaptation , stating , `` ... you wo n't find the scene where a kid has his back broken and is thrown in the toilets . We thought that the visual translation of that scene had something that was really too much . '' Muschietti concluded by emphasizing that nothing was removed from the original vision , nor was the violence of any event watered down .
