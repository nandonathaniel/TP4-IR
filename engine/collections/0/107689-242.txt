ESPN Radio broadcast the 2010 World Series nationally , with Jon Miller ( who worked the San Francisco Giants ' local radio broadcasts during the regular season ) calling his 13th consecutive World Series as the network 's play - by - play announcer , and Joe Morgan providing commentary on his 11th World Series for ESPN Radio and his 14th overall ( counting three Series telecasts for NBC ) . The games were the last that Miller and Morgan ( who had also been calling Sunday Night Baseball for ESPN television since 1990 ) would work together , as the network subsequently announced that their contracts would not be renewed for 2011 . ESPN Deportes Radio also aired the Series to Spanish language listeners , with Eduardo Ortega and former Giants pitcher Juan Marichal announcing . In the UK , the Series was broadcast by BBC Radio Five Live Sports Extra , with Jonny Gould and Josh Chetwynd commentating . Locally , the two teams ' flagship stations broadcast the series with their respective announcing crews , with an additional requirement of acknowledging AutoZone , ESPN Radio 's baseball broadcasting sponsor . The Giants ' English - language broadcasts aired on KNBR - AM ( with Dave Flemming , Duane Kuiper , and Mike Krukow announcing ) with their Spanish - language broadcasts on KIQI - AM ( with Erwin Higueros and Tito Fuentes ) , while KRLD - FM and AM carried the Rangers ' English - language broadcasts ( with Eric Nadel and Dave Barnett ) and KFLC - AM had their Spanish - language broadcasts ( with Eleno Ornelas and Jerry Romo ) . Due to contractual obligations , the non-flagship stations on the teams ' radio networks carried the ESPN Radio broadcasts of the games , although the local broadcasts were also available on XM Satellite Radio and to Gameday Audio subscribers at MLB.com .
