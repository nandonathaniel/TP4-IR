Several critics called it a highlight of This Is What the Truth Feels Like . According to Pitchfork 's Jillian Mapes , `` Make Me Like You '' was the album 's `` only ... song that really works '' . Carolyn Menyes of Music Times said that of the two songs which `` capture ... the earliest stage ( s ) of a relationship '' ( the other was `` Send Me a Picture '' ) , `` Make Me Like You '' was `` more exciting '' . Ryan Middleton , also from Music Times , wrote that its `` solid production '' gave him a `` temporary earworm '' . Exclaim ! 's Gregory Adams praised Stefani 's `` signature pipes '' in the chorus , and Amanda Dykan of AltWire wrote that the singer had never really been away . Although Adam R. Holz of Plugged In appreciated the song 's `` honest lyrics '' , Lindsay Zoladz of Vulture found them `` irrepressibly '' and `` convincingly teenage '' . In The Michigan Daily , Christian Kennedy called them `` catchy without leaning towards the tepidity of much of today 's pop music '' and they suited the song 's `` well - oiled production '' . Mesfin Fekadu , a critic for The National , wrote that the single `` do ( es ) n't feel connected to Stefani -- it 's as if another pop star could sing the track and you would n't notice the difference '' ; Fekadu found the song `` disappointing for a singer who is usually a standout on the pop music scene '' .
