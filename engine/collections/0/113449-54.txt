Terrestrial mammals other than bats known to echolocate include two genera ( Sorex and Blarina ) of shrews and the tenrecs of Madagascar . These include the wandering shrew ( Sorex vagrans ) , the common or Eurasian shrew ( Sorex araneus ) , and the short - tailed shrew ( Blarina brevicauda ) . The nature of shrew sounds unlike those of bats are low amplitude , broadband , multi-harmonic and frequency modulated . They contain no ' echolocation clicks ' with reverberations and would seem to be used for simple , close range spatial orientation . In contrast to bats , shrews use echolocation only to investigate their habitat rather than additionally to pinpoint food .
