Breck witnesses an ape auction one day , and on a whim bids on a young chimpanzee ( through his assistant Mr. MacDonald ) . His bid wins , and he shows the chimp how to choose a name from a book . The name he chooses is `` Caesar '' , pretending to just point randomly . While he is bright , and everyone suspects he was previously `` conditioned '' and not a wild ape , he makes a mistake in the chore given him ( mixing a cocktail for the governor ) . Breck decides to assign Caesar to his command post , as a messenger .
