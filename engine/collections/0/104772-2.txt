For the dry method , the column is first filled with dry stationary phase powder , followed by the addition of mobile phase , which is flushed through the column until it is completely wet , and from this point is never allowed to run dry . For the wet method , a slurry is prepared of the eluent with the stationary phase powder and then carefully poured into the column . Care must be taken to avoid air bubbles . A solution of the organic material is pipetted on top of the stationary phase . This layer is usually topped with a small layer of sand or with cotton or glass wool to protect the shape of the organic layer from the velocity of newly added eluent . Eluent is slowly passed through the column to advance the organic material . Often a spherical eluent reservoir or an eluent - filled and stoppered separating funnel is put on top of the column .
