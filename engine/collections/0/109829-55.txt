By 1919 , Shahan and McKenna chose architectural drawings by the Boston firm of Maginnis & Walsh for construction of the national shrine . Initially , they considered a traditional Neo-Gothic architectural style , but Shahan opted instead for a Byzantine Revival - Romanesque Revival design . Cardinal James Gibbons , archbishop of Baltimore , blessed the foundation stone on September 23 , 1920 . More than 10,000 people attended the Mass , including ambassadors , government officials , and military officers . In 1929 , the Great Depression halted the construction above the crypt level . The beginning of American involvement in World War II stalled plans even further .
