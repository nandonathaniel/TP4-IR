In September 2017 current president Maithripala Sirisena refused to let several human rights groups take Jagath Jayasuriya to court for war crimes . He reportedly said `` I stated very clearly that I will not allow anyone in the world to touch Jagath Jayasuriya or any other military chief or any war hero in this country , '' in reference to the lawsuit . His comments are seen as an attempt to pander to the majority ethnic Sinhalese , most of whom oppose legal action against military personnel accused of crimes during the civil war .
