Westminster Abbey , founded in AD 960 , has a particular status and is known as a Royal Peculiar . Although the abbey has been the traditional location for coronations since 1066 , not until the 20th century did it become the church of choice for royal weddings ; prior to 1918 , most royal weddings took place in the royal chapels , such as the Chapel Royal at St James 's Palace and St George 's Chapel , Windsor Castle . The abbey , which has a usual seating capacity of 2000 , has been the venue for most royal weddings in the last century , including those of William 's grandparents ( the present Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip ) in 1947 , William 's grandaunt Princess Margaret in 1960 , William 's aunt Princess Anne in 1973 , and William 's uncle Prince Andrew in 1986 . A prominent decorative addition inside the abbey for the ceremony was an avenue of 20 - foot tall trees , six field maple and two hornbeams , arranged on either side of the main aisle .
