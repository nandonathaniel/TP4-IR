On 4 April 2011 , former Real Madrid manager Carlos Queiroz agreed to a two - and - a-half - year deal to coach the Iranian national team until the end of the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil . Under Queiroz , Iran began their World Cup qualification campaign successfully , defeating the Maldives 4 -- 0 in the first leg of their second round of qualifiers . After winning 5 -- 0 on aggregate , Iran advanced to the third round of qualifiers , where they were drawn with Indonesia , Qatar and Bahrain . Iran highlighted their position at the top of their group by defeating Bahrain 6 -- 0 at home in the Azadi Stadium , as well as inviting former German youth international , Ashkan Dejagah , who scored twice on his debut against Qatar . After a 4 -- 1 win at Indonesia , Iran qualified for the final round of direct qualifiers , the fourth round . In the fourth round , Iran was drawn with South Korea , Qatar , Uzbekistan , and Lebanon in their group . Queiroz made new foreign - based additions to his squad , adding players such as Reza Ghoochannejhad to his team . Iran started their fourth round of Asian qualifiers with a 1 -- 0 win in Uzbekistan . Team Melli then drew Qatar and lost in Lebanon before defeating South Korea at the Azadi on 16 October with a goal from captain Javad Nekounam . After a 1 -- 0 loss in Tehran against Uzbekistan , Iran defeated Qatar 1 -- 0 in Doha and Lebanon 4 -- 0 at home . In their last qualification match , Iran defeated South Korea 1 -- 0 in Ulsan Munsu with a goal from Ghoochannejhad , resulting in their qualification to the 2014 FIFA World Cup as group winners with 16 points . Thus , Iran became the third team that Queiroz has managed to qualify for the World Cup , having reached the 2002 edition with South Africa and the 2010 edition with Portugal , leading the latter to a knockout stage finish . Iran continued their winning streak , securing qualification to the 2015 Asian Cup months later as well .
