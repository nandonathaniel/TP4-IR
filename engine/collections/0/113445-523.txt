Marsaglia ( 2004 ) suggested a simple algorithm based on the Taylor series expansion Φ ( x ) = 1 2 + φ ( x ) ( x + x 3 3 + x 5 3 ⋅ 5 + x 7 3 ⋅ 5 ⋅ 7 + x 9 3 ⋅ 5 ⋅ 7 ⋅ 9 + ⋯ ) ( \ displaystyle \ Phi ( x ) = ( \ frac ( 1 ) ( 2 ) ) + \ varphi ( x ) \ left ( x+ ( \ frac ( x ^ ( 3 ) ) ( 3 ) ) + ( \ frac ( x ^ ( 5 ) ) ( 3 \ cdot 5 ) ) + ( \ frac ( x ^ ( 7 ) ) ( 3 \ cdot 5 \ cdot 7 ) ) + ( \ frac ( x ^ ( 9 ) ) ( 3 \ cdot 5 \ cdot 7 \ cdot 9 ) ) + \ cdots \ right ) ) for calculating Φ ( x ) with arbitrary precision . The drawback of this algorithm is comparatively slow calculation time ( for example it takes over 300 iterations to calculate the function with 16 digits of precision when x = 10 ) .
