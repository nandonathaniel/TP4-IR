Von Braun and his team were sent to the United States Army 's White Sands Proving Ground , located in New Mexico , in 1945 . They set about assembling the captured V2s and began a program of launching them and instructing American engineers in their operation . These tests led to the first rocket to take photos from outer space , and the first two - stage rocket , the WAC Corporal - V2 combination , in 1949 . The German rocket team was moved from Fort Bliss to the Army 's new Redstone Arsenal , located in Huntsville , Alabama , in 1950 . From here , von Braun and his team developed the Army 's first operational medium - range ballistic missile , the Redstone rocket , that in slightly modified versions , launched both America 's first satellite , and the first piloted Mercury space missions . It became the basis for both the Jupiter and Saturn family of rockets .
