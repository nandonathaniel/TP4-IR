In his 1868 book on Variation under Domestication , Charles Darwin assessed the arguments for single or multiple origins of dogs , and noted the paleontological research of de Blainville who proposed that dogs were descended from a single extinct species . In 1934 , an eminent paleontologist indicated that the ancestor of the dog lineage may have been the extinct Canis lupus variabilis . In 1950 , a morphological study of Japanese prehistoric dogs compared to extant wolves concluded : `` Therefore the living wolf kinds have nothing to do with the ancestral forms of the prehistoric dog races . '' In 1999 , a study emphasized that while molecular genetic data seem to support the origin of dogs from wolves , dogs may have descended from a now extinct species of canid whose closest living relative was the wolf . The dog 's lineage may have been contributed to from a ghost population . The advent of rapid and inexpensive DNA sequencing technology has made it possible to significantly increase the resolving power of genetic data taken from both modern and ancient domestic dog genomes . Attention was now turned to studies based on ancient DNA from fossil canids .
