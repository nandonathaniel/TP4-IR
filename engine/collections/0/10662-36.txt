William Ruddiman has proposed the early anthropocene hypothesis , according to which the anthropocene era , as some people call the most recent period in the earth 's history when the activities of the human species first began to have a significant global impact on the earth 's climate and ecosystems , did not begin in the 18th century with the advent of the Industrial Era , but dates back to 8,000 years ago , due to intense farming activities of our early agrarian ancestors . It was at that time that atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations stopped following the periodic pattern of the Milankovitch cycles . In his overdue - glaciation hypothesis Ruddiman states that an incipient glacial would probably have begun several thousand years ago , but the arrival of that scheduled glacial was forestalled by the activities of early farmers .
