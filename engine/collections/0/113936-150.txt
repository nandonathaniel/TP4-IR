By 1960 , the combination of World War II and the massive emigration westward left East Germany with only 61 % of its population of working age , compared to 70.5 % before the war . The loss was disproportionately heavy among professionals : engineers , technicians , physicians , teachers , lawyers and skilled workers . The direct cost of manpower losses to East Germany ( and corresponding gain to the West ) has been estimated at $7 billion to $9 billion , with East German party leader Walter Ulbricht later claiming that West Germany owed him $17 billion in compensation , including reparations as well as manpower losses . In addition , the drain of East Germany 's young population potentially cost it over 22.5 billion marks in lost educational investment . The brain drain of professionals had become so damaging to the political credibility and economic viability of East Germany that the re-securing of the German communist frontier was imperative .
