ILOVEYOU , sometimes referred to as Love Bug or Love Letter , was a computer worm that attacked tens of millions of Windows personal computers on and after 5 May 2000 local time in the Philippines when it started spreading as an email message with the subject line `` ILOVEYOU '' and the attachment `` LOVE - LETTER - FOR - YOU. txt. vbs '' . The latter file extension ( ' vbs ' , a type of interpreted file ) was most often hidden by default on Windows computers of the time ( as it is an extension for a file type that is known by Windows ) , leading unwitting users to think it was a normal text file . Opening the attachment activated the Visual Basic script . The worm did damage on the local machine , overwriting random types of files ( including Office files , image files , and audio files ; however after overwriting MP3 files the virus would hide the file ) , and sent a copy of itself to all addresses in the Windows Address Book used by Microsoft Outlook . In contrast , the Melissa virus only sent copies to the first 50 contacts . This made it spread much faster than any other previous email worm .
