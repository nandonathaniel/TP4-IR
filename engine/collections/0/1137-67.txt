Lindsey Fraser , who had supplied one of the blurb comments , wrote what is thought to be the first published review , in The Scotsman on 28 June 1997 . She described Harry Potter and the Philosopher 's Stone as `` a hugely entertaining thriller '' and Rowling as `` a first - rate writer for children '' . Another early review , in The Herald , said , `` I have yet to find a child who can put it down . '' Newspapers outside Scotland started to notice the book , with glowing reviews in The Guardian , The Sunday Times and The Mail on Sunday , and in September 1997 Books for Keeps , a magazine that specialised in children 's books , gave the novel four stars out of five . The Mail on Sunday rated it as `` the most imaginative debut since Roald Dahl '' ; a view echoed by the Sunday Times ( `` comparisons to Dahl are , this time , justified '' ) , while The Guardian called it `` a richly textured novel given lift - off by an inventive wit '' and The Scotsman said it had `` all the makings of a classic '' .
