Public support in the United States for civil service reform strengthened following the assassination of President James Garfield . The United States Civil Service Commission was created by the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act , which was passed into law on January 16 , 1883 . The commission was created to administer the civil service of the United States federal government . The law required federal government employees to be selected through competitive exams and basis of merit ; it also prevented elected officials and political appointees from firing civil servants , removing civil servants from the influences of political patronage and partisan behavior . However , the law did not apply to state and municipal governments .
