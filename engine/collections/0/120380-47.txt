The 1953 Ionian islands earthquake occurred with a surface wave magnitude of 7.2 and a maximum Mercalli intensity of X ( Extreme ) on August 12 , 1953 . Building damage was extensive and the southern islands of Kefalonia and Zakynthos were practically levelled . The islands were reconstructed from the ground up over the following years under a strict building code . The code has proven extremely effective , as many earthquakes since that time have caused no damage to new buildings .
