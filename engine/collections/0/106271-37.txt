This proclamation rendered worthless all land grants given by the government to British subjects who fought for the Crown against France . People throughout the various colonies were filled with indignation at having been unjustly shut out of the vast western wilderness and away from its resources . This anger was a foreshadowing of the discontent that would later arise during the American Revolution . The Royal Proclamation continues to be of legal importance to First Nations in Canada . The 1763 proclamation line is similar to the Eastern Continental Divide 's path running northwards from Georgia to the Pennsylvania -- New York border and north - eastwards past the drainage divide on the St. Lawrence Divide from there northwards through New England .
