During the Seven Years ' War ( in the United States , known as the French and Indian War ) , British forces seized Canada from the French , but the francophone population remained politically isolated from the southern colonies . Excluding the Native Americans , who were being conquered and displaced , the 13 British colonies had a population of over 2.1 million in 1770 , about one - third that of Britain . Despite continuing new arrivals , the rate of natural increase was such that by the 1770s only a small minority of Americans had been born overseas . The colonies ' distance from Britain had allowed the development of self - government , but their success motivated monarchs to periodically seek to reassert royal authority .
