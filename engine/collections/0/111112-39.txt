Arsenal 's home colours have been the inspiration for at least three other clubs . In 1909 , Sparta Prague adopted a dark red kit like the one Arsenal wore at the time ; in 1938 , Hibernian adopted the design of the Arsenal shirt sleeves in their own green and white strip . In 1920 , Sporting Clube de Braga 's manager returned from a game at Highbury and changed his team 's green kit to a duplicate of Arsenal 's red with white sleeves and shorts , giving rise to the team 's nickname of Os Arsenalistas . These teams still wear those designs to this day .
