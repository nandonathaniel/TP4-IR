In the early 1760s Peter Forsskål systematically cataloged plants and fishes in the Red Sea area . For genera and species that did not already have Latin names , Forsskål used the common Arabic names as the scientific names . This became the international standard for most of what he cataloged . Forsskål 's Latinized Arabic plant genus names include Aerva , Arnebia , Cadaba , Ceruana , Maerua , Maesa , Themeda , and others .
