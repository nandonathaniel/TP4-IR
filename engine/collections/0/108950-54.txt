The country 's dual name results from its complex administrative history before independence . The word papua is derived from an old local term of uncertain origin . `` New Guinea '' ( Nueva Guinea ) was the name coined by the Spanish explorer Yñigo Ortiz de Retez . In 1545 , he noted the resemblance of the people to those he had earlier seen along the Guinea coast of Africa . Guinea , in its turn , is etymologically derived from Portuguese word Guiné . The name is one of several toponyms sharing similar etymologies , ultimately meaning `` land of the blacks '' or similar meanings , in reference to the dark skin of the inhabitants .
