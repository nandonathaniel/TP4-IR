The existence of a neutral atmosphere implies that an ionosphere should exist , because oxygen molecules are ionized by the impacts of the energetic electrons coming from the magnetosphere and by solar EUV radiation . However , the nature of the Ganymedian ionosphere is as controversial as the nature of the atmosphere . Some Galileo measurements found an elevated electron density near Ganymede , suggesting an ionosphere , whereas others failed to detect anything . The electron density near the surface is estimated by different sources to lie in the range 400 -- 2,500 cm . As of 2008 , the parameters of the ionosphere of Ganymede are not well constrained .
