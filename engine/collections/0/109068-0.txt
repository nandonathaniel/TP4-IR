Working time in the United Kingdom is regulated in UK labour law in respect of holidays , daily breaks , night work and the maximum working day under the Working Time Regulations 1998 . While the traditional mechanisms for ensuring a `` fair day 's wage for a fair day 's work '' is by collective agreement , since 1962 the UK created minimum statutory rights for every individual at work . The WTR 1998 follow the requirements of the Working Time Directive , which allowed an `` opt out '' from the maximum working week , set at 48 hours . Other reforms have included the 28 holiday minimum per year , 20 minute breaks for each six hours worked , and a maximum of 8 hours work on any given night .
