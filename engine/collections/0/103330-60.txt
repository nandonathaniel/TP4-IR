Another conjecture suggests that the word Malta comes from the Phoenician word Maleth , `` a haven '' , or ' port ' in reference to Malta 's many bays and coves . Few other etymological mentions appear in classical literature , with the term Malta appearing in its present form in the Antonine Itinerary ( Itin . Marit . p. 518 ; Sil . Ital . xiv. 251 ) .
