Sam Walton believed that the company 's contribution to society was the fact that it operated efficiently , thereby lowering the cost of living for customers , and , therefore , in that sense was a `` powerful force for good '' , despite his refusal to contribute cash to philanthropic causes . Having begun to feel that his wealth attracted people who wanted nothing more than a `` handout '' , he explained that while he believed his family had been fortunate and wished to use his wealth to aid worthy causes like education , they could not be expected to `` solve every personal problem that comes to ( their ) attention '' . He explained later in his autobiography , `` We feel very strongly that Wal - Mart really is not , and should not be , in the charity business , '' stating `` any debit has to be passed along to somebody -- either shareholders or our customers . '' Since Sam Walton 's death in 1992 , however , Walmart and the Walmart Foundation dramatically increased charitable giving . For example , in 2005 , Walmart donated US $20 million in cash and merchandise for Hurricane Katrina relief . Today , Walmart 's charitable donations approach US $1 billion each year .
