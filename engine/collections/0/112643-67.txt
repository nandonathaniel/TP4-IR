Many , many thanks for your Christmas gift -- the capture of Savannah . When you were leaving Atlanta for the Atlantic coast , I was anxious , if not fearful ; but feeling that you were the better judge , and remembering that ' nothing risked , nothing gained ' I did not interfere . Now , the undertaking being a success , the honor is all yours ; for I believe none of us went farther than to acquiesce . And taking the work of Gen. Thomas into the count , as it should be taken , it is indeed a great success . Not only does it afford the obvious and immediate military advantage ; but , in showing to the world that your army could be divided , putting the stronger part to an important new service , and yet leaving enough to vanquish the old opposing force of the whole -- Hood 's army -- it brings those who sat in darkness , to see a great light . But what next ? I suppose it will be safer if I leave Gen. Grant and yourself to decide . Please make my grateful acknowledgements to your whole army , officers and men .
