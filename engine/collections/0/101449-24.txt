In 1970 , to capitalize on the Miracles ' success there , and due to a lack of new material from the group , Motown Britain selected `` The Tears of a Clown '' from the group 's catalog for single release . A new mix of the song was made in February 1970 for the US single release ( the original UK single used the original 1967 stereo mix from the Make It Happen LP ) , and `` The Tears of a Clown '' became a # 1 hit in the UK seven weeks after its July release .
