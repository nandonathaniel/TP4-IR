Original scriptures of the Ājīvika school of philosophy may once have existed , but these are currently unavailable and probably lost . Their theories are extracted from mentions of Ajivikas in the secondary sources of ancient Indian literature , particularly those of Jainism and Buddhism which polemically criticized the Ajivikas . The Ājīvika school is known for its Niyati doctrine of absolute determinism ( fate ) , the premise that there is no free will , that everything that has happened , is happening and will happen is entirely preordained and a function of cosmic principles . Ājīvika considered the karma doctrine as a fallacy . Ājīvikas were atheists and rejected the authority of the Vedas , but they believed that in every living being is an ātman -- a central premise of Hinduism and Jainism .
