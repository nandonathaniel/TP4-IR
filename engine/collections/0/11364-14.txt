On October 24 , 1901 , her 63rd birthday , the barrel was put over the side of a rowboat , and Taylor climbed in , along with her lucky heart - shaped pillow . After screwing down the lid , friends used a bicycle tire pump to compress the air in the barrel . The hole used for this was plugged with a cork , and Taylor was set adrift near the American shore , south of Goat Island .
