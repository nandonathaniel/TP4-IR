A demonstration of the height - success association can be found in the realm of politics . In the United States presidential elections , the taller candidate won 22 out of 25 times in the 20th century . Nevertheless , Ignatius Loyola , founder of the Jesuits , was 150 cm ( 4 ft 11 in ) and several prominent world leaders of the 20th century , such as Vladimir Lenin , Benito Mussolini , Nicolae Ceau»ôescu and Joseph Stalin were of below average height . These examples , however , were all before modern forms of multi-media , i.e. , television , which may further height discrimination in modern society . Further , growing evidence suggests that height may be a proxy for confidence , which is likewise strongly correlated with occupational success .
