Neil McCormick of The Daily Telegraph , in an article on One Direction 's success in North America , notes that Americans had left a gap in the market and it took the prominence of Justin Bieber to demonstrate that there still was a market for `` clean cut , wholesome , whiter - than - white , middle class parent friendly pop : cute boys advocating puppy love . And what could be better than one cute boy , if not five ? '' One Direction have been described as sparking a resurgence in the interest in boy bands , and as forming part of a new `` British Invasion '' in the United States . Bill Werde , a representative of Billboard magazine , commented , `` There 's a lot of possibility here , there 's a lot of upside , that level of talent with those kinds of looks , it 's really a perfect storm for a massive , massive successful phenomenon .
