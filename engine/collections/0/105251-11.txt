Jerry Wexler , president of Atlantic Records , heard `` The Windmills of Your Mind '' on the soundtrack of The Thomas Crown Affair and championed having Dusty Springfield record the song for her debut Atlantic album Dusty in Memphis , overcoming the singer 's strong resistance ; Springfield 's friend and subsequent manager Vicki Wickham would allege : `` Dusty always said she hated it because she could n't identify with the words . '' During the first sessions for the track at American Sound Studio in Memphis , problems with getting the proper chords down arose , and at Springfield 's suggestion the song was arranged so the first three verses were sung in a slower tempo than the original film version .
