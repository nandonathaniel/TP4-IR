The Romance languages and the remaining Slavic languages have derived their words for the concept of `` translation '' from an alternative Latin word , traductio , itself derived from traducere ( `` to lead across '' or `` to bring across '' , from trans , `` across '' + ducere , `` to lead '' or `` to bring '' ) .
