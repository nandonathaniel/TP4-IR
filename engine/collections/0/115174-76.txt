This is important in Duthie 's theory of an Ur - Shrew insofar as he argues it is the original version of The Shrew upon which A Shrew is based , not the version which appears in the 1623 First Folio . As Oliver argues , `` A Shrew is a report of an earlier , Shakespearian , form of The Shrew in which Hortensio was not disguised as Litio . '' Oliver suggests that when Pembroke 's Men left London in June 1592 , they had in their possession a now lost early draft of the play . Upon returning to London , they published A Shrew in 1594 , some time after which Shakespeare rewrote his original play into the form seen in the First Folio .
