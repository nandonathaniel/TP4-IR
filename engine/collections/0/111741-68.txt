As with other Fox animated series such as Futurama , The Simpsons and American Dad ! , the show employs the `` changing element '' running gag in its opening credits . The gag present on Bob 's Burgers involves the store located to the right of the restaurant , which has a new , humorously named client in every episode ( such as `` Betty 's Machetes '' in `` Purple Rain - Union '' ) . Additionally , beginning with Season 2 , the pest control van in the sequence has the name of a different company on each episode ; the van read `` Rat 's all Folks ! Exterminators '' on all episodes of Season 1 . On certain episodes , an element is changed for a special night ( a flash frame saying `` HAPPY HALLOWEEN '' was shown during the title sequence of `` Fort Night '' ) .
