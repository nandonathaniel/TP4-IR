The uncertainty principle is not readily apparent on the macroscopic scales of everyday experience . So it is helpful to demonstrate how it applies to more easily understood physical situations . Two alternative frameworks for quantum physics offer different explanations for the uncertainty principle . The wave mechanics picture of the uncertainty principle is more visually intuitive , but the more abstract matrix mechanics picture formulates it in a way that generalizes more easily .
