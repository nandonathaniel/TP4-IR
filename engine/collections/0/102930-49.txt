Over the five years before the film 's release , DreamWorks Animation had substantially over-hauled its production workflow and animation software . How to Train Your Dragon 2 was the first DreamWorks Animation film that used `` scalable multicore processing '' , developed together with Hewlett - Packard . Called by Katzenberg as `` the next revolution in filmmaking '' , it enabled artists for the first time to work on rich , complex images in real time , instead of waiting eight hours to see the results the next day . The film was also the studio 's first film to use its new animation and lighting software through the entire production . Programs named Premo and Torch allowed much more subtlety , improving facial animation and enabling `` the sense of fat , jiggle , loose skin , the sensation of skin moving over muscle instead of masses moving together .
