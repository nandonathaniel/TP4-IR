The group travels to the site of Hook 's grave ( everyone in the underworld has a grave site ) and Emma pours the ale of Seonaidh potion ( Seonaidh is a Celtic water spirit from the Isle of Lewis ) on the ground but lacks the power to bring him back , although they get a glimpse of an injured Hook before the potion wears off . Regina uses the potion and finds the soul of her father Prince Henry . Prince Henry tells Regina she has come too far to betray her friends now and tells her she must stay . Regina races to the banishment site with Henry as Cora attempts to banish the elder Henry , only to see the flames die down and a pathway to heaven open up . Since Regina has chosen to stay , remain a hero , and is no longer under the influence of her mother , Prince Henry 's unfinished business is resolved . With his soul at peace , he is accepted into `` a better place , '' and departs the Underworld after saying goodbye to Regina and Henry , who meets his namesake for the first time . The heroes realize they could potentially rescue all the souls here , and continue their quest to find Hook with this in mind . Cora meets with the ruler of the Underworld , Hades , who wishes the heroes gone ( the clock on the broken tower will tick each time a soul leaves the Underworld ) , and punishes Cora for her failure with an eternity as a miller 's daughter once again .
