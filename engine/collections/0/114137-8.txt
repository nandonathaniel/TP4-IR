In another notable example , the finale of Steven Spielberg 's E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial was edited to match the music of his long - time collaborator John Williams : as recounted in a companion documentary on the DVD , Spielberg gave Williams complete freedom with the music and asked him to record the cue without picture ; Spielberg then re-edited the scene later to match the music .
