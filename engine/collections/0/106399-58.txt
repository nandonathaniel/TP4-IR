A controversial topic was the use of prisoners of war for the disposal of unexploded bombs , land - mines and munitions . Dangerous activities of this kind were expressly forbidden by the Geneva Convention . But , as mentioned above , Britain maintained that the Geneva Convention was not valid in the post-war period . Britain also argued that the prisoners in question had volunteered for these duties . At least three German POWs are known to have died while carrying out these hazardous tasks .
