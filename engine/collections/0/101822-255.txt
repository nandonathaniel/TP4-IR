Most of the surviving evidence concerns legionary centurions and it is uncertain whether their auxiliary counterparts shared their high status and non-military role . It appears that many auxiliary centuriones and decuriones were members of native provincial aristocracies who were directly commissioned . Auxiliary centurions risen from the ranks were thus probably less predominant than in the legions . Those rising from the ranks could be promotions from the legions as well as from the regiment 's own ranks . In the Julio - Claudian period , auxiliary centurions and decurions were a roughly equal split between citizens and peregrini , though later citizens became predominant due to the spread of citizenship among military families . There is little evidence about the pay - scales of auxiliary centurions and decurions , but these are also believed to have amounted to several times that of their men .
