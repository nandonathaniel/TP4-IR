The characterisation of another novel T helper subtype , T helper 17 cells ( T 17 ) has cast further doubt on the basic T 1 / T 2 model . These IL - 17 producing cells were initially described as a pathogenic population implicated in autoimmunity but are now thought to have their own distinct effector and regulatory functions . Of note , recent evidence suggest that functional plasticity is an intrinsic capacity of T helper cells . Indeed , a study in mice demonstrated that T 17 cells transform into T 1 cells in vivo . A subsequent study furthermore showed that extensive T helper cell plasticity is also prominent in man .
