Among the 34 U.S. states in February 1861 , seven Southern slave states individually declared their secession from the U.S. to form the Confederate States of America , or the South . The Confederacy grew to include eleven slave states . The Confederacy was never diplomatically recognized by the United States government , nor was it recognized by any foreign country ( although the United Kingdom and France granted it belligerent status ) . The states that remained loyal to the U.S. ( including the border states where slavery was legal ) were known as the Union or the North .
