The earliest mentions of the Nights refer to it as an Arabic translation from a Persian book , Hezār Afsān ( or Afsaneh or Afsana ) , meaning `` The Thousand Stories '' . In the 10th century Ibn al - Nadim compiled a catalogue of books ( the `` Fihrist '' ) in Baghdad . He noted that the Sassanid kings of Iran enjoyed `` evening tales and fables '' . Al - Nadim then writes about the Persian Hezār Afsān , explaining the frame story it employs : a bloodthirsty king kills off a succession of wives after their wedding night ; finally one concubine had the intelligence to save herself by telling him a story every evening , leaving each tale unfinished until the next night so that the king would delay her execution . In the same century Al - Masudi also refers to the Hezār Afsān , saying the Arabic translation is called Alf Khurafa ( `` A Thousand Entertaining Tales '' ) but is generally known as Alf Layla ( `` A Thousand Nights '' ) . He mentions the characters Shirāzd ( Scheherazade ) and Dināzād . No physical evidence of the Hezār Afsān has survived ; so its exact relationship with the existing later Arabic versions remains a mystery . Apart from the Scheherazade frame story , several other tales have Persian origins , although it is unclear how they entered the collection . These stories include the cycle of `` King Jali'ad and his Wazir Shimas '' and `` The Ten Wazirs or the History of King Azadbakht and his Son '' ( derived from the 7th - century Persian Bakhtiyārnāma ) .
