By international agreement , since 1954 the unit `` degree Celsius '' and the Celsius scale are defined by absolute zero and the triple point of Vienna Standard Mean Ocean Water ( VSMOW ) , a specially purified water . This definition also precisely relates the Celsius scale to the Kelvin scale , which defines the SI base unit of thermodynamic temperature with symbol K. Absolute zero , the lowest temperature possible , is defined as being exactly 0 K and − 273.15 ° C. The temperature of the triple point of water is defined as exactly 273.16 K ( 0.01 ° C ; 32.02 ° F ) . This means that a temperature difference of one degree Celsius and that of one kelvin are exactly the same .
