The first guys we did were Sampras and Agassi . They were hitting forehands that in general were spinning about 1,800 to 1,900 revolutions per minute . Federer is hitting with an amazing amount of spin , too , right ? 2,700 revolutions per minute . Well , we measured one forehand Nadal hit at 4,900 . His average was 3,200 .
