Before damming , the high granite formations produced a valley with an average depth of 1,800 ft ( 550 m ) and a maximum depth of over 3,000 ft ( 910 m ) ; the length of the valley was 3 mi ( 4.8 km ) with a width ranging from an eighth to a half of a mile ( 0.2 to 0.8 km ) . The valley floor consisted of roughly 1,200 acres ( 490 ha ) of meadows fringed by pine forest , through which meandered the Tuolumne River and numerous tributary streams . Kolana Rock , at 5,772 ft ( 1,759 m ) , is a massive rock spire on the south side of the Hetch Hetchy Valley . Hetch Hetchy Dome , at 6,197 ft ( 1,889 m ) , lies directly north of it . The locations of these two formations roughly correspond with those of Cathedral Rocks and El Capitan seen from Tunnel View in Yosemite Valley . A broad , low rocky outcrop situated between Kolana Rock and Hetch Hetchy Dome divided the former meadow in two distinct sections .
