The Angelica tour alone requires 14 truckloads of cargo and a core group of over 60 traveling cast , crew , and musicians . The production team insisted that each tour must be able to duplicate the original Broadway show 's choreography , which literally revolves around two concentric turntables on the stage . This led to the construction of four portable sets , two for each tour , so that one set can be assembled well in advance at the next stop while the tour is still playing at the last stop .
