Lee released a third EP of covers in May 2014 , to celebrate his 92nd birthday , called Metal Knight , in addition to a cover of `` My Way '' , it contains `` The Toreador March '' , inspired by the opera Carmen , and the songs `` The Impossible Dream '' and `` I Don Quixote '' from the Don Quixote musical Man of La Mancha. Lee was inspired to record the latter songs because , `` as far as I am concerned , Don Quixote is the most metal fictional character that I know '' . His fourth EP and third annual Christmas release came in December 2014 , as he put out `` Darkest Carols , Faithful Sing '' , a playful take on `` Hark ! The Herald Angels Sing '' . He explained : `` It 's light - hearted , joyful and fun ... At my age , the most important thing for me is to keep active by doing things that I truly enjoy . I do not know how long I am going to be around , so every day is a celebration , and I want to share it with my fans . ''
