Gush Emunim supporters have taken a repertoire of old religious songs and invested them with political meaning . An example is the song `` Utsu Etsu VeTufar '' ( They gave counsel but their counsel was violated ) . The song signifies the ultimate rightness of those steadfast in their beliefs , suggesting the rightness of Gush Emunim 's struggle against anti-settlement policy by the government .
