In this passage , Marx says that Napoleon prevented the `` bourgeois revolution '' in France from becoming fulfilled : that is , he prevented bourgeois political forces from achieving a total expression of their interests . According to Marx , he did this by suppressing the `` liberalism of bourgeois society '' ; and he did it because he saw `` the state as an end in itself '' , a value which supported his `` political aim of conquest '' . Thus , he substituted `` permanent war for permanent revolution '' . The final two sentences , however , show that the bourgeoisie did not give up hope , but continued to pursue their interests . Thus , for Marx , `` permanent revolution '' involves a revolutionary class ( in this case , the bourgeoisie ) continuing to push for , and achieve , its interests despite the political dominance of actors with opposing interests .
