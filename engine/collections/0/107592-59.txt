Like the extravaganza and the burlesque , the variety show was a comic and ribald production , popular from the middle to the end of the 19th century , at which time it had evolved into vaudeville . This form was innovated by producers like Tony Pastor who tried to encourage women and children to attend his shows ; they were hesitant because the theater had long been the domain of a rough and disorderly crowd . By the early 20th century , vaudeville was a respected entertainment for women and children , and songwriters like Gus Edwards wrote songs that were popular across the country . The most popular vaudeville shows were , like the Ziegfeld Follies , a series of songs and skits that had a profound effect on the subsequent development of Broadway musical theater and the songs of Tin Pan Alley .
