Quantity Unit Dimension Notes Name Symbol Name Symbol Symbol Luminous energy Q lumen second lm ⋅ s T ⋅ J The lumen second is sometimes called the talbot . Luminous flux / luminous power Φ lumen ( = cd ⋅ sr ) lm J Luminous energy per unit time Luminous intensity candela ( = lm / sr ) cd J Luminous flux per unit solid angle Luminance candela per square metre cd / m L ⋅ J Luminous flux per unit solid angle per unit projected source area . The candela per square metre is sometimes called the nit . Illuminance lux ( = lm / m ) lx L ⋅ J Luminous flux incident on a surface Luminous exitance / luminous emittance lux lx L ⋅ J Luminous flux emitted from a surface Luminous exposure lux second lx ⋅ s L ⋅ T ⋅ J Time - integrated illuminance Luminous energy density ω lumen second per cubic metre lm ⋅ s ⋅ m L ⋅ T ⋅ J Luminous efficacy η lumen per watt lm / W M ⋅ L ⋅ T ⋅ J Ratio of luminous flux to radiant flux or power consumption , depending on context Luminous efficiency / luminous coefficient V Luminous efficacy normalized by the maximum possible efficacy See also : SI Photometry Radiometry
