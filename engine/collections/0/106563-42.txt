The Bessemer process , invented by Sir Henry Bessemer , allowed the mass - production of steel , increasing the scale and speed of production of this vital material , and decreasing the labor requirements . The key principle was the removal of excess carbon and other impurities from pig iron by oxidation with air blown through the molten iron . The oxidation also raises the temperature of the iron mass and keeps it molten .
