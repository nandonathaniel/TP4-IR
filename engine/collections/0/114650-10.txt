A short circuit fault current can , within milliseconds , be thousands of times larger than the normal operating current of the system . Damage from short circuits can be reduced or prevented by employing fuses , circuit breakers , or other overload protection , which disconnect the power in reaction to excessive current . Overload protection must be chosen according to the current rating of the circuit . Circuits for large home appliances require protective devices set or rated for higher currents than lighting circuits . Wire gauges specified in building and electrical codes are chosen to ensure safe operation in conjunction with the overload protection . An overcurrent protection device must be rated to safely interrupt the maximum prospective short - circuit current .
