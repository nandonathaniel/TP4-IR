Outside the formal structure of schools and classrooms in the north is the extremely important `` social education '' . This education includes not only extracurricular activities but also family life and the broadest range of human relationships within society . There is great sensitivity to the influence of the social environment on the growing child and its role in the development of his or her character . The ideal of social education is to provide a carefully controlled environment in which children are exposed only to pro-Juche and anti-south influences . According to a North Korean official interviewed in 1990 , ' School education is not enough to turn the rising generation into men of knowledge , virtue , and physical fitness . After school , our children have many spare hours . So it 's important to efficiently organise their afterschool education ' .
