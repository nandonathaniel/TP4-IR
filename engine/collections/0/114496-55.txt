The Union sent troops and gunboats down the Cumberland River , and in 1862 captured Fort Donelson , Fort Henry , and Clarksville . On February 17 , 1862 , the USS Cairo along with another Union Ironclad came to Clarksville and captured the city . There were no Confederate soldiers to contend with because they had left prior to the arrival of the ships . White flags flew over Ft . Defiance and over Ft . Clark . The citizens of the town who could get away , left as well . Before they left , Confederate soldiers tried to burn the railroad bridge that crossed the Cumberland River . The fire did not take hold and was put out before it could destroy the bridge . This railroad bridge made Clarksville very important to the Union . The USS Cairo tied up in Clarksville for a couple of days before moving on to participate in the capture of Nashville .
