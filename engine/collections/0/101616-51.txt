Songs from the movie included `` Living in America '' by James Brown , and also music by John Cafferty ( `` Heart 's on Fire '' , featuring Vince DiCola ) , Survivor , Kenny Loggins , and Robert Tepper . Go West wrote `` One Way Street '' for the movie by request of Sylvester Stallone . Europe 's hit `` The Final Countdown '' , written earlier in the decade by lead singer Joey Tempest , is often incorrectly stated as being featured in the film due to its similarity to DiCola 's `` Training Montage . '' However , Europe 's track was not released as a single until late 1986 , after Rocky IV 's release .
