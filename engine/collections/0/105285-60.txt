`` I bought Thomas in 1948 when I was writing `` Tank Engine Thomas Again '' , and wanted to start modelling once more after a lapse of some twenty years . Thomas was one of Stewart Reidpath 's standard models with a heavy , cast white metal body , and was fitted with his `` Essar '' chassis and motor . Stewart Reidpath is now dead , and his motors , let alone spare parts for them , have been unobtainable for years ; but Thomas still keeps going ! He is , as you might expect from his age , a temperamental old gentleman , and has to be driven very carefully indeed . ''
