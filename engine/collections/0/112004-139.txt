The etymology of the name was not provided by Dahl . Pronunciation of Knid is said in the book to approximate adding a schwa between the `` K '' and `` nid '' , or in Dahl 's words , `` K'nid '' . Cnidaria is the name of the taxonomic phylum containing stinging aquatic invertebrates such as jellyfish and coral , itself derived from the classical Greek word for nettle , κνίδη . Vermicious is a real word , meaning `` worm like '' .
