This version of Canasta is widespread , especially in the United States , and it was the official tournament version used by the ( possibly defunct ) American Canasta Association . American Canasta can be found in few books . One notable exception is Scarne 's Encyclopedia of Card Games , where the author claims to have invented a game which he calls International Canasta . Most of the elements of Modern American Canasta can be found in Scarne 's International Canasta , although there are some differences .
