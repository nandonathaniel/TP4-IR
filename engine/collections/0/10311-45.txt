Playing in the Scottish Championship in season 2014 -- 15 provided Rangers with a more difficult challenge , with the club losing home and away to both Hibernian and Hearts and also losing away to Queen of the South in the first half of the season . Rangers also failed to beat Alloa either home or away in the league before losing 3 -- 2 to Alloa in the semi-final of the Scottish Challenge Cup . Amid mounting criticism , McCoist submitted his resignation intending to honour his 12 months notice period but was placed on ' gardening leave ' and replaced by Kenny McDowall on a caretaker basis . McDowall remained in charge for just three months before resigning in March 2015 . During his time in charge , Rangers won just three matches . Rangers then named former player Stuart McCall as their third manager of the season for the remaining fixtures . Under McCall , Rangers finished third in the league and then reached the Premiership play - off final , which they lost 6 -- 1 on aggregate to Motherwell .
