Secondly , the precipitate is converted to a more chemically stable form . For instance , calcium ion might be precipitated using oxalate ion , to produce calcium oxalate ( CaC O ) ; it might then be heated to convert it into the oxide ( CaO ) . It is vital that the empirical formula of the weighed precipitate be known , and that the precipitate be pure ; if two forms are present , the results will be inaccurate .
