The armed conflict lasted for the better part of a decade , until around 1920 , and had several distinct phases . Over time the Revolution changed from a revolt against the established order under DÃ­az to a multi-sided civil war in particular regions , with frequently shifting power struggles among factions in the Mexican Revolution . One major result of the revolution was the dissolution of the Federal Army in 1914 , which Francisco Madero had kept intact when he was elected in 1911 and General Huerta used to oust Madero . Revolutionary forces unified against Huerta 's reactionary regime defeated the Federal forces . Although the conflict was primarily a civil war , foreign powers that had important economic and strategic interests in Mexico figured in the outcome of Mexico 's power struggles . The United States played an especially significant role . Out of Mexico 's population of 15 million , the losses were high , but numerical estimates vary a great deal . Perhaps 1.5 million people died ; nearly 200,000 refugees fled abroad , especially to the United States .
