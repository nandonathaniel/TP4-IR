Under the Marxist - Leninist doctrine of state atheism in the Soviet Union , after its foundation in 1917 , Christmas celebrations -- along with other religious holidays -- were prohibited as a result of the Soviet anti-religious campaign . The League of Militant Atheists encouraged school pupils to campaign against Christmas traditions , among them being the Christmas tree , as well as other Christian holidays , including Easter ; the League established an anti-religious holiday to be the 31st of each month as a replacement . With the Christmas tree being prohibited in accordance with Soviet anti-religious legislation , people supplanted the former Christmas custom with New Year 's trees . In 1935 the tree was brought back as New Year tree and became a secular , not a religious holiday .
