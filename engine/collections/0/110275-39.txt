For screenwriter Derek Kolstad , both Alistair MacLean and Stephen King were huge influences in the creation of the story of John Wick in terms of characterisation and world - building , stating , with himself stating , `` MacLean could build a world , and King could surprise you by what the main character truly was capable of . '' Outside of films , Stahelski and Leitch drew inspiration from the visual stylings of the ' 60s and ' 70s as well as cinematic influences , including Sergio Leone , Akira Kurosawa , Steve McQueen , Lee Marvin , William Friedkin and Sam Peckinpah . With Stahelski himself stating , `` All the way back to Kurosawa up to Sergio Leone . We like the spaghetti western sensibility there , some of the composition . '' Albeit inspiration and emulation from the noir film genre , Stahelski too added that , `` Noir maybe was sort of less impactful for us than the other sort of westerns and Kurosawa and things like that . I think we wanted to make this hard - boiled character . ''
