After the Revolution , genuinely democratic politics became possible in the former colonies . The rights of the people were incorporated into state constitutions . Concepts of liberty , individual rights , equality among men and hostility toward corruption became incorporated as core values of liberal republicanism . The greatest challenge to the old order in Europe was the challenge to inherited political power and the democratic idea that government rests on the consent of the governed . The example of the first successful revolution against a European empire , and the first successful establishment of a republican form of democratically elected government , provided a model for many other colonial peoples who realized that they too could break away and become self - governing nations with directly elected representative government .
