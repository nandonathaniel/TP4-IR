Bermuda had been largely left to the defences of its own militia and privateers before U.S. independence , but the Royal Navy had begun buying up land and operating from there in 1795 , as its location was a useful substitute for the lost U.S. ports . It originally was intended to be the winter headquarters of the North American Squadron , but the war saw it rise to a new prominence . As construction work progressed through the first half of the 19th century , Bermuda became the permanent naval headquarters in Western waters , housing the Admiralty and serving as a base and dockyard . The military garrison was built up to protect the naval establishment , heavily fortifying the archipelago that came to be described as the `` Gibraltar of the West '' . Defence infrastructure would remain the central leg of Bermuda 's economy until after World War II .
