The escape velocity is independent of the mass of the escaping object . It does not matter if the mass is 1 kg or 1,000 kg ; what differs is the amount of energy required . For an object of mass m ( \ displaystyle m ) the energy required to escape the Earth 's gravitational field is GMm / r , a function of the object 's mass ( where r is the radius of the Earth , G is the gravitational constant , and M is the mass of the Earth , M = 5.9736 Ã— 10 kg ) . A related quantity is the specific orbital energy which is essentially the sum of the kinetic and potential energy divided by the mass . An object has reached escape velocity when the specific orbital energy is greater or equal to zero .
