With Franco 's death in November 1975 , Juan Carlos succeeded to the position of King of Spain and head of state in accordance with the franquist law . With the approval of the new Spanish Constitution of 1978 and the restoration of democracy , the State devolved much authority to the regions and created an internal organisation based on autonomous communities . The Spanish 1977 Amnesty Law let people of Franco 's regime continue inside institutions without consequences , even perpetrators of some crimes during transition to democracy like the Massacre of 3 March 1976 in Vitoria or 1977 Massacre of Atocha . The ' founding chairman ' of the current leading political party in Spain , the People 's Party , was Manuel Fraga who had been a minister in Franco 's government and yet continued with his political career until shortly before his death in 2012 .
