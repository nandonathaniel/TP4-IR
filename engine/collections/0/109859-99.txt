Since the beginning of the 21st century , fast food has been criticized for its animal welfare record , its links to obesity and its environmental impact . Eric Schlosser 's book Fast Food Nation ( 2002 ) and Morgan Spurlock 's film Super Size Me ( 2004 ) reflected these concerns . Since 2003 , People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals ( PETA ) has protested KFC 's choice of poultry suppliers worldwide . The exception is KFC Canada , which signed an agreement pledging to only use `` animal friendly '' suppliers . PETA have held thousands of demonstrations , sometimes in the home towns of KFC executives , and CEO David Novak was notably soaked in fake blood by a protester . President of KFC 's US division Gregg Dedrick said PETA mischaracterized KFC as a poultry producer rather than a purchaser of chickens . In 2008 , Yum ! stated : `` ( As ) a major purchaser of food products , ( Yum ! ) has the opportunity and responsibility to influence the way animals supplied to us are treated . We take that responsibility very seriously , and we are monitoring our suppliers on an ongoing basis . ''
