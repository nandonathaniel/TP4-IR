A boxer named Catfish Lee ( Sonny Shields ) , and his crooked promoter and manager , Billy Ray ( Richard Schall ) , pick a fight with Luke so they can trick him into a boxing match and make a killing on tickets . When Catfish knocks Luke into Boss Hogg 's new $3,000 mirror at the Boar 's Nest , Boss demands that Luke fight Catfish in a match to pay for the mirror , or Jesse might be forced to sell the Duke farm in order to come up with the money . Luke , a former boxer , reluctantly agrees , but Catfish , Billy Ray , and their boss , Mr. Culpepper ( Eddie Ryder ) , set out to make sure Luke never gets to the match , so they can automatically get all the gate money without Boss Hogg getting any of it .
