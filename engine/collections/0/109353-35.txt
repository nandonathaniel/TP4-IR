Douglas 's attempt to finesse his way around the Missouri Compromise did not work . Kentucky Whig Archibald Dixon believed that unless the Missouri Compromise was explicitly repealed , slaveholders would be reluctant to move to the new territory until slavery was actually approved by the settlers , who would most likely oppose slavery . On January 16 Dixon surprised Douglas by introducing an amendment that would repeal the section of the Missouri Compromise that prohibited slavery north of the 36 Â° 30 ' parallel . Douglas met privately with Dixon and in the end , despite his misgivings on Northern reaction , agreed to accept Dixon 's arguments .
