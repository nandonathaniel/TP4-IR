In South Africa moonshine made from fruit ( mostly peaches or marulas ) is known as mampoer ( named after the Pedi chief Mampuru ) . The equivalent product made from grapes is called witblits ( white lightning ) . Witblits has a long history in the Western Cape Province ( over 200 years ) and many producers take pride in their product , which is widely available from liquor stores and at farmer 's markets . Most witblits is of a very high quality compared to typical moonshine worldwide and is generally comparable to grappa . A licence is required to distill alcohol in South Africa . A limited number of `` cultural heritage '' small - scale distillers are licensed .
