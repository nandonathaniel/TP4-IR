Alan Boyd , producer of The Generation Game at the time , remembers that there were many proposals as to who should take over . However , he felt he did not want the new programme to be comparable to Forsyth 's Generation Game ( he did not want the audience to be able to compare the two shows to think that Bruce was better or that the new host was better ) , so he cast Larry Grayson to take over , with a new theme tune and scenery , and a new co-host , Isla St Clair . It worked , as The Big Night failed to beat The Generation Game and was off the air within three months .
