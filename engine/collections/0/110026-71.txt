A mouse - related controller called the SpaceBall has a ball placed above the work surface that can easily be gripped . With spring - loaded centering , it sends both translational as well as angular displacements on all six axes , in both directions for each . In November 2010 a German Company called Axsotic introduced a new concept of 3D mouse called 3D Spheric Mouse . This new concept of a true six degree - of - freedom input device uses a ball to rotate in 3 axes without any limitations .
