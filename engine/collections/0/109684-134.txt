The Packers are the only community - owned franchise in American professional sports . Rather than being the property of an individual , partnership , or corporate entity , they are held in 2014 by 360,584 stockholders . No one is allowed to hold more than 200,000 shares , or approximately 4 % of the 5,011,557 shares currently outstanding . It is this broad - based community support and non-profit structure which has kept the team in Green Bay for nearly a century in spite of being the smallest market in all of North American professional sports .
