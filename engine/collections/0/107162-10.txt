The first English patent under the category of Washing machines was issued in 1791 . A drawing of an early washing machine appeared in the January 1752 issue of The Gentlemen 's Magazine , a British publication . Jacob Christian Sch√§ffer 's washing machine design was published 1767 in Germany . In 1782 , Henry Sidgier issued a British patent for a rotating drum washer , and in the 1790s Edward Beetham sold numerous `` patent washing mills '' in England . One of the first innovations in washing machine technology was the use of enclosed containers or basins that had grooves , fingers , or paddles to help with the scrubbing and rubbing of the clothes . The person using the washer would use a stick to press and rotate the clothes along the textured sides of the basin or container , agitating the clothes to remove dirt and mud . This crude agitator technology was hand - powered , but still more effective than actually hand - washing the clothes .
