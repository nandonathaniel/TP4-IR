The International Monetary Fund stated in June 2017 that annual growth in the economy was just over 4 % and that the financial system was sound . The IMF expressed concern however , about increasing deficits and public debt as well as the heavy dollarization of bank assets and liabilities . Costa Rica 's public debt is problematic , especially as a percentage of the GDP , increasing from 29.8 % in 2011 to 40.8 % in 2015 . Of the proposed 2017 budget ( US $15.9 billion ) , debt payments account for one - third of the total and a full 46 % of the budget will require financing . That will increase the deficit and the debt owed to foreign entities . The value of the Costa Rican colone per US $1 was 526.46 ₡ on March 27 , 2015 . At the end of July 2017 , the value was 563 ₡ .
