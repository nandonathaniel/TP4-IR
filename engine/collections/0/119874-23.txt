Confucianism has had a strong influence on the belief system in Asia for centuries , particularly in China , Japan , and Korea , and its influence can be seen in the way people chose to seek , or not seek , medical care . An important issue in Asia is societal effect on the ability of disabled individuals to adjust to a disability . Cultural beliefs shape attitudes towards physical and mental disabilities . China exemplifies this problem . According to Chinese Confucian tradition ( which is also applicable in other countries where Confucianism has been spread ) , people should always pursue good health in their lives , with an emphasis on health promotion and disease prevention . To the Chinese , having a disability signifies that one has not led a proper lifestyle and therefore there is a lack of opportunities for disabled individuals to explore better ways to accept or adapt to their disability .
