At Ford Motor Company , the assembly line concept appears to have been introduced by William `` Pa '' Klann upon his return from visiting Swift & Company 's slaughterhouse in Chicago and viewing what was referred to as the `` disassembly line '' , where carcasses were butchered as they moved along a conveyor . The efficiency of one person removing the same piece over and over without himself moving caught his attention . He reported the idea to Peter E. Martin , soon to be head of Ford production , who was doubtful at the time but encouraged him to proceed . Others at Ford have claimed to have put the idea forth to Henry Ford , but Pa Klann 's slaughterhouse revelation is well documented in the archives at the Henry Ford Museum and elsewhere , making him an important contributor to the modern automated assembly line concept . Ford was appreciative , having visited the highly automated 40 - acre Sears mail order handling facility around 1906 . At Ford , the process was an evolution by trial and error of a team consisting primarily of Peter E. Martin , the factory superintendent ; Charles E. Sorensen , Martin 's assistant ; Clarence W. Avery ; C. Harold Wills , draftsman and toolmaker ; Charles Ebender ; and JÃ³zsef Galamb . Some of the groundwork for such development had recently been laid by the intelligent layout of machine tool placement that Walter Flanders had been doing at Ford up to 1908 .
