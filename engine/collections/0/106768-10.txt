The Proclamation ordered the freedom of all slaves in ten states . Because it was issued under the president 's authority to suppress rebellion ( war powers ) , it necessarily excluded areas not in rebellion , but still applied to more than 3 million of the 4 million slaves . The Proclamation was based on the president 's constitutional authority as commander in chief of the armed forces ; it was not a law passed by Congress . The Proclamation was issued in January 1863 after U.S government issued a series of warnings in the summer of 1862 under the Second Confiscation Act , allowing Southern Confederate supporters 60 days to surrender , or face confiscation of land and slaves . The Proclamation also ordered that suitable persons among those freed could be enrolled into the paid service of United States ' forces , and ordered the Union Army ( and all segments of the Executive branch ) to `` recognize and maintain the freedom of '' the ex-slaves . The Proclamation did not compensate the owners , did not outlaw slavery , and did not grant citizenship to the ex-slaves ( called freedmen ) . It made the eradication of slavery an explicit war goal , in addition to the goal of reuniting the Union .
