In England and Wales , life imprisonment is a sentence which lasts until the death of the prisoner , although in most cases the prisoner will be eligible for parole ( officially termed `` early release '' ) after a fixed period set by the judge . This period is known as the `` minimum term '' ( previously known as the `` tariff '' ) . In some exceptionally grave cases , however , a judge may order that a life sentence should mean life by making a `` whole life order . ''
