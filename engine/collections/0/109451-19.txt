Under the new king , Louis XVI , radical financial reforms by his ministers , Turgot and Malesherbes , angered the nobles and were blocked by the parlements who insisted that the king did not have the legal right to levy new taxes . So , in 1776 , Turgot was dismissed and Malesherbes resigned . They were replaced by Jacques Necker , who supported the American Revolution and proceeded with a policy of taking large international loans instead of raising taxes .
