In the aftermath of the last glacial period , water levels in the Black Sea and the Aegean Sea rose independently until they were high enough to exchange water . The exact timeline of this development is still subject to debate . One possibility is that the Black Sea filled first , with excess fresh water flowing over the Bosphorus sill and eventually into the Mediterranean Sea . There are also catastrophic scenarios , such as the `` Black Sea deluge theory '' put forward by William Ryan , Walter Pitman and Petko Dimitrov .
