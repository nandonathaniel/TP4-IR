The White Nile was even less understood . The ancients mistakenly believed that the Niger River represented the upper reaches of the White Nile . For example , Pliny the Elder wrote that the Nile had its origins `` in a mountain of lower Mauretania '' , flowed above ground for `` many days '' distance , then went underground , reappeared as a large lake in the territories of the Masaesyli , then sank again below the desert to flow underground `` for a distance of 20 days ' journey till it reaches the nearest Ethiopians . '' A merchant named Diogenes reported that the Nile 's water attracted game such as buffalo .
