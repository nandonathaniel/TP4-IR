Henry has in his possession a large book of fairy tales and is convinced that Emma is the daughter of Snow White ( Ginnifer Goodwin ) and Prince Charming ( Josh Dallas ) , who sent her away so she would be protected from a powerful curse enacted by the Evil Queen ( Lana Parrilla ) , a curse in which the queen is the only one with a happy ending . It 's because of the curse that everyone in Storybrooke is frozen in time with no memories of their former selves -- except for the Queen , who is Storybrooke 's mayor and Henry 's adoptive mother , Regina Mills . Emma refuses to believe a word of Henry 's `` theory '' and returns Henry home , but then decides to remain in the New England town after getting attached to Henry which causes the hands of the clock tower to move for the first time in 28 years .
