After the war , the Continental Army was quickly given land certificates and disbanded in a reflection of the republican distrust of standing armies . State militias became the new nation 's sole ground army , with the exception of a regiment to guard the Western Frontier and one battery of artillery guarding West Point 's arsenal . However , because of continuing conflict with Native Americans , it was soon realized that it was necessary to field a trained standing army . The Regular Army was at first very small and after General St. Clair 's defeat at the Battle of the Wabash , the Regular Army was reorganized as the Legion of the United States , which was established in 1791 and renamed the United States Army in 1796 .
