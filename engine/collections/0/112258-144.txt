Investigators compiled a series of images of the moons Nix and Hydra taken from January 27 through February 8 , 2015 , beginning at a range of 201 million kilometers ( 125,000,000 mi ) . Pluto and Charon appear as a single overexposed object at the center . The right side image has been processed to remove the background starfield . The yet smaller two moons , Kerberos and Styx were seen on photos taken on April 25 . Starting May 11 a hazard search was performed , by looking for unknown objects that could be a danger to the spacecraft , such as rings or more moons , which were possible to avoid by a course change .
