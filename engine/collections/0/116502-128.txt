The minting of silver coinage began during the reign of Alexander I as a means to pay for royal expenditures . Archelaus I increased the silver content of his coins as well as minting copper coins to promote foreign and domestic commerce . The minting of coinage significantly increased during the reigns of Philip II and Alexander the Great , especially after the increase in state revenues following the seizure of the Pangaion Hills . During the Hellenistic period the royal houses of Macedonia , Ptolemaic Egypt , and the Kingdom of Pergamon exercised full monopolistic control over mining activities , largely to ensure the funding of their armies . By the end of the conquests of Alexander the Great , nearly thirty mints stretching from Macedonia to Babylon produced standard coins . The right to mint coins was shared by central and some local governments , i.e. the autonomous municipal governments of Thessaloniki , Pella , and Amphipolis within the Macedonian commonwealth . The Macedonians were also the first to issue different coins for internal and external circulation .
