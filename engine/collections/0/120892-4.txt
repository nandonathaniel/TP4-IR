Rutherford presented his own physical model for subatomic structure , as an interpretation for the unexpected experimental results . In it , the atom is made up of a central charge ( this is the modern atomic nucleus , though Rutherford did not use the term `` nucleus '' in his paper ) surrounded by a cloud of ( presumably ) orbiting electrons . In this May 1911 paper , Rutherford only committed himself to a small central region of very high positive or negative charge in the atom .
