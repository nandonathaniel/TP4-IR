Gene Siskel , in his review in the Chicago Tribune , gave the film two stars and complained that the film failed to tell the audience when the clock started on the beer run , thus removing suspense throughout the film concerning how long remained to them . He also claimed that Bandit is never made aware of Frog 's leaving Junior at the altar , which is why the Bandit continually asks why a Texas sheriff is chasing him . However , this is inaccurate : within seconds of Bandit picking her up , Frog tells him `` there is a wedding in search of a bride '' , and goes on to explain her ill - advised romance with Junior , as Bandit holds up the CB mic for Snowman to hear .
