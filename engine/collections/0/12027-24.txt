Since 2002 , half dollars have been minted only for collectors , due to large Federal Reserve and government inventories on hand of pre-2001 pieces ; this is mostly due to lack of demand and large quantity returns from casino slot machines that now operate `` coinless '' . Eventually , when the reserve supply runs low , the mint will again fill orders for circulation half dollars . It took about 18 years ( 1981 -- 1999 ) for the large inventory stockpile of a similar low - demand circulation coin , the $1 coin , to reach reserve levels low enough to again produce circulation pieces . Modern - date half dollars can be purchased in proof sets , mint sets , rolls , and bags from the U.S. Mint , and existing inventory circulation pieces can be ordered through most U.S. banks . All collector issues since 2001 have had much lower mintages than in previous years . Although intended only for collectors , these post-2001 half dollars sometimes find their way into circulation .
