After the surrender of the Empire of Japan , construction on Illinois and Kentucky stopped . Illinois was eventually scrapped , but Kentucky 's construction had advanced enough that several plans were proposed to complete Kentucky as a guided missile battleship ( BBG ) by removing the aft turret and installing a missile system . A similar conversion had already been performed on the battleship Mississippi ( BB - 41 / AG - 128 ) to test the RIM - 2 Terrier missile after World War II . One such proposal came from Rear Admiral W.K. Mendenhall , Chairman of the Ship ( s ) Characteristics Board ( SCB ) ; Mendehall proposed a plan that called for $15 -- 30 million to be spent to allow Kentucky to be completed as a guided - missile battleship ( BBG ) carrying eight SSM - N - 8 Regulus II guided missiles with a range of 1,000 nautical miles ( 1,900 km ; 1,200 mi ) . He also suggested Terrier or RIM - 8 Talos launchers to supplement the AA guns and proposed nuclear ( instead of conventional ) shells for the 16 - inch guns . This never materialized , and Kentucky was ultimately sold for scrap in 1958 , although her bow was used to repair her sister Wisconsin after a collision on 6 May 1956 , earning her the nickname WisKy .
