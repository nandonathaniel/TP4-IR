In November 2008 , Rhino released Live at the Matrix 1967 , a double live album compiled and resequenced from recordings made on March 7 and 10 , 1967 at the Matrix in San Francisco by club co-owner Peter Abram . The recording is notable because it is one of the earliest live recordings of the band known to exist : The Doors had recorded only one album by March 1967 , `` Light My Fire '' had yet to be released as a single , and they were still relatively unknown outside Southern California .
