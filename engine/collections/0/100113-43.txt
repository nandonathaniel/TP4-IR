In November 1940 , Waugh was posted to a commando unit , and , after further training , became a member of `` Layforce '' , under Colonel ( later Brigadier ) Robert Laycock . In February 1941 , the unit sailed to the Mediterranean , where it participated in an unsuccessful attempt to recapture Bardia , on the Libyan coast . In May , Layforce was required to assist in the evacuation of Crete : Waugh was shocked by the disorder and its loss of discipline and , as he saw it , the cowardice of the departing troops . In July , during the roundabout journey home by troop ship , he wrote Put Out More Flags ( 1942 ) , a novel of the war 's early months in which he returned to the literary style he had used in the 1930s . Back in Britain , more training and waiting followed until , in May 1942 , he was transferred to the Royal Horse Guards , on Laycock 's recommendation . On 10 June 1942 , Laura gave birth to Margaret , the couple 's fourth child .
