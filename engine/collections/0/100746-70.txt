The popularity of many of these `` other boards '' over the earlier ESP - xx modules is the inclusion of an on - board USB - to - UART bridge ( like the Silicon Labs ' CP2102 or the WCH CH340G ) and a Micro-USB connector coupled with a 3.3 volt regulator to provide both power to the board and connectivity to the host ( software development ) computer commonly referred to as the console . With earlier ESP - xx modules , these two items ( the USB - to - Serial adaptor and a 3.3 volt regulator ) had to be purchased separately and be wired into the ESP - xx circuit . Modern ESP8266 boards like the NodeMCU boards are a lot less painful and offer more GPIO pins to play with . Most of these `` other boards '' are based on the ESP - 12E module , but new modules are being introduced seemingly every few months .
