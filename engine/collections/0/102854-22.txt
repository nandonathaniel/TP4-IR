Brown did not plan to have a sudden raid and escape to the mountains . Rather , he intended to use those rifles and pikes he captured at the arsenal , in addition to those he brought along , to arm rebellious slaves with the aim of striking terror in the slaveholders in Virginia . He believed that on the first night of action , 200 - 500 black slaves would join his line . He ridiculed the militia and regular army that might oppose him . He planned to send agents to nearby plantations , rallying the slaves . He planned to hold Harpers Ferry for a short time , expecting that as many volunteers , white and black , would join him as would form against him . He would move rapidly southward , sending out armed bands along the way . They would free more slaves , obtain food , horses and hostages , and destroy slaveholders ' morale . Brown planned to follow the Appalachian Mountains south into Tennessee and even Alabama , the heart of the South , making forays into the plains on either side .
