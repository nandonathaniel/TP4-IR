Miss Sis Boombah : A matronly , cheerleading Rhode Island Red hen , who is a gym coach and fitness enthusiast -- as well as a close friend of Miz Beaver -- usually attired in tennis shoes and a pullover . Boombah arrives at the swamp to conduct a survey for `` Dr. Whimsy '' on `` the sectional habits of U.S. mailmen , '' a neat parody of The Kinsey Reports . She also runs a Feminist organization ( with Miz Beaver ) called `` F.O.O.F. '' ( Female Order Of Freedom ) , to un-subjugate the swamp womenfolk .
