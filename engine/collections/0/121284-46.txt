A federation ( also known as a federal state ) is a political entity characterized by a union of partially self - governing states or regions under a central ( federal ) government . In a federation , the self - governing status of the component states , as well as the division of power between them and the central government , is typically constitutionally entrenched and may not be altered by a unilateral decision of either party , the states or the federal political body . Alternatively , federation is a form of government in which sovereign power is formally divided between a central authority and a number of constituent regions so that each region retains some degree of control over its internal affairs .
