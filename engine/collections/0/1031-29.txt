In active mode , the client starts listening for incoming data connections from the server on port M. It sends the FTP command PORT M to inform the server on which port it is listening . The server then initiates a data channel to the client from its port 20 , the FTP server data port . In situations where the client is behind a firewall and unable to accept incoming TCP connections , passive mode may be used . In this mode , the client uses the control connection to send a PASV command to the server and then receives a server IP address and server port number from the server , which the client then uses to open a data connection from an arbitrary client port to the server IP address and server port number received .
