Despite the Rolling Stones ' predilection for blues and R&B numbers on their early live set lists , the first original compositions by the band reflected a more wide - ranging interest . The first Jagger / Richards single , `` Tell Me ( You 're Coming Back ) '' , has been described by critic Richie Unterberger as a `` pop rock ballad ... When ( Jagger and Richards ) began to write songs , they were usually not derived from the blues , but were often surprisingly fey , slow , Mersey - type pop numbers '' . `` As Tears Go By '' , the ballad originally written for Marianne Faithfull , was one of the first songs written by Jagger and Richards and also one of many written by the duo for other artists . Jagger said of the song , `` It 's a relatively mature song considering the rest of the output at the time . And we did n't think of ( recording ) it , because the Rolling Stones were a butch blues group . '' The Rolling Stones did later record a version which became a top five hit in the US .
