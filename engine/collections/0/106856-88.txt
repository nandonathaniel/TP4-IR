In 2010 , David Callaham pitched his take on Godzilla to Legendary and Warner Bros. and was hired to write the first draft . Speaking of his draft , Callaham stated , `` Godzilla is a pretty cut and dry , giant monster that smashes stuff . But the reason I got excited about it is because I saw themes and relationships to the modern world that I could tell in this story that was important . '' Callaham did research on Godzilla 's history , animal documentaries , as well as natural disasters and local government disaster plannings in order to depict the events as close as possible to real - life disasters .
