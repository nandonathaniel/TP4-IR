The Liberal government laid the foundations of the later comprehensive welfare state : introducing old age pensions ; maximum hour regulations ; pioneering minimum wage laws ; and developing a system for settling industrial disputes , which was accepted by both employers and trade unions . In 1893 it extended voting rights to women , making New Zealand the first country in the world to enact universal female suffrage .
