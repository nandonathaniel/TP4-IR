Presidents are required to approve all of a bill or none of it ; selective vetoes have been prohibited . In 1996 , Congress gave President Bill Clinton a line - item veto over parts of a bill that required spending federal funds . The Supreme Court , in Clinton v. New York City , found Clinton 's veto of pork - barrel appropriations for New York City to be unconstitutional because only a constitutional amendment could give the president line - item veto power .
