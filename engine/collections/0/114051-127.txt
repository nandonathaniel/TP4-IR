Bolsa Chica State Beach is operated by the State of California , Dept . Parks & Recreation , and the Bolsa Chica State Beach Lifeguards . The beach is very narrow and the sand is very coarse . Bolsa Chica tends to have better surf with NW / W swells during the winter season . During the summer months the beach picks up south / southwest swells at a very steep angle . Due to the bottom of the beach , surf at Bolsa Chica tends to be slowed down and refined to soft shoulders . Longboards are the best option for surfing in the Bolsa Chica area .
