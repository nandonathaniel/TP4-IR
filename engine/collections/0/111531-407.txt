A mix - up involving a coin flip for which final tasks Bill and Kwame would take ( which Bill won ) led to Bill also having the # 1 overall pick from the group of six fired contestants who returned to be tasked to a finalist 's mission . Kwame selected Omarosa as his 2nd team member ( after Troy ) because Bill had already drafted Amy and Katrina and made it clear he would NOT have Omarosa on his team . Kwame also did not want Nick on his team -- and knew that Bill would draft his friend and former teammate Nick with his last choice anyway -- and chose Omarosa instead of Heidi because he felt Heidi would work hard as the last person standing and Omarosa was unlikely to do that if she was angry .
