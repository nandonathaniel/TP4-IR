American football also plays a significant role in American culture . The Super Bowl is considered a de facto national holiday , and in parts of the country like Texas , the sport has been compared to a religion . Football is also linked to other holidays ; New Year 's Day is traditionally the date for several college football bowl games , including the Rose Bowl . However , if New Year 's Day is on a Sunday , the bowl games are moved to another date to not conflict with the typical NFL Sunday schedule . Thanksgiving football is an American tradition , hosting many high school , college , and professional games . Steve Deace of USA Today wrote that Americans are passionate about football `` because it embodies everything we love about American exceptionalism . Merit is rewarded , not punished . Masculinity is celebrated , not feminized . People of various beliefs and backgrounds -- a melting pot , if you will -- must unify for a common goal for the team to be successful '' . Implicit rules such as playing through pain and sacrificing for the better of the team are promoted in football culture .
