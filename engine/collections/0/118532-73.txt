When the Colonies declared independence , many Floridians condemned it . They had been almost unaffected ( because East and West Florida were backwoods areas ) by the Stamp Act Crisis of 1765 , which led the 13 colonies to perceive a common interest threatened by Britain . Florida declined to send delegates to the Continental Congress . The majority of Floridians were Loyalists , grateful to the Crown , that remained loyal to Britain . Many actually helped lead raids on the American South . One disastrous attempt on the part of the American Forces to invade East Florida occurred at the Battle of Thomas Creek in Nassau County . It was led on May 17 , 1777 . American Colonel John Baker surrendered to the British . Another attempt , the Battle of Alligator Bridge took place on June 30 , 1778 .
