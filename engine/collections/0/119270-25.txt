As a result of the killing of king Finwë , the majority of the Noldor , led by Fëanor son of Finwë , the maker of the Silmarils , declared their rebellion and decided to pursue Melkor , afterwards known as Morgoth , to Middle - earth to win back their jewels and avenge their king . The Noldor would not listen to Manwë , the lord of the Valar , telling them that they had themselves come to Valinor of their own free will and that the Valar had no desire to rule or control any of them . But Manwë 's messenger said also that if they choose to leave and to fight Melkor on their own , the Valar would not help them and that they would suffer great pain and grief on their journey .
