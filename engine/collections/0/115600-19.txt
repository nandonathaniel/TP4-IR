The first type used a system of partially reflecting surfaces to divide the light coming through the lens into three parts , each part passing through a different color filter and forming a separate image , so that the three images could be photographed at the same time on three plates ( flexible film had not yet replaced glass plates as the support for the emulsion ) or different areas of one plate . Later known as `` one - shot '' cameras , refined versions continued to be used as late as the 1950s for special purposes such as commercial photography for publication , in which a set of color separations was ultimately required in order to prepare printing plates .
