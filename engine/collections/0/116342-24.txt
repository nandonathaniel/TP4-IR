Dutch becomes a favorite of General Hawkes , and he is rewarded with a revised assignment flying the new Boeing B - 47 Stratojet at MacDill AFB , Tampa , Florida , across the bay from St. Petersburg where his old baseball team continues to conduct its spring training . Promoted to `` Full Bird '' colonel and made deputy wing commander of his B - 47 wing at MacDill AFB , Dutch decides , to Sally 's displeasure , to remain in the Air Force , rather than return to baseball at the end of his active duty obligation .
