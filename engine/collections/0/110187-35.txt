Robinson was fired at the end of the 1991 season . The return of Chuck Knox as head coach , after Knox ' successful stints as head coach of the Buffalo Bills and Seattle Seahawks , would not boost the Rams ' fortunes . His run - oriented offense marked the end of the Zampese tenure in 1993 . Knox ' game plans called for an offense that would be steady , if unspectacular . Unfortunately for the Rams , Knox ' offense was not only aesthetically unpleasing but dull as well , especially by 1990s standards . The Rams finished last in the NFC West during all three years of Knox ' second stint , and were never a serious contender .
