Reforms since 1997 have decentralised the UK by setting up a devolved Scottish Parliament and assemblies in Wales and Northern Ireland . The UK was formed as a unitary state , though Scotland and England retained separate legal systems . Some commentators have stated the UK is now a `` quasi-federal '' state : it is only `` quasi '' federal , because ( unlike the other components of the UK ) England has no legislature of its own , and is directly ruled from Westminster ( the devolved bodies are not sovereign and could , in theory at least , be repealed by Parliament -- unlike `` true '' federations , such as the United States , where the constituent states share sovereignty with the federal government ) . Attempts to extend devolution to the various regions of England have stalled , and the fact that Parliament functions both as a British and as an English legislature has created some dissatisfaction ( the so - called `` West Lothian question '' ) .
