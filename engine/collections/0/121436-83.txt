Secretary of the Department of Children and Family Services the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit upheld a state law barring adoption of children by homosexuals , holding explicitly that Lawrence did not apply strict scrutiny . In Witt v. Department of the Air Force , the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit held that Lawrence applied intermediate scrutiny .
