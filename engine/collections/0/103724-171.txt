During the Weimar Republic , it was accepted that a law did not have to conform to the constitution as long as it had the support of two thirds of parliament , the same majority needed to change the constitution ( verfassungsdurchbrechende Gesetze ) . That was a precedent for the Enabling Act of 1933 . The Basic Law of 1949 requires an explicit change of the wording , and it prohibits abolishing the basic rights or the federal structure of the republic .
