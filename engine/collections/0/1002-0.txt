The Parliament of India is bicameral . Concurrence of both houses are required to pass any bill . However , the authors of the Constitution of India visualised situations of deadlock between the upper house i.e. Rajya Sabha and the lower house i.e. Lok Sabha . Therefore , the Constitution of India provides for Joint sittings of both the Houses to break this deadlock . The joint sitting of the Parliament is called by the President and is presided over by the Speaker or , in his absence , by the Deputy Speaker of the Lok Sabha or in his absence , the Deputy - Chairman of the Rajya Sabha . If any of the above officers are not present then any other member of the Parliament can preside by consensus of both the House .
