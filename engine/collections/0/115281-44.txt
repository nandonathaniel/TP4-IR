Initially , media reports suggested that the subtitle , Sea Of Dreams , would accompany the second entry in the series . However , this subtitle was supposedly dropped , before 2K withdrew the statement , stating that the `` Sea Of Dreams '' subtitle would still be part of the full title . However , a later statement from 2K spokesman Charlie Sinhaseni clarified that the Sea Of Dreams title was for the trailer , and not for the game itself . The first appearance for BioShock 2 came in the form of a teaser trailer that was available in the PlayStation 3 version of the first game . The first major details on the gameplay and plot of the game were revealed in the April 2009 issue of Game Informer magazine , around the same time that the `` viral '' site `` There 's Something in the Sea '' was revealed . This site documents a man named Mark Meltzer 's investigation into the disappearances of girls from coastline areas around the Atlantic , along with a mysterious red light that accompanies each kidnapping . On April 9 , 2009 , on the Spike TV show GameTrailers TV with Geoff Keighley the first BioShock 2 gameplay video was shown featuring the Big Sister .
