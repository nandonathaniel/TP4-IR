The Riders host a meeting on Defenders of the Wing Island to discuss the threat Johann poses , however , Dagur and Mala constantly disagree with each other 's ideas . Through Ruffnut and Tuffnut 's mediation , Dagur and Mala actually get along and develop a mutual attraction for one another . Meanwhile , Hiccup and Snotlout travel to Wingmaiden Island to escort Atali to the meeting , where Atali leaves her second - in - command , Minden , in charge of the island , though Minden is upset at not being allowed to attend the meeting as well . When a fire breaks out on the other side of the island , Minden orders all the guards to put it out , leaving the Wingmaidens defenseless to a surprise attack from the Flyers , resulting in Atali being injured and knocked out . Feeling guilty over her mistake , Minden , with Snotlout 's aid , recovers the hidden Dragon Eye lens on their island , which the Flyers have come for . After her repeated failures , Minden loses hope and confidence in herself and quits being a Wingmaiden , but is inspired by Snotlout not to give up . Using the baby Razorwhips , the Wingmaidens defeat Flyers .
