In 1962 , UN secretary general U Thant provided valuable assistance and took a great deal of time , energy and initiative as the primary negotiator between Nikita Khrushchev and John F. Kennedy during the Cuban Missile Crisis , thus providing a critical link in the prevention of a nuclear war at that time . A 2005 RAND Corporation study found the UN to be successful in two out of three peacekeeping efforts . It compared UN nation - building efforts to those of the United States , and found that seven out of eight UN cases are at peace , as opposed to four out of eight US cases at peace . Also in 2005 , the Human Security Report documented a decline in the number of wars , genocides and human rights abuses since the end of the Cold War , and presented evidence , albeit circumstantial , that international activism -- mostly spearheaded by the UN -- has been the main cause of the decline in armed conflict since the end of the Cold War or due to the fact the US and USSR were no longer pumping up oppressive governments after the Cold war ended .
