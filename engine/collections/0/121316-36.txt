Lil Peep left high school early to move to Los Angeles and meet up with online friends . Initially living in Skidrow , Los Angeles and dipping in and out of homelessness , staying in childhood friend Brennan Savage 's apartment whilst Savage pursued a degree , the two went separate ways and Peep eventually met up with Memphis producer JGRXXN and Florida rappers Ghostemane and Craig Xen , living with them while forming the collective Schemaposse . According to Lil Peep , he originally met Craig Xen online and was introduced to JGRXXN who needed a singer . Lil Peep also attempted to attend Glendale Community College during his first year living in Los Angeles . In 2015 , Lil Peep released his first mixtape , Lil Peep Part One , which generated 4,000 plays in its first week . Shortly thereafter , he released his first extended play , Feelz , and another mixtape , Live Forever . Lil Peep began to grow in popularity soon after , with the song `` Star Shopping '' ( later released as a single following his death ) from Lil Peep Part One making waves in underground hip - hop circles . Lil Peep 's popularity continued to grow after the release of the song `` Beamer Boy '' which led to him performing live for the first time with the rest of Schemaposse in March 2016 in Tucson , Arizona . The following month , Schemaposse broke up and Lil Peep was not associated with any collective though they remained on good terms .
