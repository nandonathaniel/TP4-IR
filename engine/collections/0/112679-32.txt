Lyrically , `` Say My Name '' features a female protagonist calling her lover on the phone , and suspecting him of cheating . She asks him to `` say her name '' . The young man hesitates , and the narrator believes it 's because he does n't want the girl he 's cheating on her with to know who she is . Jerkins supported the song 's lyrics with a backing track that shifts back and forth in dynamics , steadily bringing different elements , including syncopated , 808 drum programming , synthesized strings , and 1970s - style wah - wah guitar licks , in and out of the mix . Knowles sings lead on the verses and bridge and leads the melody of the chorus with Kelly Rowland adding the second part harmony . LeToya Luckett sings the high harmony on the pre-chorus and second chorus . LaTavia Roberson sings second part harmony with LeToya on the pre-chorus and sings the bottom harmony late in the second chorus .
