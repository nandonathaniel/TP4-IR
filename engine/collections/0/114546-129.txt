The monarch is the `` fount of honour '' , the source of all honours and dignities in the United Kingdom . The Crown creates all peerages , appoints members of the orders of chivalry , grants knighthoods and awards other honours . Although peerages and most other honours are granted on the advice of the Prime Minister , some honours are within the personal gift of the Sovereign , and are not granted on ministerial advice . The monarch alone appoints members of the Order of the Garter , the Order of the Thistle , the Royal Victorian Order and the Order of Merit .
