Making matters worse , for the 1986 -- 87 season , ABC reduced Bandstand from a full hour to 30 minutes ; at Clark 's request , the 2,751 st and final ABC installment ( with Laura Branigan performing `` Shattered Glass '' ) aired on September 5 , 1987 . Two weeks later , Bandstand moved to first - run syndication , restored to its former hour length , and videotaped at KCET 's Studio B . The show 's new set was similar to that of Soul Train . Clark continued as host of the series , which primarily aired on NBC affiliates ( including KYW - TV , in the show 's former Philadelphia base ) , from September 19 , 1987 until June 4 , 1988 ; it was distributed by LBS Communications .
