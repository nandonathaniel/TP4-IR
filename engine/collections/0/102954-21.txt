Increasing gentrification in the East Village during the 1990s and 2000s , and enforcement of a park curfew and the eviction of homeless people have changed the character of Tompkins Square Park . As noted above , the park was closed and refurbished in 1991 and reopened in 1992 . Today , with its playgrounds and basketball courts , dog run , ping pong table , handball courts , and built - in outdoor chess tables , the park attracts young families , students and seniors and tourists from all over the globe .
