Washington was considered a key swing state in 1968 , and it was the only western state to give its electoral votes to Democratic nominee Hubert Humphrey over his Republican opponent Richard Nixon . Washington was considered a part of the 1994 Republican Revolution , and had the biggest pick - up in the house for Republicans , who picked up seven of Washington 's nine House seats . However , this dominance did not last for long , as Democrats picked up one seat in the 1996 election , and two more in 1998 , giving the Democrats a 5 -- 4 majority .
