In a December 2008 news story , it was reported that John Stamos was planning a reunion movie . This idea was quickly withdrawn , because reportedly most of the cast was not interested . In 2009 , Stamos announced that a feature film based on the show was still planned . Stamos told The New York Daily News , `` I 'm working on a movie idea , but it would n't be us playing us . I 'm not 100 % sure , but it would probably take place in the first few years . '' Stamos posited Steve Carell and Tracy Morgan for the roles of Danny and Joey respectively .
