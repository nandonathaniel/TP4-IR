Director D.W. Griffith , the top American filmmaker during the silent film period , was central to the development of film grammar , and producer / entrepreneur Walt Disney was a leader in both animated film and movie merchandising . Directors such as John Ford redefined the image of the American Old West and history , and , like others such as John Huston , broadened the possibilities of cinema with location shooting , with great influence on subsequent directors . The industry enjoyed its golden years , in what is commonly referred to as the `` Golden Age of Hollywood '' , from the early sound period until the early 1960s , with screen actors such as John Wayne and Marilyn Monroe becoming iconic figures . In the 1970s , film directors such as Martin Scorsese , Francis Ford Coppola and Robert Altman were a vital component in what became known as `` New Hollywood '' or the `` Hollywood Renaissance '' , grittier films influenced by French and Italian realist pictures of the post-war period . Since , directors such as Steven Spielberg , George Lucas and James Cameron have gained renown for their blockbuster films , often characterized by high production costs , and in return , high earnings at the box office , with Cameron 's Avatar ( 2009 ) earning more than $2 billion .
