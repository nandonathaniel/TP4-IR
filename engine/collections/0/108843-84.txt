There 's a lot of Chinese democracy movements , and it 's something that there 's a lot of talk about , and it 's something that will be nice to see . It could also just be like an ironic statement . I do n't know , I just like the sound of it . ( The album has ) a lot of different sounds . There 's some heavy songs , there 's a lot of aggressive songs , but they 're all in different styles and different sounds . It is truly a melting pot .
