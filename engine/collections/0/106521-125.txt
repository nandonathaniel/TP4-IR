When the Web developed in the 1990s , a typical web page was stored in completed form on a web server , formatted in HTML , complete for transmission to a web browser in response to a request . Over time , the process of creating and serving web pages has become dynamic , creating a flexible design , layout , and content . Websites are often created using content management software with , initially , very little content . Contributors to these systems , who may be paid staff , members of an organization or the public , fill underlying databases with content using editing pages designed for that purpose while casual visitors view and read this content in HTML form . There may or may not be editorial , approval and security systems built into the process of taking newly entered content and making it available to the target visitors .
