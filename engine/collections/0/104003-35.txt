The two teams formed the New Meadowlands Stadium Company , LLC ( now MetLife Stadium Company ) , a 50 / 50 joint venture , to build and operate the stadium . The two teams leased the parcel of land on which the stadium stands from the NJSEA for a 25 - year term , with options to extend it which could eventually reach 97 years . After the 15th year of the lease , and every five years , hence ; one of the 2 teams may opt out of the lease after giving the state 12 months notice . However , if one team leaves for a new stadium , the other team would have to remain for the remainder of the lease . Based on the teams ' histories , this clause presumably allows the Jets to eventually decide they want to play in their own stadium and leave if they can find a way to finance it . However , the high cost of building and relocating to a new stadium makes this very unlikely ( although the Jets have relocated their facilities to Florham Park , New Jersey ) . The teams also get parking revenue from the Meadowlands ' western parking lots year round , even when there are no events at the stadium ( this would occur when other parts of the Meadowlands host events ) .
