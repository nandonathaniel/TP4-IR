When Lewis Carroll was readying Alice 's Adventures Under Ground for publication he replaced a parody he had made of a negro minstrel song with a parody of Howitt 's poem . `` The Mock Turtle 's Song '' , in Lewis Carroll 's Alice 's Adventures in Wonderland , is a parody of Howitt 's poem ; it mimics the meter and rhyme scheme , and parodies the first line , but not the subject matter , of the original .
