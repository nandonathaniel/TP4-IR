Hundreds of animal paintings have been catalogued , depicting at least 13 different species , including some rarely or never found in other ice age paintings . Rather than depicting only the familiar herbivores that predominate in Paleolithic cave art , i.e. horses , cattle , mammoths , etc. , the walls of the Chauvet Cave feature many predatory animals , e.g. , cave lions , panthers , bears , and cave hyenas . There are also paintings of rhinoceroses .
