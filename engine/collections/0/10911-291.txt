Jerome returns in The Penultimate Peril . Feeling guilty at his desertion of the Baudelaires , he has been researching their case and writing a book about injustice entitled Odious Lusting After Finance ( a backronym of `` Olaf '' ) . He arrives with Justice Strauss to meet up with the Baudelaires and Dewey Denouement which led to them being confronted by Count Olaf . Jerome also meets his wife Esmé at the Hotel Denouement during the confrontation . When she dumps Count Olaf publicly , Jerome urges Esmé to rejoin his side . Esmé refuses his offer . When Dewey Denouement is accidentally killed during this confrontation which woke up all the patrons , Jerome states that the Baudelaires are n't murderers . He gives his book to Justice Strauss to be used as evidence against Count Olaf at Count Olaf and the Baudelaires 's trial which was met with a mix of cheers and hisses . His book was later used for kindling when Count Olaf started the fire at the Hotel Denouement . As the fire starts , Jerome is last seen on the first floor with the Man with a Beard But No Hair 's hand on him . When Jerome asks how arson is a good thing when he hears the Man with a Beard But No Hair praise Count Olaf , the Man with a Beard But No Hair changes his comment by helping the Woman with Hair But No Beard direct Frank and Ernest to the elevator .
