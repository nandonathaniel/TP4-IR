Proportionally , even though trade volumes trebled between 1870 and 1914 , the British share of the world market was actually shrinking . In 1880 , 23 percent of world trade was British - owned - by 1910 it was 17 percent . As foreign trade increased , so in proportion did the amount of it going outside the Continent . In 1840 , £ 7.7 million of its export and £ 9.2 million of its import trade was done outside Europe ; in 1880 the figures were £ 38.4 million and £ 73 million . Europe 's economic contacts with the wider world were multiplying , much as Britain 's had been doing for years . In many cases , colonial control followed private investment , particularly in raw materials and agriculture . Intercontinental trade between North and South constituted a higher proportion of global trade in this era than in the late 20th century period of globalisation .
