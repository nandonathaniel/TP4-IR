I may be wrong . No one can tell . There are no sure prophecies in politics , as even Bismarck owned . But just because all roads lead none knows whither , all the more reason to keep the straight path of honour . This is the really unpardonable thing in the conduct of Mr. Chamberlain . Even if what he did were the right thing to do , this was not the way to do it . Any really great man who had felt forced to sacrifice a small nation that trusted in him would at least have returned full of anguish and of shame . But Mr. Chamberlain , though he had good intentions , has no finer sense of honour . He lent himself with complacency to the shrieking adulation of a London that had lost all dignity , without one thought for the agony of Prague . Leaders should have some touch of finer mettle . Mr. Chamberlain , canting of `` peace with honour , '' has debased the moral currency of England . And not for the first time ; and not , I fear , for the last .
