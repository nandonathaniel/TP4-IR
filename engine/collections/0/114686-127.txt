Boron , silicon , germanium , arsenic , antimony , and tellurium are recognised commonly as metalloids . Depending on the author , one or more from selenium , polonium , or astatine are sometimes added to the list . Boron sometimes is excluded , by itself , or with silicon . Sometimes tellurium is not regarded as a metalloid . The inclusion of antimony , polonium , and astatine as metalloids also has been questioned .
