On December 1 , 2012 , Jovan Belcher , current member of the Kansas City Chiefs , shot and killed his fianc√©e , Kassandra Perkins , before committing suicide in the Arrowhead practice facility parking lot . On behalf of Belcher 's and Perkin 's daughter , lawyers have filed a wrongful death lawsuit against the Chiefs . Belcher 's mother has filed a similar suit accusing the Chiefs of ignoring Belcher 's cries for help as he complained of concussion like symptoms . The first occurrence came against Jacksonville in 2009 where Belcher was knocked unconscious and failed to receive adequate treatment . The second occurrence was against the Bengals in November 2012 . The lawsuits allege , Belcher `` suffered what should have been recognized as an acute concussion . '' However , one lawsuit continues , `` despite exhibiting obvious symptoms , Decedent was never removed from play for evaluation and recovery . '' The lawsuits also claims Belcher exhibited signs of CTE , including changes in his mood and behavior .
