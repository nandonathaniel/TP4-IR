In basketball , a turnover occurs when a team loses possession of the ball to the opposing team before a player takes a shot at his team 's basket . This can result from the ball being stolen , the player making mistakes such as stepping out of bounds , illegal screen , a double dribble , having a pass intercepted , throwing the ball out of bounds , three - second violation , five - second violation , or committing an error such as traveling , a shot clock violation , palming , a backcourt violation , or committing an offensive foul . A technical foul against a team that is in possession of the ball is a blatant example of a turnover , because the opponent is awarded a free throw in addition to possession of the ball .
