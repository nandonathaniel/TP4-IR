`` Rich Girl '' was written about an old boyfriend of Sara ( Allen ) 's from college that she was still friends with at the time . His name is Victor Walker . He came to our apartment , and he was acting sort of strange . His father was quite rich . I think he was involved with some kind of a fast - food chain . I said , `` This guy is out of his mind , but he does n't have to worry about it because his father 's gon na bail him out of any problems he gets in . '' So I sat down and wrote that chorus . ( Sings ) `` He can rely on the old man 's money / he can rely on the old man 's money / he 's a rich guy . '' I thought that did n't sound right , so I changed it to `` Rich Girl '' . He knows the song was written about him .
