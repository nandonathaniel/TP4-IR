Aristotle later created a systematic programme of teleological philosophy : Motion and change is described as the actualization of potentials already in things , according to what types of things they are . In his physics , the Sun goes around the Earth , and many things have it as part of their nature that they are for humans . Each thing has a formal cause , a final cause , and a role in a cosmic order with an unmoved mover . The Socratics also insisted that philosophy should be used to consider the practical question of the best way to live for a human being ( a study Aristotle divided into ethics and political philosophy ) . Aristotle maintained that man knows a thing scientifically `` when he possesses a conviction arrived at in a certain way , and when the first principles on which that conviction rests are known to him with certainty '' .
