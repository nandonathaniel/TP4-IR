In 1911 , the Reverend J. Frank Norris launched an offensive against racetrack gambling in the Baptist Standard and used the pulpit of the First Baptist Church of Fort Worth to attack vice and prostitution . When he began to link certain Fort Worth businessmen with property in the Acre and announce their names from his pulpit , the battle heated up . On February 4 , 1912 , Norris 's church was burned to the ground ; that evening , his enemies tossed a bundle of burning oiled rags onto his porch , but the fire was extinguished and caused minimal damage . A month later , the arsonists succeeded in burning down the parsonage . In a sensational trial lasting a month , Norris was charged with perjury and arson in connection with the two fires . He was acquitted , but his continued attacks on the Acre accomplished little until 1917 . A new city administration and the federal government , which was eyeing Fort Worth as a potential site for a major military training camp , joined forces with the Baptist preacher to bring down the final curtain on the Acre .
