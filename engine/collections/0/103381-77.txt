Boeing is studying plans to offer passenger to freighter conversion for the 737 - 800 . Boeing has signed an agreement with Chinese YTO Airlines to provide the airline with 737 - 800 Boeing Converted Freighters ( BCFs ) pending a planned program launch . In 2016 , Boeing officially launched the 737 - 800BCF program , converting old passenger jets to dedicated freighters . The first aircraft was delivered in 2018 to GECAS , which is leased to West Atlantic .
