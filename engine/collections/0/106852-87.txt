An average F1 car can decelerate from 100 to 0 km / h ( 62 to 0 mph ) in about 15 meters ( 48 ft ) , compared with a 2009 BMW M3 , which needs 31 meters ( 102 ft ) . When braking from higher speeds , aerodynamic downforce enables tremendous deceleration : 4.5 g to 5.0 g ( 44 to 49 m / s ) , and up to 5.5 g ( 54 m / s ) at the high - speed circuits such as the Circuit Gilles Villeneuve ( Canadian GP ) and the Autodromo Nazionale Monza ( Italian GP ) . This contrasts with 1.0 g to 1.5 g ( 10 to 15 m / s ) for the best sports cars ( the Bugatti Veyron is claimed to be able to brake at 1.3 g ) . An F1 car can brake from 200 km / h ( 124 mph ) to a complete stop in just 2.9 seconds , using only 65 metres ( 213 ft ) .
