Plant cells have a large central vacuole in the center of the cell that is used for osmotic control and nutrient storage . Contractile vacuoles are found in certain protists , especially those in Phylum Ciliophora . These vacuoles take water from the cytoplasm and excrete it from the cell to avoid bursting due to osmotic pressure .
