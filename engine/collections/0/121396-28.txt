Peter Ebdon , 2002 champion , appeared at the Crucible for the 24th time ( though not consecutively ) since first qualifying in 1992 but lost 5 -- 10 to 2015 champion Stuart Bingham . Peter Ebdon rescued the final frame of the first session via respotted black from a seemingly impossible position when 15 additional points were needed to equal the score in the 9th frame .
