With O'Connor elected an MP and Europe swept by revolution , it was hardly surprising that Chartism re-emerged as a powerful force in 1848 . On 10 April 1848 , a new Chartist Convention organised a mass meeting on Kennington Common , which would form a procession to present a third petition to Parliament . The estimate of the number of attendees varies depending on the sources ( O'Connor said 300,000 ; the government , 15,000 ; The Observer newspaper suggested 50,000 ) . Historians say 150,000 . The authorities were well aware that the Chartists had no intention of staging an uprising , but were still intent on a large - scale display of force to counter the challenge . 100,000 special constables were recruited to bolster the police force . In any case , the meeting was peaceful . The military had threatened to intervene if working people made any attempt to cross the Thames , and the petition was delivered to Parliament by a small group of Chartist leaders . The Chartists declared that their petition was signed by 6 million people , but House of Commons clerks announced that it was a lesser figure of 1.9 million . In truth , the clerks could not have done their work in the time allocated to them ; but their figure was widely reported , along with some of the pseudonyms appended to the petition such as `` Punch '' and `` Sibthorp '' ( an ultra-Tory MP ) , and the credibility of Chartism was undermined .
