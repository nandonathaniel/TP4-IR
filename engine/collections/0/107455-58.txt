This is the earliest occurrence in Christian literature of the phrase ' the Catholic Church ' ( ἡ καθολικὴ ἐκκλησία ) . The original sense of the word is ' universal ' . Thus Justin Martyr ( Dial. 82 ) speaks of the ' universal or general resurrection ' , using the words ἡ καθολικὴ ἀνάστασις . Similarly here the Church universal is contrasted with the particular Church of Smyrna . Ignatius means by the Catholic Church ' the aggregate of all the Christian congregations ' ( Swete , Apostles Creed , p. 76 ) . So too the letter of the Church of Smyrna is addressed to all the congregations of the Holy Catholic Church in every place . And this primitive sense of ' universal ' the word has never lost , although in the latter part of the second century it began to receive the secondary sense of ' orthodox ' as opposed to ' heretical ' . Thus it is used in an early Canon of Scripture , the Muratorian fragment ( circa 170 A.D. ) , which refers to certain heretical writings as ' not received in the Catholic Church ' . So too Cyril of Jerusalem , in the fourth century , says that the Church is called Catholic not only ' because it is spread throughout the world ' , but also ' because it teaches completely and without defect all the doctrines which ought to come to the knowledge of men ' . This secondary sense arose out of the original meaning because Catholics claimed to teach the whole truth , and to represent the whole Church , while heresy arose out of the exaggeration of some one truth and was essentially partial and local .
