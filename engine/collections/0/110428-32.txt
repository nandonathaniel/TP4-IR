In a letter to Eric Gutkind dated 3 January 1954 , Einstein wrote in German , `` For me the Jewish religion like all others is an incarnation of the most childish superstitions . And the Jewish people to whom I gladly belong and with whose mentality I have a deep affinity have no different quality for me than all other people . As far as my experience goes , they are also no better than other human groups , although they are protected from the worst cancers by a lack of power . Otherwise I can not see anything ' chosen ' about them . ''
