Though the cosmetic industry is predominantly responsible in ensuring the safety of its products , the FDA also has the power to intervene when necessary to protect the public but in general does not require pre-market approval or testing . Companies are required to place a warning note on their products if they have not been tested . Experts in cosmetic ingredient reviews also play a role in monitoring safety through influence on the use of ingredients , but also lack legal authority . Overall the organization has reviewed about 1,200 ingredients and has suggested that several hundred be restricted , but there is no standard or systemic method for reviewing chemicals for safety and a clear definition of what is meant by ' safety ' so that all chemicals are tested on the same basis .
