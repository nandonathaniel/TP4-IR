For most of its history , Pride was a seven - to - ten day festival centred on the final week in June , with the parade falling on either the last weekend in June or the first weekend in July depending on the year 's circumstances . As of 2016 , Pride is now declared as the entire month of June , with a program of events throughout the month leading up to the parade .
