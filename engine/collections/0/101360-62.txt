Elements are composed of one nuclide ( mononuclidic elements ) or of more naturally occurring isotopes . The unstable ( radioactive ) isotopes are either primordial or postprimordial . Primordial isotopes were a product of stellar nucleosynthesis or another type of nucleosynthesis such as cosmic ray spallation , and have persisted down to the present because their rate of decay is so slow ( e.g. uranium - 238 and potassium - 40 ) . Post-primordial isotopes were created by cosmic ray bombardment as cosmogenic nuclides ( e.g. , tritium , carbon - 14 ) , or by the decay of a radioactive primordial isotope to a radioactive radiogenic nuclide daughter ( e.g. uranium to radium ) . A few isotopes are naturally synthesized as nucleogenic nuclides , by some other natural nuclear reaction , such as when neutrons from natural nuclear fission are absorbed by another atom .
