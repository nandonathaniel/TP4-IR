Martel has mentioned that a book review he read of Brazilian author Moacyr Scliar 's 1981 novella Max and the Cats accounts in part for his novel 's premise . Scliar 's story describes a Jewish - German refugee crossing the Atlantic Ocean with a jaguar in his boat . Scliar said that he was perplexed that Martel `` used the idea without consulting or even informing me , '' and indicated that he was reviewing the situation before deciding whether to take any action in response . After talking with Martel , Scliar elected not to pursue the matter . A dedication to Scliar `` for the spark of life '' appears in the author 's note of Life of Pi . Literary reviews have described the similarities between Life of Pi and Max and the Cats as superficial . Reviewer Peter Yan wrote : `` Reading the two books side - by - side , one realizes how inadequate bald plot summaries are in conveying the unique imaginative impact of each book , '' and noted that Martel 's distinctive narrative structure is not found in Scliar 's novella . The themes of the books are also dissimilar , with Max and the Cats being an allegory for Nazism . In Life of Pi , 211 of 354 pages are devoted to Pi 's experience in the lifeboat , compared to Max and the Cats , in which 17 of its 99 pages depict time spent in a lifeboat .
