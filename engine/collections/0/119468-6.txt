Play between dogs usually involves several behaviours that are often seen in aggressive encounters , for example , nipping , biting and growling . It is therefore important for the dogs to place these behaviours in the context of play , rather than aggression . Dogs signal their intent to play with a range of behaviours including a `` play - bow '' , `` face - pawed '' `` open - mouthed play face '' and postures inviting the other dog to chase the initiator . Similar signals are given throughout the play bout to maintain the context of the potentially aggressive activities .
