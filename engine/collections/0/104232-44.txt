On March 25 , 1983 , Jackson reunited with his brothers for a performance taped at the Pasadena Civic Auditorium for Motown 25 : Yesterday , Today , Forever , an NBC television special . The show aired on May 16 , 1983 , to an estimated audience of 47 million , and featured the Jacksons and other Motown stars . It is best remembered for Jackson 's solo performance of `` Billie Jean '' , which earned Jackson his first Emmy nomination . Wearing a distinctive black - sequined jacket and a golf glove decorated with rhinestones , he debuted his signature dance move , the moonwalk , which former Soul Train dancer and Shalamar member Jeffrey Daniel had taught him three years earlier . Jackson had originally turned down the invitation to perform at the show , believing he had been doing too much television at the time ; at the request of Motown founder Berry Gordy , he agreed to perform in exchange for time to do a solo performance . According to Rolling Stone reporter Mikal Gilmore , `` There are times when you know you are hearing or seeing something extraordinary ... that came that night . '' Jackson 's performance drew comparisons to Elvis Presley 's and the Beatles ' appearances on The Ed Sullivan Show . Anna Kisselgoff of The New York Times wrote in 1988 : `` The moonwalk that he made famous is an apt metaphor for his dance style . How does he do it ? As a technician , he is a great illusionist , a genuine mime . His ability to keep one leg straight as he glides while the other bends and seems to walk requires perfect timing . '' Gordy said of the performance : `` From the first beat of ' Billie Jean ' , I was mesmerized , and when he did his iconic moonwalk , I was shocked , it was magic , Michael Jackson went into orbit , and never came down .
