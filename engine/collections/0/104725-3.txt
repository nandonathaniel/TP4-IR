Some scholars claim that the phrase originated in 17th - century slang , where a `` dead horse '' was work that was paid for in advance , e.g. `` His land ' twas sold to pay his debts ; All went that way , for a dead horse , as one would say . '' This attribution confuses `` flogging a dead horse '' with an entirely different phrase : `` to work ( for ) the dead horse '' . This phrase was slang for `` work charged before it is executed '' . This use of ' dead horse ' to refer to pay that was issued before the work was done was an allusion to using one 's money to buy a useless thing ( metaphorically , `` a dead horse '' ) . Most men paid in advance apparently either wasted the money on drink or other such vices , or used it to pay outstanding debts .
