After Missouri , Smith built the city of Nauvoo , Illinois as the new church headquarters , and served as the city 's mayor and leader of the militia . As church leader , Smith also instituted the then - secret practice of plural marriage , and taught a form of Millennialism which he called `` theodemocracy '' , to be led by a Council of Fifty which , allegedly , had secretly and symbolically anointed him as king of this Millennial theodemocracy . Partly in response to these trends , on June 7 , 1844 , a newspaper called the Nauvoo Expositor , edited by dissident Mormon William Law , issued a scathing criticism of polygamy and Nauvoo theocratic government , including a call for church reform based on earlier Mormon principles . Considering the paper to be libellous , Smith and the Nauvoo city council voted to shut down the paper as a public nuisance . Relations between Mormons and residents of surrounding communities had been strained , and some of them instituted criminal charges against Smith for treason. Smith surrendered to police in the nearby Carthage , Illinois , and while in state custody , he and his brother Hyrum Smith , who was second in line to the church presidency , were killed in a firefight with an angry mob attacking the jail on June 27 , 1844 .
