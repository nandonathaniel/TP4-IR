In 1970 , Blanda was released during the exhibition season , but bounced back to establish his 21st professional season . During that season , Blanda , at age 43 , had a remarkable five - game run . Against the Steelers , Blanda threw for three touchdowns in relief of an injured Daryle Lamonica . One week later , his 48 - yard field goal with three seconds remaining salvaged a 17 -- 17 tie with the Kansas City Chiefs . On November 8 , he again came off the bench to throw a touchdown pass to tie the Cleveland Browns with 1 : 34 remaining , then kicked a 53 - yard field goal with 0 : 03 left for the 23 -- 20 win . Immediately after the winning field goal , Raiders radio announcer Bill King excitedly declared , `` George Blanda has just been elected King of the World ! '' In the team 's next game , Blanda replaced Lamonica in the fourth quarter and connected with Fred Biletnikoff on a touchdown pass with 2 : 28 left in the game to defeat the Denver Broncos , 24 -- 19 . The following week , Blanda 's 16 - yard field goal in the closing seconds defeated the San Diego Chargers , 20 -- 17 .
