Michael handing out candy bars during his lectures is a reference to the third season episode , `` Business School '' , where Michael passed out chocolate bars during his speech to a business school classroom . Michael expresses regret for insulting Tony Gardner , the heavyset man who briefly transferred from the Stamford branch of Dunder Mifflin to the Scranton branch , who Michael drives to quit by trying to lift onto a table for an orientation demonstration in the third season episode , `` The Merger '' . Among the Dunder Mifflin branches Michael visits is Nashua , New Hampshire , where Holly works , and Utica , New York , where Karen works . Michael said he can only prepare for his lectures by listening to `` silence or Sam Kinison '' , an American stand - up comedian known for his extreme and vulgar sense of humor . Michael said he learned the Pledge of Allegiance , the lyrical oath of loyalty to the United States flag , by setting the lyrics to the rhythm of `` Old McDonald Had a Farm '' , a children 's song about the various animals on a farm . During one lecture , Michael and Pam both do impressions of the protagonist from Forrest Gump , the 1994 film starring Tom Hanks as a mentally handicapped man . Michael also uses the title from the films Good Morning , Vietnam ( at his Nashua lecture by saying `` Good morning , Vietna ... shua ! '' ) The Princess Bride , Gone with the Wind and Jerry Maguire in his lectures . Holly 's computer has a screensaver with images of Ed Grimley , the nerdy character with a cowlick played by comedian Martin Short in the comedy shows SCTV and Saturday Night Live .
