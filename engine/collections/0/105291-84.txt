When a metal ore is an ionic compound of that metal and a non-metal , the ore must usually be smelted -- heated with a reducing agent -- to extract the pure metal . Many common metals , such as iron , are smelted using carbon as a reducing agent . Some metals , such as aluminium and sodium , have no commercially practical reducing agent , and are extracted using electrolysis instead .
