Located in the west gallery , the Grand Organ of four manuals and 81 stops occupies a more commanding position than many British cathedral organs enjoy . Built by Henry Willis III from 1922 to 1932 , it remains one of the most successful and admired . One of Louis Vierne 's best - known organ pieces , `` Carillon de Westminster , '' the final movement from Suite no . 3 ( op . 54 ) of Pi√®ces de Fantaisie , was composed for it and dedicated to the builder . The apse organ of fifteen stops was built in 1910 by Lewis & Co . Although the Grand Organ has its own attached console , a console in the apse can play both instruments .
