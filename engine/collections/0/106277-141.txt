There was considerable negative reaction to the characters Mudflap and Skids , who some perceived as embodying racist stereotypes . Manohla Dargis of The New York Times said that `` the characters ( ... ) indicate that minstrelsy remains as much in fashion in Hollywood as when , well , Jar Jar Binks was set loose by George Lucas '' . Critic Scott Mendelson said `` To say that these two are the most astonishingly racist caricatures that I 've ever seen in a mainstream motion picture would be an understatement . '' Harry Knowles , founder of Ai n't It Cool News , went further , asking his readers `` not to support this film '' because `` you 'll be taking ( your children ) to see a film with the lowest forms of humor , stereotypes , and racism around . '' Bay ( the director ) has attempted to defend the film as `` good clean fun '' and insisted that `` We 're just putting more personality in . '' Writers Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman responded to the controversy with `` It 's really hard for us to sit here and try to justify it . I think that would be very foolish , and if someone wants to be offended by it , it 's their right . We were very surprised when we saw it , too , and it 's a choice that was made . If anything , it just shows you that we do n't control every aspect of the movie . ''
