The invention of the cavity magnetron made possible the production of electromagnetic waves of a small enough wavelength ( microwaves ) . The magnetron was originally a crucial component in the development of short wavelength radar during World War II . In 1937 -- 1940 , a multi-cavity magnetron was built by the British physicist Sir John Turton Randall , FRSE , together with a team of British coworkers , for the British and American military radar installations in World War II . A more high - powered microwave generator that worked at shorter wavelengths was needed , and in 1940 , at the University of Birmingham in England , Randall and Harry Boot produced a working prototype . They invented a valve that could spit out pulses of microwave radio energy on a wavelength of 10cm , an unprecedented discovery .
