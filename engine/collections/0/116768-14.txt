Historically , those who have committed crimes or other wrongs against the state have been declared legally dead despite being obviously alive . This is known as civil death . Such a person loses all rights normally granted a person . In jurisdictions that practiced civil death , it was legal to murder such a person , since they were not actually alive accordingly to the law , and therefore not actually killed .
