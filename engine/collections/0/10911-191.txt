In the Netflix TV series , Esmé is portrayed by Lucy Punch . She is said to be the original owner of the mysterious sugar bowl which was stolen from her by Lemony Snicket and Beatrice Baudelaire . Unlike the books , Esmé is shown to be strong enough to carry an unconscious Jerome back to her apartment . After she and Count Olaf fight in `` The Vile Village '' , Esmé begins to be much more interested in recovering this bowl than assisting Count Olaf in kidnapping the Baudelaires until he leads her to believe the Baudelaires have the bowl . In `` The Hostile Hospital , '' Esmé poses as a nurse where she says that her name is Nurse Cassandra Ursula Terrific Elliandra - before the rest of the name is cut off by Count Olaf in his alias of Mattathias Medicalschool .
