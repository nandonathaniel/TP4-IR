As the mesocyclone lowers below the cloud base , it begins to take in cool , moist air from the downdraft region of the storm . The convergence of warm air in the updraft and cool air causes a rotating wall cloud to form . The RFD also focuses the mesocyclone 's base , causing it to draw air from a smaller and smaller area on the ground . As the updraft intensifies , it creates an area of low pressure at the surface . This pulls the focused mesocyclone down , in the form of a visible condensation funnel . As the funnel descends , the RFD also reaches the ground , fanning outward and creating a gust front that can cause severe damage a considerable distance from the tornado . Usually , the funnel cloud begins causing damage on the ground ( becoming a tornado ) within a few minutes of the RFD reaching the ground .
