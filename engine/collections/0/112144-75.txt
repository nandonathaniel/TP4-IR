Bruce Mathis ( Stephen Collins ) is Dennis and Dee 's biological father . The antithesis of Frank , Bruce devotes his time and money to charities and philanthropic efforts , including adopting several suffering children in Africa . He reconnects with his twins through Dee 's MySpace page , but they are unable to have a successful relationship with him because of his good nature clashing with their selfish ways . Bruce had always been wealthy but never mentioned it to Barbara who assumed he was poor and was thus surprised to learn about his wealth years later . After Barbara 's death , he inherits Barbara 's fortune ( including her house , which originally went to Dennis until Mathis films evidence of Frank 's presence in the house , which was against the terms of Barbara 's will ) and calls The Gang `` the most horrible people alive .
