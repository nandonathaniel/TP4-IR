An important part of differentiated instruction and assessment is determining what students already know so as not to cover material students have mastered , or use methods that would be ineffective for students . The goal of pre-assessment is to determine a student 's knowledge , understanding and skill prior to the unit of study . These are assessments for learning and include diagnostic or pre-assessments that the teacher uses to help guide instruction and benefit each learner . They are informal and provide qualitative feedback to teachers and students to address strengths and needs during the unit . Pre-assessments should be conducted several weeks before the unit of study and should not be graded . Chapman and King ( 2005 ) note that when `` teachers strategically administer pre-assessments before planning their lessons , they can address the students ' strengths and needs during instruction . '' Pre-assessment can be conducted in two ways : 1 ) by identifying learning preferences and interests ( i.e. Gardner 's Multiple Intelligence test , or Visual , Auditory , or Kinesthetic learner ) , and 2 ) by identifying knowledge of student understandings ( i.e. checklists , quizzes , class discussion , portfolios , entry / exit cards , anticipation guides , journals , self - reflections ) . Both of these types of pre-assessment are used to design student tasks , particularly when a student might require support , enrichment , or have different learning styles , intelligence , or interests . Teachers can also determine , locate , and compile appropriate resources and decide timelines / priorities for upcoming units .
