Kajganich also mentioned that Warner Bros. wished for the adaptation to be rated R , saying , `` ... we can really honor the book and engage with the traumas ( both the paranormal ones and those they deal with at home and school ) that these characters endure '' . He said that his dream choice for Pennywise would be Buster Keaton if he were still alive , and that the Pennywise that he scripted is `` less self - conscious of his own irony and surreality '' . As of June 29 , 2010 , Kajganich was re-writing his screenplay .
