Twelve years later , an adult Einon ( David Thewlis ) has his castle rebuilt . Kara ( Dina Meyer ) asks the king to pardon her father after years of slavery , but Einon instead kills him in order to `` free '' him . As for Bowen , he has become a very skilled dragonslayer . Brother Gilbert ( Pete Postlethwaite ) , a monk and aspiring poet , observes Bowen slaying a dragon and follows him to record his exploits . Bowen stalks another dragon ( voiced by Sean Connery ) to its cave , but the confrontation ends in a stalemate . The dragon states that he is the last of his kind , and thus if Bowen kills him , he will be out of a job . The two form a partnership to defraud local villagers with staged dragonslayings . Bowen calls the dragon Draco , after the constellation . Unknown to Bowen , Draco is the dragon who shared his heart with Einon , and through this connection , any pain inflicted upon one is also felt by the other .
