On June 13 , 1847 , Commodore Perry assembled the Mosquito Fleet and began moving towards the Grijalva River , towing 47 boats that carried a landing force of 1,173 . On June 15 , 12 miles ( 19 km ) below San Juan Bautista , the fleet ran through an ambush with little difficulty . Again at an `` S '' curve in the river known as the `` Devil 's Bend '' , Perry encountered Mexican fire from a river fortification known as the Colmena redoubt , but the fleet 's heavy naval guns quickly dispersed the Mexican force .
