Sworn translation , also called `` certified translation , '' aims at legal equivalence between two documents written in different languages . It is performed by someone authorized to do so by local regulations . Some countries recognize declared competence . Others require the translator to be an official state appointee . In some countries , such as the United Kingdom , translators must be accredited by certain translation institutes or associations in order to be able to carry out certified translations .
