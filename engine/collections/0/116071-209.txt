In 1972 , in order to harmonise units of measure as part of a programme to facilitate trade between member states , the EEC issued directive 71 / 354 / EEC . This directive catalogued units of measure that could be used for `` economic , public health , public safety and administrative purposes '' and also provided instructions for a transition from the existing units of measure that were in use . The directive replicated the CGPM SI recommendations and in addition pre-empted some of the additions whose use had been recommended by the CIPM in 1969 , but had not been ratified by the CGPM . The directive also catalogued units of measure whose status would be reviewed by the end of 1977 ( mainly coherent CGS units of measure ) and also catalogued units of measure that were to be phased out by the end of 1977 , including the use of obsolete names for the sale of timber such as the stere , the use of units of force and pressure that made use of the acceleration due to gravity , the use of non-coherent units of power such as the Pferdest√§rke ( PS ) , the use of the calorie as a measure of energy and the stilb as a measure of luminance . The directive was silent in respect of units that were specific to one or two countries including the pond , pfund , livre ( Dutch , German and French synonyms for 500 g ) , thereby effectively prohibiting their use as well .
