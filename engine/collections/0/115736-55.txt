The northern Indian languages from the Indo - Aryan branch of the Indo - European family evolved from Old Indic by way of the Middle Indic Prakrit languages and Apabhraṃśa of the Middle Ages . The Indo - Aryan languages developed and emerged in three stages -- Old Indo - Aryan ( 1500 BCE to 600 BCE ) , Middle Indo - Aryan stage ( 600 BCE and 1000 CE ) and New Indo - Aryan ( between 1000 CE and 1300 CE ) . The modern north Indian Indo - Aryan languages all evolved into distinct , recognisable languages in the New Indo - Aryan Age .
