The Solar System formed 4.568 billion years ago from the gravitational collapse of a region within a large molecular cloud . This initial cloud was likely several light - years across and probably birthed several stars . As is typical of molecular clouds , this one consisted mostly of hydrogen , with some helium , and small amounts of heavier elements fused by previous generations of stars . As the region that would become the Solar System , known as the pre-solar nebula , collapsed , conservation of angular momentum caused it to rotate faster . The centre , where most of the mass collected , became increasingly hotter than the surrounding disc . As the contracting nebula rotated faster , it began to flatten into a protoplanetary disc with a diameter of roughly 200 AU and a hot , dense protostar at the centre . The planets formed by accretion from this disc , in which dust and gas gravitationally attracted each other , coalescing to form ever larger bodies . Hundreds of protoplanets may have existed in the early Solar System , but they either merged or were destroyed , leaving the planets , dwarf planets , and leftover minor bodies .
