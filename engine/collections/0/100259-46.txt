As a legislative review mechanism , it plays a `` limited quasi Second Chamber '' role . It has also been called `` the closest body ( Singapore has ) to a Second Chamber for many years '' . However , the Council has been criticized for lacking teeth to act as a real check on potential legislative abuses . As of 2009 , the PCMR had not issued an adverse report regarding any piece of legislation referred to it . Nevertheless , it forms part of the statutory framework for the People 's Action Party government 's internationally lauded efforts in managing minority issues in multiethnic Singapore . Former Deputy Prime Minister S. Jayakumar , formerly a member of the Council , has noted that the PCMR is also a symbol of the paramount importance placed on racial harmony in a world still rife with racial and communal conflict .
