After two rainy summers in 1664 and 1665 , London had lain under an exceptional drought since November 1665 , and the wooden buildings were tinder - dry after the long hot summer of 1666 . A fire broke out at Thomas Farriner 's bakery in Pudding Lane a little after midnight on Sunday 2 September . The family was trapped upstairs but managed to climb from an upstairs window to the house next door , except for a maidservant who was too frightened to try , who became the first victim . The neighbours tried to help douse the fire ; after an hour , the parish constables arrived and judged that the adjoining houses had better be demolished to prevent further spread . The householders protested , and Lord Mayor Sir Thomas Bloodworth was summoned , who alone had the authority to override their wishes .
