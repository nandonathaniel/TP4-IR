United States : In the early 1990s US West ( subsequently Qwest and now CenturyLink ) launched a Minitel service in the Minneapolis and Omaha markets called `` CommunityLink '' . This joint venture of US West and France Télécom provided Minitel content to IBM PC , Commodore 64 and Apple II owners using a Minitel - emulating software application over a dialup modem . Many of the individual services were the same as or similar to those offered by France Télécom to the French market ; in fact , some chat services linked up with France Télécom 's network in France . The service was fairly short - lived as competing offerings from providers like AOL , Prodigy , and CompuServe provided more services targeted at American users for a lower price . Many of US West 's Minitel offerings were charged à la carte or hourly while competitors offered monthly all - inclusive pricing .
