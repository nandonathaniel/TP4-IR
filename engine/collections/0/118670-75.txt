A monument installed on the Colorado State Capitol grounds in 1909 lists Sand Creek as one of the `` battles and engagements '' fought by Colorado troops in the American Civil War . In 2002 , the Colorado Historical Society ( now History Colorado ) , authorized by the Colorado General Assembly , added an additional plaque to the monument , which states that the original designers of the monument `` mischaracterized '' Sand Creek by calling it a battle .
