The plateaus and mountains of Kurdistan , which are characterized by heavy rain and snow fall , act as a water reservoir for the Near and Middle East , forming the source of the Tigris and Euphrates rivers , as well as other numerous smaller rivers , such as the Little Khabur , Khabur , Tharthar , Ceyhan , Araxes , Kura , Sefidrud , Karkha , and Hezil . Among rivers of historical importance to Kurds are the Murat ( Arasān ) and Buhtān rivers in Turkey ; the Peshkhābur , the Little Zab , the Great Zab , and the Diyala in Iraq ; and the Jaghatu ( Zarrinarud ) , the Tātā'u ( Siminarud ) , the Zohāb ( Zahāb ) , and the Gāmāsiyāb in Iran .
