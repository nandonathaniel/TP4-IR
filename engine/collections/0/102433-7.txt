Not long after the novel 's appearance , a number of contemporary commentators noticed that the biography , appearance , writing style , and political thought of Emmanuel Goldstein resembled that of Leon Trotsky . Born Lev Bronshtein , Trotsky was a close associate of Russian revolutionary Lenin and later the chief rival of Stalin , the latter branding Trotsky a traitor and expelling him from the Soviet Union in 1927 . In exile , Trotsky wrote The Revolution Betrayed , denouncing Stalin and the Soviet Union . During the Great Purges of the 1930s , Stalin 's propaganda invariably depicted Trotsky as the instigator of all supposed plots and acts of sabotage . In 1940 , he was murdered in Mexico by Ram√≥n Mercader , a Stalinist agent .
