Traditionally , a married woman keeps her name unchanged , without adopting her husband 's surname . A child would inherit his / her father 's surname . This is still the norm in mainland China , though the marriage law explicitly states that a child may use either parent 's surname . It is also possible , though far less common , for a child to combine both parents ' surnames . Due to Western influence , some areas of greater China , such as Hong Kong and Macau , have also adopted the tradition of women changing their last name , or prepending their husband 's to her own .
