The design of a federally - supported residential school system relied on the expert advice of several prominent Canadian and British statesmen . Sir Peregrine Maitland , a British soldier and colonial administrator , first proposed boarding schools in 1820 , believing that civilizing Indigenous children , rather than adults , was the best way to influence cultural change . Residential schools focused on imparting industry and knowledge were proposed again in 1845 in a report that had been commissioned by Governor General Charles Bagot , entitled Report on the affairs of the Indians in Canada . Referred to as the Bagot Report , it is seen as the foundational document for the federal residential school system . It was supported by James Bruce , 8th Earl of Elgin , who had been impressed by industrial schools in the West Indies , and Egerton Ryerson , who was then the Chief Superintendent of Education in Upper Canada .
