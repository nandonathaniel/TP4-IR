The book contains many references to real people and events in Plath 's life . Plath 's real - life magazine scholarship was at Mademoiselle magazine beginning in 1953 . Furthermore , Philomena Guinea is based on Plath 's own patron , author Olive Higgins Prouty , who funded Plath 's scholarship to study at Smith College . Plath was rejected from a Harvard course taught by Frank O'Connor . Dr. Nolan is thought to be based on Plath 's own therapist , Ruth Beuscher , whom she continued seeing after her release from the hospital . A good portion of this part of the novel closely resembles the experiences chronicled by Mary Jane Ward in her autobiographical novel The Snake Pit ; Plath later stated that she had seen reviews of The Snake Pit and believed the public wanted to see `` mental health stuff , '' so she deliberately based details of Esther 's hospitalization on the procedures and methods outlined in Ward 's book . Plath was a patient at McLean Hospital , an upscale facility which resembled the `` snake pit '' much less than certain wards in the Metropolitan State Hospital , which may have been where Mary Jane Ward was actually hospitalized .
