Violent crime was not responsible for the quadrupling of the incarcerated population in the United States from 1980 to 2003 . Violent crime rates had been relatively constant or declining over those decades . The prison population was increased primarily by public policy changes causing more prison sentences and lengthening time served , e.g. through mandatory minimum sentencing , `` three strikes '' laws , and reductions in the availability of parole or early release . 49 percent of sentenced state inmates were held for violent offenses .
