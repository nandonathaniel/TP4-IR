I went round his house . We went to the basement and I guess they was showin ' off ' cos I was there . There 'd be RZA and his brother Devon on the decks . RZA was cuttin ' , Devon 'd go cut off the light , then RZA 's go cut on the light , Devon 'd be cutting , then he 'd go cut off the light . They was doing some wild shit , man . And Ol ' Dirty was there and he 'd echo every rhyme of RZA 's while beatboxing , ' cos that was in style then . That was the beginning of Wu - Tang .
