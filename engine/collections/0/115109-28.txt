New skins and cosmetic items were added to the event , along with the items from the previous Halloween Terror . With the exclusion of the tombstone victory poses introduced in the previous event , all these could be obtained from loot boxes or in - game coin purchase . Blizzard opted to remove the tombstone victory poses from loot box rewards as they believed these no longer fit with the characters ' personalities , but still allowed players to purchase them in - game .
