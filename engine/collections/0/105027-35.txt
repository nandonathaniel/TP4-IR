The Adventurers convened , again , a year later . This time they succeeded , and on 31 December 1600 , the Queen granted a Royal Charter to `` George , Earl of Cumberland , and 215 Knights , Aldermen , and Burgesses '' under the name , Governor and Company of Merchants of London trading with the East Indies . For a period of fifteen years , the charter awarded the newly formed company a monopoly on trade with all countries east of the Cape of Good Hope and west of the Straits of Magellan . Any traders , in breach of the charter without a licence from the company , were liable to forfeiture of their ships and cargo ( half of which went to the Crown and the other half to the company ) , as well as imprisonment at the `` royal pleasure '' .
