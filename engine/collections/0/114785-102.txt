The so - called `` Alexander Sarcophagus '' , discovered near Sidon and now in the Istanbul Archaeology Museum , is so named not because it was thought to have contained Alexander 's remains , but because its bas - reliefs depict Alexander and his companions fighting the Persians and hunting . It was originally thought to have been the sarcophagus of Abdalonymus ( died 311 BC ) , the king of Sidon appointed by Alexander immediately following the battle of Issus in 331 . However , more recently , it has been suggested that it may date from earlier than Abdalonymus ' death .
