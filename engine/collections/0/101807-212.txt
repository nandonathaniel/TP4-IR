On 22 March 1421 Henry V 's progress in his French campaign experienced an unexpected reverse . Henry had left his brother and presumptive heir Thomas , Duke of Clarence in charge while he returned to England . Clarence engaged a Franco - Scottish force of 5000 men , led by Gilbert Motier de La Fayette and John Stewart , Earl of Buchan at the Battle of Baugé . Clarence , against the advice of his lieutenants , before his army had been fully assembled , attacked with a force of no more than 1500 men - at - arms . He then , during the course of the battle , led a charge of a few hundred men into the main body of the Franco - Scottish army , who quickly enveloped the English . In the ensuing melée , the Scot , John Carmichael of Douglasdale , broke his lance unhorsing the Duke of Clarence . Once on the ground , the duke was slain by Alexander Buchanan . The body of the Duke of Clarence was recovered from the field by Thomas Montacute , 4th Earl of Salisbury , who conducted the English retreat .
