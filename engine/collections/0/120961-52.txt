`` From the Battle of Trenton to the Argonne , Marines have won foremost honors in war , and in the long eras of tranquility at home , generation after generation of Marines have grown gray in war in both hemispheres and in every corner of the seven seas , that our country and its citizens might enjoy peace and security . '' -- John A. Lejeune , Marine Corps Birthday Message , Marine Corps Order No. 47 , 1 November 1921 ( 6 October 2006 - 7 November 2006 )
