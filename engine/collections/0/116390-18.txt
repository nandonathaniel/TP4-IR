Most of Telltale 's products are adventure games based on licensed properties from film , comics , television , and other video games . Their initial games followed more traditional adventure game approaches with the player solving puzzles to progress . Their critical breakout title , The Walking Dead , based on the comic book series of the same name , introduced a more narrative - directed approach , giving the player the ability to make choices that may affect how future events in the game or its sequels play out , effectively allowing players to craft their own personalized take on the offered story ; all of Telltale 's games since have featured this player choice - driven approach .
