Many mechanical aids to calculation and measurement were constructed for astronomical and navigation use . The planisphere was a star chart invented by Abū Rayhān al - Bīrūnī in the early 11th century . The astrolabe was invented in the Hellenistic world in either the 1st or 2nd centuries BC and is often attributed to Hipparchus . A combination of the planisphere and dioptra , the astrolabe was effectively an analog computer capable of working out several different kinds of problems in spherical astronomy . An astrolabe incorporating a mechanical calendar computer and gear - wheels was invented by Abi Bakr of Isfahan , Persia in 1235 . Abū Rayhān al - Bīrūnī invented the first mechanical geared lunisolar calendar astrolabe , an early fixed - wired knowledge processing machine with a gear train and gear - wheels , circa 1000 AD .
