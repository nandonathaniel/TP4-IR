Banana bunchy top virus ( BBTV ) jumps from plant to plant using aphids . It stunts leaves , resulting in a `` bunched '' appearance . Generally , an infected plant does not produce fruit , although mild strains exist which allow some production . These mild strains are often mistaken for malnourishment , or a disease other than BBTV . There is no cure ; however , its effect can be minimized by planting only tissue - cultured plants ( in vitro propagation ) , controlling aphids , and immediately removing and destroying infected plants .
