Beginning in 1997 and continuing into the mid 2000s , Southeast Asian and Indian fashion began to influence and gain greater recognition from the global media due to the establishment of the Fashion Design Council of India , and the hosting of India Fashion Week in Delhi . Inspired by Bollywood cinema and a resurgence of interest in 1970s fashion , designers in India adapted and repurposed the saree , churidar and kurta into the Anarkali ballgown from the early 1990s onwards . By the late 1990s , kurta tunics were turned into short dresses , and Manish Arora designed garish Hindu `` God printed T - shirts '' for both locals and global tourists . British , Asian and American designers also incorporated ethnic chic fabrics , such as khadi , paisley , silk or Indonesian Batik into Western - inspired clothing patterns such as shirts and blouses featuring traditional embroidery . This type of clothing was worn not only by the immigrant Bangladeshi , Pakistani and Indian diaspora in Britain , but also by many non-Indian women .
