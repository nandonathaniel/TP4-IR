This category comprises not only paintings that depicted historical events of the past , but also paintings that showed biblical , mythological , literary and allegorical scenes . Recent historical events essentially fell out of the category , and were treated in a realist fashion , as the appropriate combination of portraits with marine , townscape or landscape subjects . Large dramatic historical or Biblical scenes were produced less frequently than in other countries , as there was no local market for church art , and few large aristocratic Baroque houses to fill . More than that , the Protestant population of major cities had been exposed to some remarkably hypocritical uses of Mannerist allegory in unsuccessful Habsburg propaganda during the Dutch Revolt , which had produced a strong reaction towards realism and a distrust of grandiose visual rhetoric . History painting was now a `` minority art '' , although to an extent this was redressed by a relatively keen interest in print versions of history subjects
