`` Mommy Track '' is a term used to describe women who simply disregard their career and professional duties in order to satisfy the needs of their families . Women are often subject to long work hours that creates an imbalance within the work - family schedule . There is research suggesting that women were able to function on a part - time professional schedule compared to others who worked full - time while still engaged in external family activities . The research also suggests , flexible work arrangements allow for the achievement of a healthy work and family balance . A difference has also been discovered in the cost and amount of effort in childbearing amongst women in higher skilled positions and roles , as opposed to women in lower - skilled jobs . This difference leads to women delaying and postponing goals and career aspirations over a number of years . A large number of women across the country who have vocational / professional certifications and degrees have been found to be not a part of the working force at the estimated rate more than twice times as male counterparts . Also , the Deloitte Touche , a professional hiring service firm , confirmed that they had recorded dropout rates in each entering class of hires and reported that indeed women 's rates were very high compared to males due to mother - and family - related responsibilities .
