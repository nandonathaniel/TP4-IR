The firearms amnesty was the first national amnesty since the 1996 Port Arthur massacre . An individual could apply to register a firearm if they are a holder of a firearms licence , or may temporarily surrender the firearm whilst applying for a firearms licence and depending on the jurisdiction may have been able to sell the firearm to a licensed firearms dealer ( a private sale not a government sponsored buy - back as in 1996 ) . However , an individual was unable to transfer ownership of the firearm to a friend or family member who holds a firearms licence for them to register . A total of 51,000 firearms were handed in during the amnesty .
