All cells , whether prokaryotic or eukaryotic , have a membrane , which envelops the cell , separates its interior from its environment , regulates what moves in and out , and maintains the electric potential of the cell . Inside the membrane , a salty cytoplasm takes up most of the cell volume . All cells possess DNA , the hereditary material of genes , and RNA , containing the information necessary to build various proteins such as enzymes , the cell 's primary machinery . There are also other kinds of biomolecules in cells .
