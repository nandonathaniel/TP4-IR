The ride is scored from 0 -- 100 points . Both the rider and the bull are awarded points . There are usually two judges , each judge scoring the bull from 0 -- 50 points , and the rider from 0 -- 50 points . The combined point totals from both judges make up the final score for the ride . This system was spearheaded by former PRCA president Dale Smith . Scores of zero are quite common as many riders lose control of the animal almost immediately after the bull leaves the bucking chute . Many experienced professionals are able to earn scores of 75 or more . Scores above 80 are considered excellent , and a score in the 90s exceptional .
