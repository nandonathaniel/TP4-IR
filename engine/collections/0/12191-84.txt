The Sudetenland was a predominantly German region inside Czechoslovakia alongside its border with Germany . Its more than 3 million ethnic Germans comprised almost a quarter of the population of Czechoslovakia . In the Treaty of Versailles it was given to the new Czechoslovak state against the wishes of much of the local population . The decision to disregard their right to self determination was based on French intent to weaken Germany . Much of Sudetenland was industrialized .
