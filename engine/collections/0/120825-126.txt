Researchers Zanna Clay and Frans de Waal studied the socio - emotional development of the bonobo chimpanzee . They focused on the interplay of numerous skills such as empathy - related responding , and how different rearing backgrounds of the juvenile bonobo affected their response to stressful events , related to themselves ( loss of a fight ) and of stressful events of others . It was found that the bonobos sought out body contact as a coping mechanism with one another . A finding of this study was that the bonobos sought out more body contact after watching a distressing event upon the other bonobos rather than their individually experienced stressful event . Mother - reared bonobos as opposed to orphaned bonobos sought out more physical contact after a stressful event happened to another . This finding shows the importance of mother - child attachment and bonding , and how it may be crucial to successful socio - emotional development , such as empathic - like behaviors .
