The space segment consists of multiple communication satellites which broadcast the correction messages generated by the WAAS Master Stations for reception by the user segment . The satellites also broadcast the same type of range information as normal GPS satellites , effectively increasing the number of satellites available for a position fix . The space segment consists of three commercial satellites : Inmarsat - 4 F3 , Telesat 's Anik F1R , and Intelsat 's Galaxy 15 . A fourth satellite , Eutelsat 117 West B , is currently in testing and is scheduled to go live in 2018 .
