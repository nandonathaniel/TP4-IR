To complete the circle , one needs to understand that when a mortgagor fails to pay an installment when due , and the mortgagee accelerates the mortgage , requiring immediate repayment of the entire mortgage indebtedness , the mortgagor does not have a right to pay the past - due installment ( s ) and have the mortgage reinstated . In Graf v. Hope Building Corp. , the New York Court of Appeals observed that in such a case , there was no forfeiture , only the operation of a clause fair on its face , to which the mortgagor had freely assented . In the latter 20th Century , New York 's lower courts eroded the Graf doctrine to such a degree that it appears that it is no longer the law , and that a court of conscience has the power to mandate that a default be excused if it is equitable to do so . Of course , now that the pendulum is swinging in the opposite direction , we can expect courts to explain where the limits on the newly expanded equity of redemption lie ... and it is probably not a coincidence that the cases that have eroded Graf v. Hope Building Corp. have been accompanied by the rise of arbitration as a means for enforcing mortgages .
