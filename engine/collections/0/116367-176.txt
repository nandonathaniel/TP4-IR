In a two - part episode from the seventh season , the original Arnold 's Drive - In was written out of the series as being destroyed by fire ( see List of Happy Days episodes , episodes 159 and 160 ) . In the last seasons that covered the 60s timeline , a new Arnold 's Drive - In set ( to portray the new Arnold 's that replaced the original Arnold 's destroyed by the fire ) emerged in a 60s decor with wood paneling and stained glass .
