William Dudley Pelley , founder of the anti-Semitic organization the Silver Legion of America , believed that Jews controlled the movie industry , which he thought to be the `` most effective propaganda medium in America '' , during the 1930s . Hence he applauded the fact that Breen had assumed the power to censor Hollywood . Breen , who also expressed anti-Semitic views , was deeply worried that Jewish filmmakers would try to use Nazi mistreatment of Jews during the 1930s as a vehicle for propaganda . He was concerned that Germans would be offended by harsh depiction of Nazis . He specifically warned Hollywood producers to avoid the topic altogether , saying that `` ( t ) here is a strong pro-German and anti-Semitic feeling in this country ... and while those who are likely to approve of an anti-Hitler picture may think well of such an enterprise , they should keep in mind that millions of Americans might think otherwise . '' Breen claimed that plans to make such pictures were being coordinated through the Hollywood Anti-Nazi League , which he claimed was `` conducted and financed almost entirely by Jews '' . As a result of Breen 's anticommunist views , the censorship board pressured Metro - Goldwyn - Mayer to drop plans to film Sinclair Lewis 's anti-fascist novel , It Ca n't Happen Here .
