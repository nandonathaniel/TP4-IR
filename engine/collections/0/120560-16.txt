Historian Carl Bridenbaugh examined in depth five key cities : Boston ( population 16,000 in 1760 ) , Newport Rhode Island ( population 7500 ) , New York City ( population 18,000 ) , Philadelphia ( population 23,000 ) , and Charles Town ( Charlestown , South Carolina ) , ( population 8000 ) . He argues they grew from small villages to take major leadership roles in promoting trade , land speculation , immigration , and prosperity , and in disseminating the ideas of the Enlightenment , and new methods in medicine and technology . Furthermore , they sponsored a consumer taste for English amenities , developed a distinctly American educational system , and began systems for care of people meeting welfare . The cities were not remarkable by European standards , but they did display certain distinctly American characteristics , according to Bridenbaugh . There was no aristocracy or established church , there was no long tradition of powerful guilds . The colonial governments were much less powerful and intrusive than corresponding national governments in Europe . They experimented with new methods to raise revenue , build infrastructure , and solve urban problems . They were more democratic than European cities , in that a large fraction of the men could vote , and class lines were more fluid . Contrasted to Europe , printers ( especially as newspaper editors ) had a much larger role in shaping public opinion , and lawyers moved easily back and forth between politics and their profession . Bridenbaugh argues that by the mid-18th century , the middle - class businessmen , professionals , and skilled artisans dominated the cities . He characterizes them as `` sensible , shrewd , frugal , ostentatiously moral , generally honest , '' public spirited , and upwardly mobile , and argues their economic strivings led to `` democratic yearnings '' for political power .
