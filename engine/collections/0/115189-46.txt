First , just war must be waged by a properly instituted authority such as the state . ( Proper Authority is first : represents the common good : which is peace for the sake of man 's true end -- God . ) Second , war must occur for a good and just purpose rather than for self - gain ( for example , `` in the nation 's interest '' is not just ) or as an exercise of power ( just cause : for the sake of restoring some good that has been denied . i.e. lost territory , lost goods , punishment for an evil perpetrated by a government , army , or even the civilian populace ) . Third , peace must be a central motive even in the midst of violence . ( right intention : an authority must fight for the just reasons it has expressly claimed for declaring war in the first place . Soldiers must also fight for this intention ) .
