In 1932 , Democratic presidential nominee Franklin D. Roosevelt promised `` a New Deal for the American people '' , coining the enduring label for his domestic policies . The desperate economic situation , along with the substantial Democratic victories in the 1932 elections , gave Roosevelt unusual influence over Congress in the `` First Hundred Days '' of his administration . He used his leverage to win rapid passage of a series of measures to create welfare programs and regulate the banking system , stock market , industry , and agriculture , along with many other government efforts to end the Great Depression and reform the American economy . The New Deal regulated much of the economy , especially the financial sector . It provided relief to the unemployed through numerous programs , such as the Works Progress Administration ( WPA ) and for young men , the Civilian Conservation Corps that undertook jobs such as forest fire fighting and creating public works . Large scale spending projects designed to provide high paying jobs and rebuild the infrastructure were under the purview of the Public Works Administration . Roosevelt turned left in 1935 -- 36 , building up labor unions through the Wagner Act . Unions became a powerful element of the merging New Deal Coalition , which won reelection for Roosevelt in 1936 , 1940 , and 1944 by mobilizing union members , blue collar workers , relief recipients , big city machines , ethnic , and religious groups ( especially Catholics and Jews ) and the white South , along with blacks in the North ( where they could vote ) . Some of the programs were dropped in the 1940s when the conservatives regained power in Congress through the Conservative Coalition . Of special importance is the Social Security program , begun in 1935 .
