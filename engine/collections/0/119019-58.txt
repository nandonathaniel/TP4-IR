The method of financing the Midtown Hudson Tunnel was revised in late 1935 . Originally , the Port Authority had advertised $34.3 million in bonds at a 4 % interest rate , with the first issue of bonds set to mature in 1975 . In November , the PWA announced that it would change the $37.5 million loan to a $4.78 million grant once the Port Authority had sold the PWA $22.3 million in bonds . The rest of the outstanding balance , approximately $10.4 million , was to be raised privately , and the Port Authority would have raised $32.7 million in bonds by the time the grant was awarded . The next month , the Port Authority awarded a $16.5 million bond issue at ​ 3 ⁄ % interest rate . The PWA advanced the grant to the Port Authority in January 1936 .
