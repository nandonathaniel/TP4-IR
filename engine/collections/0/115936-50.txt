Drainage systems on buildings in 17th - century Europe were poor , and may have disgorged their contents during heavy showers , including the corpses of any animals that had accumulated in them . This occurrence is documented in Jonathan Swift 's 1710 poem ' Description of a City Shower ' , in which he describes `` Drowned puppies , stinking sprats , all drenched in mud , / Dead cats and turnip - tops come tumbling down the flood .
