In February 2017 , advertising for the show sparked criticism in Germany , where Netflix promoted the show with posters depicting a human finger sliced up like a currywurst , a popular German fast food dish . After receiving more than 50 complaints that the advertising was glorifying violence and inducing fear , especially in children , the German Advertising Council , a self - regulatory institution , forwarded the complaints to the company . Netflix then decided to end the campaign and remove all posters .
