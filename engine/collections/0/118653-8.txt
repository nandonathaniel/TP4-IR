Experimental studies of simulated lightning have produced results largely consistent with this model , though there is continued debate about the precise physical mechanisms of the process . Other causes have also been proposed , relying on electrodynamic effects of the massive current acting on the plasma in the bolt of lightning . The shockwave in thunder is sufficient to cause injury , such as internal contusion , to individuals nearby .
