A new design for one pound notes was introduced in 1960 , with the old notes ceasing to be legal tender in 1962 . These new series C notes were slightly narrower , and were the first one - pound notes to feature a portrait of Queen Elizabeth II on the front . The reverse design incorporated the logo of the Bank of England . Series C notes were replaced by the series D notes from 1978 onward . These slightly smaller notes featured an entirely new design with Queen Elizabeth II on the front and scientist Isaac Newton on the back . The note was redesigned slightly in 1981 to feature brighter background colours . Following a consultation with retailers and other groups it was announced on 31 July 1981 that the one pound note would be replaced by a one pound coin . Part of the reason for this change was that notes , on average , lasted only nine months in general circulation , while coins could last forty years or more . The government also believed that the growing vending industry would benefit from the introduction of a one - pound coin . The new cupro - nickel coin was introduced on 21 April 1983 and the one pound note ceased to be legal tender on 11 March 1988 .
