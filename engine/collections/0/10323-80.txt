The scheduling formula before 1995 was very similar , except in a modified format to fit not having fully balanced divisions . During these years , teams in five - team divisions who did not finish last would not normally face a 5th place team outside their division , whether or not those teams were intraconference . There was a special so - called `` last place '' or `` fifth - place '' schedule for teams who finished in last place in a five - team division . In addition to their division games , a team who finished in last place in the previous season would also primarily play the other teams who finished in last place in their respective divisions ( the intraconference one would be played twice to fill a void otherwise taken by a third team that finished the same place ) , plus all the clubs in the four team division in their conference . An example of this is also shown to the right . The teams in a four - team division played only six divisional games , as opposed to the eight that teams in five - team divisions had played . This void would be filled by having to play against the 5th place teams in their conference in addition to their regular scheduling , hence tying to the `` fifth - place '' schedule .
