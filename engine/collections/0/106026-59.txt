Evidence that Mars once had enough water to create a global ocean at least 137 m deep has been obtained from measurement of the HDO to H O ratio over the north polar cap . In March 2015 , a team of scientists published results showing that the polar cap ice is about eight times as enriched with deuterium , heavy hydrogen , as water in Earth 's oceans . This means that Mars has lost a volume of water 6.5 times as large as that stored in today 's polar caps . The water for a time may have formed an ocean in the low - lying Vastitas Borealis and adjacent lowlands ( Acidalia , Arcadia and Utopia planitiae ) . Had the water ever all been liquid and on the surface , it would have covered 20 % of the planet and in places would have been almost a mile deep .
