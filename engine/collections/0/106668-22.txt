In contrast , in six federal judicial circuits and the majority of nonjudicial foreclosure states ( like California ) , due process has already been judicially determined to be a frivolous defense . The entire point of nonjudicial foreclosure is that there is no state actor ( i.e. , a court ) involved . The constitutional right of due process protects people only from violations of their civil rights by state actors , not private actors . ( The involvement of the county clerk or recorder in recording the necessary documents has been held to be insufficient to invoke due process , since they are required by statute to record all documents presented that meet minimum formatting requirements and are denied the discretion to decide whether a particular foreclosure should proceed . )
