On November 3 , 2008 , the Redskins wore burgundy jerseys over their burgundy pants in a Monday night home game against the Pittsburgh Steelers the night before the 2008 U.S. Presidential election . The Redskins lost the game , 23 -- 6 . It was the first time the Redskins went with the dark `` monochrome '' look that many NFL teams have adopted in some form over the past few years . This uniform combination made a reappearance in 2009 against the Dallas Cowboys at Cowboys Stadium on November 22 and a home Monday night game against the New York Giants on December 21 .
