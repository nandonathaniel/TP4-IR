Czech has one of the most phonemic orthographies of all European languages . Its thirty - one graphemes represent thirty sounds ( in most dialects , i and y have the same sound ) , and it contains only one digraph : ch , which follows h in the alphabet . As a result , some of its characters have been used by phonologists to denote corresponding sounds in other languages . The characters q , w and x appear only in foreign words . The háček ( ˇ ) is used with certain letters to form new characters : š , ž , and č , as well as ň , ě , ř , ť , and ď ( the latter five uncommon outside Czech ) . The last two letters are sometimes written with a comma above ( ʼ , an abbreviated háček ) because of their height . The character ó exists only in loanwords and onomatopoeia .
