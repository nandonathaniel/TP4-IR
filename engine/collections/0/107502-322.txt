Valentine also experimented on his children . Hoping to make a stronger and better Shadowhunter , he infused Jonathan with demon blood while in Jocelyn 's womb . However , a side effect of the blood was that it would `` burn out his ( Jonathan 's ) humanity as poison burns the life from blood . '' This gave him a son capable of incredible feats , but with little to no compassion or ability to love . The experimentation on Jonathan led to Jocelyn feeling sick and very depressed . To make her feel better he gave her powdered Angel blood , not knowing that she was carrying a second child ( Clary ) , infusing Clary with Angel blood in the same way that Jonathan was with Demon blood . With Jace , upon the failure of Jonathan to show any compassion , he gave Angel blood to Jace 's mother ( Celin√© Herondale ) , hoping to create a stronger warrior , without the side effects Jonathan suffered from the use Demon blood . In the end , Valentine trained Jace , but was forced to abandon him when he was 10 years old , making Valentine the only father Jace has known . It is also thought that of the two boys , the angel and the demon , that Valentine loved Jace more than his own son .
