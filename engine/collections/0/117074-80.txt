Joseph Alan Fennell 's argument -- that the compensation he received in exchange for `` non-federally privileged private sector labor '' was not taxable -- was rejected by the United States Tax Court . Fennell appealed his Tax Court loss , but the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ruled that Fennell 's challenges were `` frivolous on the merits in any event . '' Similarly , in United States v. Buras , the argument that the taxpayer can be subject to the federal income tax only if he benefits from a `` privilege extended by a government agency '' was ruled to be without merit .
