In addition , the Chow test is used to test whether two subsamples both have the same underlying true coefficient values . The sum of squared residuals of regressions on each of the subsets and on the combined data set are compared by computing an F - statistic ; if this exceeds a critical value , the null hypothesis of no difference between the two subsets is rejected ; otherwise , it is accepted .
