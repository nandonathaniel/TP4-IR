The Greeks thus decided very early on that the human form was the most important subject for artistic endeavour . Seeing their gods as having human form , there was no distinction between the sacred and the secular in art -- the human body was both secular and sacred . A male nude without any attachments such as a bow or a club , could just as easily be Apollo or Heracles as that year 's Olympic boxing champion . In the Archaic Period the most important sculptural form was the kouros ( plural kouroi ) , the standing male nude ( See for example Biton and Kleobis ) . The kore ( plural korai ) , or standing clothed female figure , was also common ; Greek art did not present female nudity ( unless the intention was pornographic ) until the 4th century BC , although the development of techniques to represent drapery is obviously important .
