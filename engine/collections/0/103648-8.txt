Little House in the Big Woods describes the homesteading skills Laura observed and began to practice during her fifth year . The cousins come for Christmas that year , and Laura receives a doll , which she names Charlotte . Later that winter , the family goes to Grandma Ingalls 's and has a `` sugaring off '' . The family and neighbors harvest sap and make maple syrup . The Ingalls family returns home with buckets of syrup , enough to last the year . Laura remembered that sugaring off , and the dance that followed , for the rest of her life .
