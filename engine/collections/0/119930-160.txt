Over the years , other styles of artificial Christmas trees have evolved and become popular . In 1930 , the U.S. - based Addis Brush Company created the first artificial Christmas tree made from brush bristles . Another type of artificial tree is the aluminum Christmas tree , first manufactured in Chicago in 1958 , and later in Manitowoc , Wisconsin , where the majority of the trees were produced . Most modern artificial Christmas trees are made from plastic recycled from used packaging materials , such as polyvinyl chloride ( PVC ) . Approximately 10 % of artificial Christmas trees are using virgin suspension PVC resin ; despite being plastic most artificial trees are not recyclable or biodegradable .
