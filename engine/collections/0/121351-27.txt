The inclusion of Myanmar in South Asia is without consensus , with many considering it a part of Southeast Asia and others including it within South Asia . Afghanistan was of importance to the British colonial empire , especially after the Second Anglo - Afghan War over 1878 -- 1880 . Afghanistan remained a British protectorate until 1919 , when a treaty with Vladimir Lenin included the granting of independence to Afghanistan . Following India 's partition , Afghanistan has generally been included in South Asia , with some considering it a part of Southwest Asia . During the Soviet war in Afghanistan ( 1979 -- 1989 ) American foreign policy considered Pakistan and Afghanistan in Southwest Asia , while others included it as a part of South Asia . There is no universal agreement among scholars on which countries should be included within South Asia .
