During the Seven Years ' War , Cook served in North America as master aboard the fourth - rate Navy vessel HMS Pembroke . With others in Pembroke 's crew , he took part in the major amphibious assault that captured the Fortress of Louisbourg from the French in 1758 , and in the siege of Quebec City in 1759 . Throughout his service he demonstrated a talent for surveying and cartography , and was responsible for mapping much of the entrance to the Saint Lawrence River during the siege , thus allowing General Wolfe to make his famous stealth attack during the 1759 Battle of the Plains of Abraham .
