Having found a place in India 's Test squad for the tour of Australia in December 2011 , Kohli top - scored with 132 in a tour match against Cricket Australia Chairman 's XI to strengthen his case for a spot in the playing eleven ahead of Rohit Sharma . Batting at number 6 , Kohli failed to go past 25 in the first two Tests as his defensive technique was exposed . While fielding on the boundary during the second day of the second match , he gestured to the crowd with his middle finger for which he was fined 50 % of his match fee by the match referee . He top - scored in each of India 's innings in the third Test at Perth , with 44 and 75 , even as India surrendered to their second consecutive innings defeat . In the fourth and final match at Adelaide , Kohli scored his maiden Test century of 116 runs in the first innings ; it was the only century scored by an Indian in the series . India suffered a 0 -- 4 whitewash and Kohli , India 's top run - scorer in the series , was described as `` the lone bright spot in an otherwise nightmare visit for the tourists '' .
