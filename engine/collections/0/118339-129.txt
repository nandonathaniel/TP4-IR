There are no direct flights to USA or Canada , although there have been flights Kangerlussuaq -- Baltimore , and Nuuk -- Iqaluit. , which were cancelled because of too few passengers and financial losses . An alternative between Greenland and USA / Canada is Air Iceland / Icelandair with a plane change in Iceland .
