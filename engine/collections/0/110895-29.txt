Research published in 2013 shows that the US provides , alongside the United Kingdom and Spain , the least economic mobility of any of 13 rich , democratic countries in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development . Prior research suggested that the United States shows roughly average levels of occupational upward mobility and shows lower rates of income mobility than comparable societies . Blanden et al. report , `` the idea of the US as ' the land of opportunity ' persists ; and clearly seems misplaced . '' According to these studies , `` by international standards , the United States has an unusually low level of intergenerational mobility : our parents ' income is highly predictive of our incomes as adults . Intergenerational mobility in the United States is lower than in France , Germany , Sweden , Canada , Finland , Norway and Denmark . Research in 2006 found that among high - income countries for which comparable estimates are available , only the United Kingdom had a lower rate of mobility than the United States . '' Economist Isabel Sawhill concluded that `` this challenges the notion of America as the land of opportunity '' . Several public figures and commentators , from David Frum to Richard G. Wilkinson , have noted that the American dream is better realized in Denmark , which is ranked as having the highest social mobility in the OECD . In 2015 , economist Joseph Stiglitz stated , `` Maybe we should be calling the American Dream the Scandinavian Dream . ''
