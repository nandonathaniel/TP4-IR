In accordance with magnetic data , electrical resistivity of curium increases with temperature -- about twice between 4 and 60 K -- and then remains nearly constant up to room temperature . There is a significant increase in resistivity over time ( about 10 μΩ cm / h ) due to self - damage of the crystal lattice by alpha radiation . This makes uncertain the absolute resistivity value for curium ( about 125 μΩ cm ) . The resistivity of curium is similar to that of gadolinium and of the actinides plutonium and neptunium , but is significantly higher than that of americium , uranium , polonium and thorium .
