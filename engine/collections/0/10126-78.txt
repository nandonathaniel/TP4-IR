Following the 1959 Cuban Revolution and the local implementation in several countries of Che Guevara 's foco theory , the US waged a war in South America against what it called `` Communist subversives '' , leading to support of coups against democratically elected presidents such as the backing of the Chilean right wing , which would culminate with Augusto Pinochet 's 1973 Chilean coup against democratically - elected Salvador Allende . By 1976 , all of South America was covered by similar military dictatorships , called juntas . In Paraguay , Alfredo Stroessner had been in power since 1954 ; in Brazil , left - wing President João Goulart was overthrown by a military coup in 1964 with the assistance of the US in what was known as Operation Brother Sam ; in Bolivia , General Hugo Banzer overthrew leftist General Juan José Torres in 1971 ; in Uruguay , considered the `` Switzerland '' of South America , Juan María Bordaberry seized power in the 27 June 1973 coup . In Peru , leftist General Velasco Alvarado in power since 1968 , planned to use the recently empowered Peruvian military to overwhelm Chilean armed forces in a planned invasion of Pinochetist Chile . A `` Dirty War '' was waged all over the subcontinent , culminating with Operation Condor , an agreement between security services of the Southern Cone and other South American countries to repress and assassinate political opponents , which was backed by the US government . The armed forces also took power in Argentina in 1976 , and then supported the 1980 `` Cocaine Coup '' of Luis García Meza Tejada in Bolivia , before training the `` Contras '' in Nicaragua , where the Sandinista National Liberation Front , headed by Daniel Ortega , had taken power in 1979 , as well as militaries in Guatemala and in El Salvador . In the frame of Operation Charly , supported by the US , the Argentine military exported state terror tactics to Central America , where the `` dirty war '' was waged until well into the 1990s , making hundreds of thousands `` disappeared '' .
