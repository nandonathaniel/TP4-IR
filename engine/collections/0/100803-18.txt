`` Let them produce the original records of their churches ; let them unfold the roll of their bishops , running down in due succession from the beginning in such a manner that ( that first bishop of theirs ) bishop shall be able to show for his ordainer and predecessor some one of the apostles or of apostolic men '' -- Tertullian
