`` Infinity bottles of beer on the wall '' . If one bottle is taken down , there are still infinite bottles of beer on the wall ( thus creating an unending sequence much like `` The Song That Never Ends '' ) . `` Aleph - null bottles of beer on the wall '' . Aleph - null is the size of the set of all natural numbers , and is the smallest infinity and the only countable one ; therefore , even if an infinite aleph - null of bottles fall , the same amount remains . `` Aleph - one / two / three / etc. bottles of beer on the wall '' . Aleph - one , two , three , etc. are uncountable infinite sets , which are larger than countable ones ; therefore , if only a countable infinity of bottles fall , an uncountable number remains .
