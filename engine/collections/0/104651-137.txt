Cytoplasmic transfer is where the cytoplasm from a donor egg is injected into an egg with compromised mitochondria . The resulting egg is then fertilized with sperm and implanted in a womb , usually that of the woman who provided the recipient egg and nuclear DNA . Cytoplasmic transfer was created to aid women who experience infertility due to deficient or damaged mitochondria , contained within an egg 's cytoplasm .
