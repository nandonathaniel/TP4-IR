In the configuration commonly known as Dallas phasing that began in the Dallas / Fort Worth Metroplex , the five - light left turn signal head is used in a different manner than standard signals of this type . The left turn signal head operates independently from the signals for straight through traffic . This allows permissive turning even when straight through traffic is shown a red light , avoiding yellow trap . Louvers are fitted over the green and yellow balls of the left turn signal head to prevent driver confusion . The left turn signal head is also accompanied by a sign indicating its special use .
