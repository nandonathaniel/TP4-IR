Holy Communion . Some congregations celebrate communion on the first Sunday of the month and a few celebrate it only quarterly . A growing number of congregations celebrate the sacrament of Holy Communion on a weekly basis , as John Wesley himself encouraged his followers to practice . In adopting the statement on Holy Communion entitled This Holy Mystery in 2004 , the General Conference of the Church urged congregations to move toward weekly celebration of communion and to use the official liturgies of the church when doing so .
