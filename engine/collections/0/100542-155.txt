Lemon ants make devil 's gardens by killing surrounding plants with their stings and leaving a pure patch of lemon ant trees , ( Duroia hirsuta ) . This modification of the forest provides the ants with more nesting sites inside the stems of the Duroia trees . Although some ants obtain nectar from flowers , pollination by ants is somewhat rare . Some plants have special nectar exuding structures , extrafloral nectaries , that provide food for ants , which in turn protect the plant from more damaging herbivorous insects . Species such as the bullhorn acacia ( Acacia cornigera ) in Central America have hollow thorns that house colonies of stinging ants ( Pseudomyrmex ferruginea ) who defend the tree against insects , browsing mammals , and epiphytic vines . Isotopic labelling studies suggest that plants also obtain nitrogen from the ants . In return , the ants obtain food from protein - and lipid - rich Beltian bodies . In Fiji Philidris nagasau ( Dolichoderinae ) are known to selectively grow species of epiphytic Squamellaria ( Rubiaceae ) which produce large domatia inside which the ant colonies nest . The ants plant the seeds and the domatia of young seedling are immediately occupied and the ant faeces in them contribute to rapid growth . Similar dispersal associations are found with other dolichoderines in the region as well . Another example of this type of ectosymbiosis comes from the Macaranga tree , which has stems adapted to house colonies of Crematogaster ants .
