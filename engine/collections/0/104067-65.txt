Prior to 1 July 2006 , only a legitimate child ( born to parents who are married to each other ) could automatically derive British citizenship from the father , if the father was a British citizen or `` settled '' in the United Kingdom . However , if the parents are not married when the child is born in the United Kingdom , but then get married , and the marriage legitimates the child , then if the father was a British citizen or `` settled '' in the UK when the child was born , the child would become a British citizen and would be regarded as having been one from the date of marriage . This affects only children where the mother is neither a British citizen nor `` settled '' in the UK .
