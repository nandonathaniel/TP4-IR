Between 1754 and 1763 , many Native American tribes were involved in the French and Indian War / Seven Years ' War . Those involved in the fur trade tended to ally with French forces against British colonial militias . The British had made fewer allies , but it was joined by some tribes that wanted to prove assimilation and loyalty in support of treaties to preserve their territories . They were often disappointed when such treaties were later overturned . The tribes had their own purposes , using their alliances with the European powers to battle traditional Native enemies . Some Iroquois who were loyal to the British , and helped them fight in the American Revolution , fled north into Canada .
