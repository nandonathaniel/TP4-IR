The design specifications were completed in February 1945 , and contracts were let to build the components . Three different plants were used so that no one would have a copy of the complete design . The gun and breech were made by the Naval Gun Factory in Washington , D.C. ; the target case and some other components by the Naval Ordnance Plant in Center Line , Michigan ; and the tail fairing and mounting brackets by the Expert Tool and Die Company in Detroit , Michigan . The bomb , except for the uranium payload , was ready at the beginning of May 1945 . Manhattan District Engineer Kenneth Nichols expected on 1 May 1945 to have uranium - 235 `` for one weapon before August 1 and a second one sometime in December '' , assuming the second weapon would be a gun type ; designing an implosion bomb for uranium - 235 was considered , and this would increase the production rate . The uranium - 235 projectile was completed on 15 June , and the target on 24 July . The target and bomb pre-assemblies ( partly assembled bombs without the fissile components ) left Hunters Point Naval Shipyard , California , on 16 July aboard the heavy cruiser USS Indianapolis , arriving on 26 July . The target inserts followed by air on 30 July .
