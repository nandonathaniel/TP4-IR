Then - Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger championed a new football stadium in Anaheim in tandem with a new L.A. Coliseum in 2006 . There were reports , however , that NFL owners would not approve a return to the L.A. area until two teams committed to play in a single new stadium ( similar to the New York Giants and New York Jets , first in Giants Stadium and since 2010 in MetLife Stadium ) . In response to rising cost estimates for a new stadium , NFL commissioner Roger Goodell said that returning the NFL to Los Angeles would require the league to consider unspecified `` alternative solutions . '' In November 2007 , the then - Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa declared that the policy of requiring the NFL to relocate to the Coliseum would change and other options would be explored .
