The New Testament canon as it is now was first listed by St. Athanasius , Bishop of Alexandria , in 367 , in a letter written to his churches in Egypt , Festal Letter 39 . Also cited is the Council of Rome , but not without controversy . That canon gained wider and wider recognition until it was accepted at the Third Council of Carthage in 397 and 419 .
