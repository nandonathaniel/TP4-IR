In Furman v. Georgia , the U.S. Supreme Court considered a group of consolidated cases . The lead case involved an individual convicted under Georgia 's death penalty statute , which featured a `` unitary trial '' procedure in which the jury was asked to return a verdict of guilt or innocence and , simultaneously , determine whether the defendant would be punished by death or life imprisonment . The last pre-Furman execution was that of Luis Monge on June 2 , 1967 .
