In 1927 , under Augusto César Sandino , a major peasant uprising was launched against both the U.S. occupation and the Nicaraguan establishment . In 1933 , the Marines withdrew and left the Nicaraguan National Guard in charge of internal security and elections . In 1934 , Anastasio Somoza García , the head of the National Guard , ordered his forces to capture and murder Sandino . In 1937 , Somoza assumed the presidency , while still in control of the National Guard , and established a dictatorship that his family controlled until 1979 .
