For example , if some company has 4 million shares outstanding and the closing price per share is $20 , its market cap is then $80 million . If the closing price per share rises to $21 , the market cap becomes $84 million . If it drops to $19 per share , the market cap falls to $76 million . This is in contrast to mercantile pricing where purchase price , average price and sale price may differ due to transaction costs .
