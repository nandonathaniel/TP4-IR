On January 24 , 2000 , an elevator in the building suddenly descended 40 stories after a cable that controlled the cabin 's maximum speed was severed . The elevator fell from the 44th floor to the fourth floor , where a narrowed elevator shaft provided a second safety system . Despite the 40 - floor fall , both of the passengers in the cabin at the time were only slightly injured . Since that elevator had no fourth - floor doors , the passengers were rescued by an adjacent elevator . After the fall , building inspectors reviewed all of the building 's elevators .
