One method is to use the Prime Meridian as the dividing line between east and west . This meridian running through Greenwich , London , is defined as zero degrees longitude and could be called the least eastern and least western place in the world . The 180th meridian , on the opposite side of the globe , is therefore the easternmost and westernmost place in the world .
