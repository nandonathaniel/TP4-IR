Funnel - web spider venom contains a compound known as atracotoxin , an ion channel inhibitor , which makes the venom highly toxic for humans and other primates . However , it does not affect the nervous system of other mammals . These spiders typically deliver a full envenomation when they bite , often striking repeatedly , due to their defensiveness and large chitinous cheliceral fangs . There has been no reported case of severe envenoming by female funnel - web spiders , which is consistent with the finding that the venom of female specimens is less potent than the venom of their male counterparts . In the case of severe envenomation , the time to onset of symptoms is less than one hour , with a study about funnel - web spider bites finding a median time of 28 minutes . This same study revealed that children are at a particular risk of severe funnel - web envenoming , with 42 % of all cases of severe envenoming being children . There is at least one recorded case of a small child dying within 15 minutes of a bite from a Sydney funnel - web spider .
