Hydropower is a flexible source of electricity since stations can be ramped up and down very quickly to adapt to changing energy demands . Hydro turbines have a start - up time of the order of a few minutes . It takes around 60 to 90 seconds to bring a unit from cold start - up to full load ; this is much shorter than for gas turbines or steam plants . Power generation can also be decreased quickly when there is a surplus power generation . Hence the limited capacity of hydropower units is not generally used to produce base power except for vacating the flood pool or meeting downstream needs . Instead , it serves as backup for non-hydro generators .
