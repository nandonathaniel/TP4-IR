Originally a member of the LAPD Robbery / Homicide Division ( commanded by then - Captain Taylor ) , who sent him to `` assist '' ( sabotage ) Deputy Chief Brenda Leigh Johnson 's team . Flynn was originally antagonistic to Deputy Chief Johnson ; but , after Commander Taylor blamed him for a mishandled investigation that nearly ended his career and Brenda proved his innocence , he transferred to Deputy Chief Johnson 's team on a permanent basis and gained respect for her . He was forced further into her debt due to the mishandling of another investigation ( with Lt. Provenza ) and was forced by Deputy Chief Johnson to repay the squad for helping keep him and Provenza out of trouble with the department . In the episode `` Homewrecker '' , Flynn identifies himself in the opening crime scene video sequence as `` Andrew Flynn , PhD ( Priority Homicide Division ) . '' In the Major Crimes episode `` Risk Assessment '' , Flynn tells Rusty Beck he became a cop because he was nearly arrested for stealing a motorcycle and decided he 'd rather put criminals behind bars than end up there himself . He later tells Provenza in `` Chain Reaction '' that he thinks about retiring everyday but has given too much to the job to do it ; namely , a good relationship with his children and his faith in most of humanity .
