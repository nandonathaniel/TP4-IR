Not every case is a crime . In some cases , the investigation reveals that the suspects are innocent , and that the death was an accident or a suicide . Several shows have profiled people who have been jailed for or convicted of a crime , and who were ultimately exonerated by forensic evidence . Other episodes have focused on accidents where consulted experts relied on forensic evidence in order to explain why the incident occurred , such as the 1987 King 's Cross station fire and the 1993 Big Bayou Canot train wreck . Many of the accident investigation episodes were originally broadcast as a separate CourtTV series titled Extreme Evidence , but they are now re-run under the Forensic Files name , and are included in the Mystery Detectives re-branding .
