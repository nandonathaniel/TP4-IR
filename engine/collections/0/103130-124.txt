An exception to this is the northern tropical regions . The Kimberley has an extremely hot monsoonal climate with average annual rainfall ranging from 500 to 1,500 mm ( 20 to 59 in ) , but there is a very long almost rainless season from April to November . Eighty - five percent of the state 's runoff occurs in the Kimberley , but because it occurs in violent floods and because of the insurmountable poverty of the generally shallow soils , the only development has taken place along the Ord River .
