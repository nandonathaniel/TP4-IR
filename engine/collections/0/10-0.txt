Shortwave radio is radio transmission using shortwave radio frequencies . There is no official definition of the band , but the range always includes all of the high frequency band ( HF ) , and generally extends from 1.7 -- 30 MHz ( 176.3 -- 10.0 m ) ; from the high end of the medium frequency band ( MF ) just above the mediumwave AM broadcast band , to the end of the HF band .
