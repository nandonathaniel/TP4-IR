In the Horn region to the north , the Jubba and the Shebelle rivers begin in the Ethiopian Highlands . These rivers mainly flow southwards , with the Jubba emptying in the Indian Ocean . The Shebelle River reaches a point to the southwest . After that , it consists of swamps and dry reaches before finally disappearing in the desert terrain near the Jubba River . Another large stream , the Hawash , rising in the Ethiopian mountains , is lost in a saline depression near the Gulf of Aden .
