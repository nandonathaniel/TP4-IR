In 2007 , the National Geographic Society sponsored a contest for a new mnemonic of MVEMCJSUNPE , incorporating the then eleven known planets and dwarf planets , including Eris , Ceres , and the newly demoted Pluto . On February 22 , 2008 , My Very Exciting Magic Carpet Just Sailed Under Nine Palace Elephants , coined by 10 - year - old Maryn Smith of Great Falls , Montana , was announced as the winner . The phrase was featured in the song 11 Planets by Grammy - nominated singer and songwriter Lisa Loeb and in the book 11 Planets : A New View of the Solar System by David Aguilar ( ISBN 978 - 1426302367 ) .
