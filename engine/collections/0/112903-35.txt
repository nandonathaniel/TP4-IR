During her middle school years , IU found her passion for singing and decided to become a singer after being applauded for a performance she gave at her school 's sports competition . She attended 20 auditions but failed all of them , and was also scammed by fake entertainment companies . Before joining LOEN Entertainment in 2007 , IU trained at Good Entertainment with Uee , Yubin , Heo Ga - yoon , and Jun Hyoseong . After signing with LOEN , IU moved to Bangbae , Seoul . Despite thinking that she might eventually be put into a girl group after three to four years of training , she received ten months of training before her solo debut in 2008 . Due to her living conditions at the time , IU stated that she `` loved being at the studio '' , where she could eat as much as she wanted and had a place to sleep . Prior to her debut , LOEN coined her stage name `` IU '' , deriving it from the phrase `` I and You '' to symbolize the unifying force of music between people .
