Romanticism ( also the Romantic era or the Romantic period ) was an artistic , literary , musical and intellectual movement that originated in Europe toward the end of the 18th century , and in most areas was at its peak in the approximate period from 1800 to 1850 . Romanticism was characterized by its emphasis on emotion and individualism as well as glorification of all the past and nature , preferring the medieval rather than the classical . It was partly a reaction to the Industrial Revolution , the aristocratic social and political norms of the Age of Enlightenment , and the scientific rationalization of nature -- all components of modernity . It was embodied most strongly in the visual arts , music , and literature , but had a major impact on historiography , education , and the natural sciences . It had a significant and complex effect on politics , with romantic thinkers influencing liberalism , radicalism , conservatism and nationalism .
