Italian immigration in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century relied on a system of both chain and return migration . Chain migration helped Italian men immigrate to such cities as New York in the United States and Buenos Aires in Argentina for work as migrant laborers . Italians generally left Italy due to dire economic conditions and returned wealthy by Italian standards after working in the Americas for a number of years . Italian immigrants were called ritorni in Italy and grouped with other Southern and Eastern European migrant laborers under the term `` birds of passage '' in America . However , after the passage in the United States of the Immigration Act of 1924 , return migration was limited and led more Italians to become naturalized citizens . The networks that had been built up by information and money due to chain and return migration provided incentives for Italian permanent migration . Mexican migration to the United States from the 1940s to the 1990s followed some of the same patterns as Italian immigration .
