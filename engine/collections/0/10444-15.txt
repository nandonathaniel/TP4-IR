Carnegie made it clear that the duty of the rich was to live modest lifestyles , and that any surplus of money they had was best suited for re-circulation back into society where it could be used to support the greater good . He shunned aristocratic chains of inheritance and argued that dependents should be supported by their work with major moderation , with the bulk of excess wealth to be spent on enriching the community . In cases where excess wealth was held until death , he advocated its apprehension by the state on a progressive scale : `` Indeed , it is difficult to set bounds to the share of a rich man 's estates which should go at his death to the public through the agency of the State , and by all means such taxes should be granted , beginning at nothing upon moderate sums to dependents , and increasing rapidly as the amounts swell , until of the millionaire 's hoard , at least the other half comes to the privy coffer of the State .
