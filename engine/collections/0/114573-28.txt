Erik does so with the Persian , but Raoul was kept `` a hostage '' and was `` locked up comfortably , properly chained '' in the dungeon under the opera . When he returns , he finds Christine waiting for him , like `` a real living wife '' and he swore she tilted her forehead toward him , and he kissed it . Then he says he was so happy that he fell at her feet , crying , and she cries with him , calling him `` poor , unhappy Erik '' and taking his hand . At this point , he is `` just a poor dog ready to die for her '' and he returns to her the ring she had lost and said that she was free to go and marry Raoul .
