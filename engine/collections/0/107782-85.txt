Nilay Patel of The Verge called iPhone 8 the `` default option '' , noting that the 8 models stand as almost universally overlooked by Apple 's other new iPhone launched , iPhone X . He nevertheless praised the device 's form factor for being easy and non-slippery to hold , the display 's addition of True Tone technology and upgraded speakers , though he cited issues with charging speed through wireless pads as well as the price of the iPhone 8 Plus 256 GB , which was close to that of the iPhone X . Patel also criticized the iPhone 8 's aging design , dating back to the iPhone 6 released in 2014 ; the most notable critique was of the thick bezels when compared to other 2017 smartphones , designed with nearly bezel-less faces to incorporate larger screens in a similar form factor .
