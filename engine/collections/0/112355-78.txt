At the Ring 's destruction , Sauron 's power evaporated and his form in Middle - earth was destroyed . His departing spirit towered above Mordor like a black cloud , but was blown away by a powerful wind from the West ( the direction of the Blessed Realm and the Valar ) . His constructions crumbled , the Nazg√ªl were consumed in a hail of fire , and his armies , suddenly left with no direction , were easily defeated .
