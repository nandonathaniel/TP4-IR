Some micropower analog circuits are designed to take advantage of subthreshold conduction . By working in the weak - inversion region , the MOSFETs in these circuits deliver the highest possible transconductance - to - current ratio , namely : g m / I D = 1 / ( n V T ) ( \ displaystyle g_ ( m ) / I_ ( \ text ( D ) ) = 1 / \ left ( nV_ ( \ text ( T ) ) \ right ) ) , almost that of a bipolar transistor .
