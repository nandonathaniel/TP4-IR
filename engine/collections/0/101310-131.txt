In accordance with Giorgi 's proposals of 1901 , the CIPM also recommended that the ampere be the base unit from which electromechanical units would be derived . The definitions for the ohm and volt that had previously been in use were discarded and these units became derived units based on the ampere . In 1946 the CIPM formally adopted a definition of the ampere based on the original EMU definition and redefined the ohm in terms of other base units . The definitions for absolute electrical system based on the ampere was formalised in 1948 . The draft proposal units with these names are very close , but not identical to the International units .
