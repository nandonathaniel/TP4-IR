Mu'awiyah introduced postal service , Abd al - Malik extended it throughout his empire , and Walid made full use of it . The Umayyad Caliph Abd al - Malik developed a regular postal service . Umar bin Abdul - Aziz developed it further by building caravanserais at stages along the Khurasan highway . Relays of horses were used for the conveyance of dispatches between the caliph and his agents and officials posted in the provinces . The main highways were divided into stages of 12 miles ( 19 km ) each and each stage had horses , donkeys or camels ready to carry the post . Primarily the service met the needs of Government officials , but travellers and their important dispatches were also benefitted by the system . The postal carriages were also used for the swift transport of troops . They were able to carry fifty to a hundred men at a time . Under Governor Yusuf bin Umar , the postal department of Iraq cost 4,000,000 dirhams a year .
