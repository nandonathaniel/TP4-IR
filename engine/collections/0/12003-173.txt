One of the questions which taxed Law 's brief government was that of inter-Allied war debts . Britain owed money to the USA , and in turn was owed four times as much money by France , Italy and the other Allied powers , although under the Lloyd George government Balfour had promised that Britain would collect no more money from other Allies than she was required to repay the USA ; the debt was hard to repay as trade ( exports were needed to earn foreign currency ) had not returned to prewar levels .
