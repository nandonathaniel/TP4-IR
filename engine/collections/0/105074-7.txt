In the medieval economy , loans were entirely a consequence of necessity ( bad harvests , fire in a workplace ) and , under those conditions , it was considered morally reproachable to charge interest . It was also considered morally dubious , since no goods were produced through the lending of money , and thus it should not be compensated , unlike other activities with direct physical output such as blacksmithing or farming . For the same reason , interest has often been looked down upon in Islamic civilization , with almost all scholars agreeing that the Qur'an explicitly forbids charging interest .
