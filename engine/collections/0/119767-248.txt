Beginning in the Middle Ages , manuals of confession emerged as a literary genre . These manuals were guidebooks on how to obtain the maximum benefits from the sacrament . There were two kinds of manuals : those addressed to the faithful , so that they could prepare a good confession , and those addressed to the priests , who had to make sure that no sins were left unmentioned and the confession was as thorough as possible . The priest had to ask questions , while being careful not to suggest sins that perhaps the faithful had not thought of and give them ideas . Manuals were written in Latin and in the vernacular .
