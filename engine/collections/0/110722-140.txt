Modal jazz is a development which began in the later 1950s which takes the mode , or musical scale , as the basis of musical structure and improvisation . Previously , a solo was meant to fit into a given chord progression , but with modal jazz , the soloist creates a melody using one ( or a small number of ) modes . The emphasis is thus shifted from harmony to melody : `` Historically , this caused a seismic shift among jazz musicians , away from thinking vertically ( the chord ) , and towards a more horizontal approach ( the scale ) , '' explained pianist Mark Levine .
