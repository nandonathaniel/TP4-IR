The former U.S. Navy facilities at Roosevelt Roads , Vieques , and Sabana Seca have been deactivated and partially turned over to the local government . Other than U.S. Coast Guard and Puerto Rico National Guard facilities , there are only two remaining military installations in Puerto Rico : the U.S. Army 's small Ft. Buchanan ( supporting local veterans and reserve units ) and the PRANG ( Puerto Rico Air National Guard ) Mu√±iz Air Base ( the C - 130 Fleet ) . In recent years , the U.S. Congress has considered their deactivations , but these have been opposed by diverse public and private entities in Puerto Rico -- such as retired military who rely on Ft. Buchanan for the services available there .
