The North American river otter is considered a species of least concern according to the IUCN Red List , as it is not currently declining at a rate sufficient for a threat category . By the early 1900s , river otter populations had declined throughout large portions of their historic range in North America . However , improvements in water quality ( through enactment of clean water regulations ) and furbearer management techniques have permitted river otters to regain portions of their range in many areas . Reintroduction projects have been particularly valuable in restoring populations in many areas of the United States . However , river otters remain rare or absent in the southwestern United States . Water quality and development inhibit recovery of populations in some areas . The species is widely distributed throughout its range . In many places , the populations have re-established themselves because of conservation initiatives . Reintroduction of river otters may present a problem in that it may contaminate the genetic structure of the native population .
