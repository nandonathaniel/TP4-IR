Continuing the use of Nazi inspiration for the Empire , J.J. Abrams , the director of Star Wars : The Force Awakens , has said that the First Order , an Imperial offshoot which serves as the main antagonist of the sequel trilogy , is inspired by another aspect of the Nazi regime . Abrams spoke of how several Nazis fled to Argentina after the war and he claims that the concept for the First Order came from conversations between the scriptwriters about what would have happened if they had started working together again .
