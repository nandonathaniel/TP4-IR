Players can collect coins by completing missions called voyages , taking loot from other ships , or raiding a skeleton fort that contains large amounts of gold . The gold can be used for purchasing everything from re-skinned weapons to new hulls and sails for the ship . These items are cosmetic and do not affect combat . The weapons are given to the player at the start of the game , and have five rounds of ammo before needing to find an ammo box to restock . The four usable weapons are a flintlock , a blunderbuss , a sniper rifle , and a cutlass . Two weapons can be carried at once .
