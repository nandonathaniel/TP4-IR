In Browning - Ferris Industries v. Kelco Disposal , 492 U.S. 257 ( 1989 ) , the Supreme Court ruled that the Excessive Fines Clause does not apply `` when the government neither has prosecuted the action nor has any right to receive a share of the damages awarded . '' While punitive damages in civil cases are not covered by the Excessive Fines Clause , such damages were held to be covered by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment , notably in State Farm v. Campbell , 538 U.S. 408 ( 2003 ) .
