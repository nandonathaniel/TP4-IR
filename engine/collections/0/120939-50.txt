Zhu Yuanzhang , founder of the Ming dynasty , drew on both past institutions and new approaches in order to create ' jiaohua ' ( meaning ' civilization ' ) as an organic Chinese governing process . This included a building of schools at all levels and an increased study of the classics as well as books on morality . Also included was the distribution of Neo-Confucian ritual manuals and a new civil service examination system for recruitment into the bureaucracy .
