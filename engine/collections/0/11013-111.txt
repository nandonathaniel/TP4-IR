The surface of last scattering corresponding to emission of the CMB occurs shortly after recombination , the epoch when neutral hydrogen becomes stable . Prior to this , the universe comprised a hot dense photon - baryon plasma sea where photons were quickly scattered from free charged particles . Peaking at around 7013117394272000000 ♠ 372 ± 14 kyr , the mean free path for a photon becomes long enough to reach the present day and the universe becomes transparent .
