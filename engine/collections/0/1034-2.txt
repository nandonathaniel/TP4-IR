Rodinia ( from the Russian родить , rodít , meaning `` to beget , to give birth '' , or родина `` , ródina , meaning `` motherland , birthplace '' ) is a Neoproterozoic supercontinent that was assembled 1.3 -- 0.9 billion years ago and broke up 750 -- 633 million years ago . Valentine & Moores 1970 were probably the first to recognise a Precambrian supercontinent , which they named ' Pangaea I ' . It was renamed ' Rodinia ' by McMenamin & McMenamin 1990 who also were the first to produce a reconstruction and propose a temporal framework for the supercontinent .
