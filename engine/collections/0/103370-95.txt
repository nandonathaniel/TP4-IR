Cagney made a rare TV appearance in the lead role of the movie Terrible Joe Moran in 1984 . This was his last role . Cagney 's health was fragile and more strokes had confined him to a wheelchair , but the producers worked his real - life mobility problem into the story . They also decided to dub his impaired speech , using the impersonator Rich Little . The film made use of fight clips from Cagney 's boxing movie Winner Take All ( 1932 ) , despite the fact that the TV movie is about an entirely different character .
