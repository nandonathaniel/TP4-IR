Slavophiles declared Tolstoy their `` bogatyr '' and pronounced War and Peace `` the Bible of the new national idea '' . Several articles on War and Peace were published in 1869 -- 70 in Zarya magazine by Nikolai Strakhov . `` War and Peace is the work of genius , equal to everything that the Russian literature has produced before '' , he pronounced in the first , smaller essay . `` It is now quite clear that from 1868 when the War and Peace was published the very essence of what we call Russian literature has become quite different , acquired the new form and meaning '' , the critic continued later . Strakhov was the first critic in Russia who declared Tolstoy 's novel to be a masterpiece of level previously unknown in Russian literature . Still , being a true Slavophile , he could not fail to see the novel as promoting the major Slavophiliac ideas of `` meek Russian character 's supremacy over the rapacious European kind '' ( using Apollon Grigoriev 's formula ) . Years later , in 1878 , discussing Strakhov 's own book The World as a Whole , Tolstoy criticized both Grigoriev 's concept ( of `` Russian meekness vs. Western bestiality '' ) and Strakhov 's interpretation of it .
