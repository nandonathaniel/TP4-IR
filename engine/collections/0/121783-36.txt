Models for atomic nucleus consisting of protons and neutrons were quickly developed by Werner Heisenberg and others . The proton -- neutron model explained the puzzle of nuclear spins . The origins of beta radiation were explained by Enrico Fermi in 1934 by the process of beta decay , in which the neutron decays to a proton by creating an electron and a ( as yet undiscovered ) neutrino . In 1935 Chadwick and his doctoral student Maurice Goldhaber , reported the first accurate measurement of the mass of the neutron .
