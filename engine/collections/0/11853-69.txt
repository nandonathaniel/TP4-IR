Broderick 's moves were choreographed by Kenny Ortega ( who later choreographed Dirty Dancing ) . Much of it had to be scrapped though as Broderick had injured his knee badly during the scenes of running through neighbors ' backyards . `` I was pretty sore '' , Broderick said . `` I got well enough to do what you see in the parade there , but I could n't do most of Kenny Ortega 's knee spins and things like that that we had worked on . When we did shoot it , we had all this choreography and I remember John would yell with a megaphone , ' Okay , do it again , but do n't do any of the choreography , ' because he wanted it to be a total mess . '' `` Danke Schoen '' was somewhat choreographed but for `` Twist and Shout '' , Broderick said , `` we were just making everything up '' . Hughes explained that much of the scene was spontaneously filmed . `` It just happened that this was an actual parade , which we put our float into -- unbeknownst to anybody , all the people on the reviewing stand . Nobody knew what it was , including the governor . ''
