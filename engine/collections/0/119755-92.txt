`` Plan Blue '' was used at St. Vincent 's Hospital in New York City to indicate arrival of a trauma patient so critically injured that even the short delay of a stop in the ER for evaluation could be fatal ; the `` Plan Blue '' was called out to alert the surgeon on call to go immediately to the ER entrance and take the patient for immediate surgery . This was illustrated in an episode of Trauma : Life in the ER , entitled `` West Side Stories '' .
