In 1762 , France finally relinquished their claim to Texas by ceding all of Louisiana west of the Mississippi River to Spain as part of the treaty to end the Seven Years ' War . Spain saw no need to continue to maintain settlements near French outposts and ordered the closure of Los Adaes , making San Antonio the new provincial capital . The residents of Los Adaes were relocated in 1773 . After several attempts to settle in other parts of the province , the residents returned to East Texas without authorization and founded Nacogdoches .
