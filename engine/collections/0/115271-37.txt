In 1747 the German chemist Andreas Marggraf identified sucrose in beet root . This discovery remained a mere curiosity for some time , but eventually Marggraf 's student Franz Achard built a sugar beet processing factory at Cunern in Silesia ( in present - day Konary in Poland ) , under the patronage of King Frederick William III of Prussia ( reigned 1797 -- 1840 ) . While never profitable , this plant operated from 1801 until it suffered destruction during the Napoleonic Wars ( ca . 1802 -- 1815 ) .
