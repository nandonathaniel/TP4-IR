Connie Ogle of the Miami Herald gave the film one out of four stars , saying , `` Nobody escapes untainted by the foul stench of Grown Ups 2 ; it 's bad enough to make you look askance at Salma Hayek , Maria Bello , and Maya Rudolph , all of whom deserve a chance to do something funny other than pose as wives exuding various degrees of sexiness . '' Richard Roeper gave the film one and a half stars , saying , `` When Taylor Lautner is the funniest thing in a movie starring Adam Sandler and Chris Rock , we 're in trouble . '' Randy Cordova of The Arizona Republic gave the film one out of five stars , saying , `` In its own way , `` Grown Ups 2 '' sets the bar really high . After all , it 's hard to imagine another comedy coming along this year that is this abrasive and free of laughs . It 's like everyone involved intentionally tried to create a horrible movie . '' Alonso Duralde of The Wrap wrote , `` Yes , it 's time for another visit to the Adam Sandler Death - of - Cinema Fun Factory , the big - screen version of a terrible sitcom where laugh tracks are replaced by the co-stars chuckling at their own awful material . '' Adam Nayman of The Globe and Mail gave the film two out four stars , saying , `` None of the stars are trying very hard , and so the most memorable presences are the cameos : If nothing else , Grown Ups 2 will go down as the only film in history to find room for Steve Buscemi alongside `` Stone Cold '' Steve Austin .
