No cancellation : Unlike multiplication of ordinary numbers , where if ab = ac , then b always equals c unless a is zero , the dot product does not obey the cancellation law : If a ⋅ b = a ⋅ c and a ≠ 0 , then we can write : a ⋅ ( b − c ) = 0 by the distributive law ; the result above says this just means that a is perpendicular to ( b − c ) , which still allows ( b − c ) ≠ 0 , and therefore b ≠ c .
