During the next few years CP Rail downsized its route , and several Canadian branch lines and even some secondary mainlines were either sold to short lines or abandoned . This rationalization , however , came at a price , as many grain elevators in the region known as Canada 's Breadbasket shut down due to not being able to distribute their thousands of bushels of grain through a large enough region . This included all of its lines east of Montreal , with the routes operating across Maine and New Brunswick to the port of Saint John ( operating as the Canadian Atlantic Railway ) being sold or abandoned , severing CPR 's transcontinental status ( in Canada ) ; the opening of the St. Lawrence Seaway in the late 1950s , coupled with subsidized icebreaking services , made Saint John surplus to CPR 's requirements .
