With the accession of Pope John Paul II after the mysterious death of Pope John Paul I ( who only survived as pope for 33 days ) , the church had , for the first time since Pope Adrian VI in the 16th century , a non-Italian pope . John Paul II has been credited with helping to bring down communism in eastern Europe by sparking what amounted to a peaceful revolution in his Polish homeland . Lech Wałęsa , one of the several founders of the Solidarity worker movement that ultimately toppled communism , credited John Paul with giving Poles the courage to rise up . The last Soviet premier Mikhail Gorbachev acknowledged publicly the role of John Paul II in the fall of Communism . The pope himself stated after the fall of Communism that `` the claim to build a world without God has been shown to be an illusion '' ( Prague , April 21 , 1990 ) .
