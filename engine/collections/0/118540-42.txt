... Yet it is impossible that this should be the true view . For teeth and all other natural things either invariably or normally come about in a given way ; but of not one of the results of chance or spontaneity is this true . We do not ascribe to chance or mere coincidence the frequency of rain in winter , but frequent rain in summer we do ; nor heat in the dog - days , but only if we have it in winter . If then , it is agreed that things are either the result of coincidence or for an end , and these can not be the result of coincidence or spontaneity , it follows that they must be for an end ; and that such things are all due to nature even the champions of the theory which is before us would agree . Therefore action for an end is present in things which come to be and are by nature .
