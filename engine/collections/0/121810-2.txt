The Emerson effect is the increase in the rate of photosynthesis after chloroplasts are exposed to light of wavelength 680 nm ( deep red spectrum ) and more than 680 nm ( far red spectrum ) . When simultaneously exposed to light of both wavelengths , the rate of photosynthesis is far higher than the sum of the red light and far red light photosynthesis rates . The effect was early evidence that two photosystems , processing different wavelengths , cooperate in photosynthesis .
