The analyses described above concluded that sponges are closest to the ancestors of all Metazoa , of all multi-celled animals including both sponges and more complex groups . However , another comparison in 2008 of 150 genes in each of 21 genera , ranging from fungi to humans but including only two species of sponge , suggested that comb jellies ( ctenophora ) are the most basal lineage of the Metazoa included in the sample . If this is correct , either modern comb jellies developed their complex structures independently of other Metazoa , or sponges ' ancestors were more complex and all known sponges are drastically simplified forms . The study recommended further analyses using a wider range of sponges and other simple Metazoa such as Placozoa . The results of such an analysis , published in 2009 , suggest that a return to the previous view may be warranted . ' Family trees ' constructed using a combination of all available data -- morphological , developmental and molecular -- concluded that the sponges are in fact a monophyletic group , and with the cnidarians form the sister group to the bilaterians .
