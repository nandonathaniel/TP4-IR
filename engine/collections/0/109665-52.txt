The role of Major Doryan was written for Marlon Brando , who initially accepted , but problems with the production of Burn ! forced him to drop out . Peter O'Toole , Richard Harris and Richard Burton also were considered . Lean then saw Christopher Jones in The Looking Glass War ( 1969 ) and decided he had to have Jones for the part , and so cast him without ever meeting him . He thought Chris had that rare Brando / Dean quality he wanted on film .
