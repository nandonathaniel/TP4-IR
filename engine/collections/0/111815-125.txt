The introduction and broad adoption of scientific agriculture since the mid-19th century contributed to economic growth in the United States . This development was facilitated by the Morrill Act and the Hatch Act of 1887 which established in each state a land - grant university ( with a mission to teach and study agriculture ) and a federally funded system of agricultural experiment stations and cooperative extension networks which place extension agents in each state . Iowa State University became the nation 's first designated land - grant institution when the Iowa Legislature accepted the provisions of the 1862 Morrill Act on September 11 , 1862 , making Iowa the first state in the nation to do so .
