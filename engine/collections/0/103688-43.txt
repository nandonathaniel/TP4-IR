Windows Explorer includes significant changes from previous versions of Windows such as improved filtering , sorting , grouping and stacking . Combined with integrated desktop search , Windows Explorer allows users to find and organize their files in new ways , such as Stacks . The new Stacks viewing mode groups files according to the criterion specified by the user . Stacks can be clicked to filter the files shown in Windows Explorer . There is also the ability to save searches as virtual folders or Search Folders . A Search Folder is simply an XML file , which stores the query in a form that can be used by the Windows search subsystem . When accessed , the search is executed and the results are aggregated and presented as a virtual folder . Windows Vista includes six Search Folders by default : Recent Documents , Recent E-mail , Recent Music , Recent Pictures and Videos , Recently Changed , and Shared By Me . When sorting items , the sort order no longer remains consistently Ascending or Descending . Each property has a preferred sort direction . For example , Sort by Date defaults to Descending order , as does Size . But Name and Type default to Ascending order .
