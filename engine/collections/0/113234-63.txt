In 1822 , Kirikiriroa Pa was briefly abandoned to escape the Musket Wars . However , by the 1830s Ngati Wairere 's principal pa was Kirikiriroa , where the missionaries , who arrived at that time , estimated 200 people lived permanently . A chapel and house were built at Kirikiriroa for visiting clergy , presumably after Benjamin Ashwell established his mission near Taupiri .
