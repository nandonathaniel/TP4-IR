Transitions : This mark is evaluating all the `` in between '' skating when not performing technical elements , i.e. whether the skater is merely skating in circles , or with different turns and steps , perhaps also using their arms . A program with good transitions `` threads '' all the elements together and will make the skater 's program seem effortless . Poor transitions are sometimes nonexistent or merely places between the technical elements with a precise `` stopping '' point where the skater begins to prepare for another technical element .
