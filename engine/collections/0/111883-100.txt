Certain Anglo - Saxon burials appeared to have ritualistic elements to them , implying that a religious rite was performed over them during the funeral . While there are many multiple burials , where more than one corpse was found in a single grave , that date from the Anglo - Saxon period , there is `` a small group of such burials where an interpretation involving ritual practices may be possible '' . For instance , at Welbeck Hill in Lincolnshire , the corpse of a decapitated woman was placed in reverse on top of the body of an old man , while in a number of other similar examples , female bodies were again placed above those of men . This has led some archaeologists to suspect a form of suttee , where the female was the spouse of the male , and was killed to accompany him upon death . Other theories hold that the females were slaves who were viewed as the property of the men , and who were again killed to accompany their master . Similarly , four Anglo - Saxon burials have been excavated where it appears that the individual was buried while still alive , which could imply that this was a part of either a religious rite or as a form of punishment . There are also many cases where corpses have been found decapitated , for instance , at a mass grave in Thetford , Norfolk , fifty beheaded individuals were discovered , their heads possibly having been taken as trophies of war . In other cases of decapitation it seems possible that it was evidence of religious ritual ( presumably human sacrifice ) or execution .
