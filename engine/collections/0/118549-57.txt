Rochester was one of America 's first boomtowns , rising to prominence as the site of many flour mills along the Genesee River , and then as a major hub of manufacturing . Several of the region 's universities ( notably the University of Rochester and Rochester Institute of Technology ) have renowned research programs . In addition , Rochester is the site of many important inventions and innovations in consumer products . The Rochester area has been the birthplace to such corporations as Kodak , Western Union , Bausch & Lomb , Gleason and Xerox that conduct extensive research and manufacturing in the fields of industrial and consumer products . Until 2010 , the Rochester metropolitan area was the second - largest regional economy in New York State , according to the U.S. Internal Revenue Service , after the New York City metropolitan area . Rochester 's GMP has since ranked just below that of Buffalo , New York , while still exceeding it in per - capita income .
