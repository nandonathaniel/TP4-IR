In the field of economics , the Health Capital model explains how individual investments in health can increase earnings by `` increasing the number of healthy days available to work and to earn income . '' In this context , health can be treated both as a consumption good , wherein individuals desire health because it improves quality of life in the present , and as an investment good because of its potential to increase attendance and workplace productivity over time . Preventive health behaviors such as healthful diet , regular exercise , access to and use of well - care , avoiding tobacco , and limiting alcohol can be viewed as health inputs that result in both a healthier workforce and substantial cost savings .
