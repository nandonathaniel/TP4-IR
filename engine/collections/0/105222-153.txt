At the end of the Exile , when the Persians agreed that the Jews could return and rebuild the Temple in Jerusalem , chapters 1 -- 4 and 29 -- 30 were added and Deuteronomy was made the introductory book to this history , so that a story about a people about to enter the Promised Land became a story about a people about to return to the land .
