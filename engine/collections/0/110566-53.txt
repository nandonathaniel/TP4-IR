During the 1960s and 1970s , a revival of the Western emerged in Italy with the `` Spaghetti Westerns '' also known as `` Italo - Westerns '' . The most famous of them is The Good , the Bad and the Ugly ( 1966 ) . Many of these films are low - budget affairs , shot in locations ( for example , the Spanish desert region of Almer√≠a ) chosen for their inexpensive crew and production costs as well as their similarity to landscapes of the Southwestern United States . Spaghetti Westerns were characterized by the presence of more action and violence than the Hollywood Westerns . Also , the protagonists usually acted out of more selfish motives ( money or revenge being the most common ) than in the classical westerns . Some Spaghetti Westerns demythologized the American Western tradition , and some films from the genre are considered revisionist Westerns .
