In 1847 in Vienna , Ignaz Semmelweis ( 1818 -- 1865 ) , dramatically reduced the death rate of new mothers ( due to childbed fever ) by requiring physicians to clean their hands before attending childbirth , yet his principles were marginalized and attacked by professional peers . At that time most people still believed that infections were caused by foul odors called miasmas .
