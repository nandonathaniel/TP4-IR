On December 11 , 2015 , Hubble captured an image of the first - ever predicted reappearance of a supernova , dubbed `` Refsdal '' , which was calculated using different mass models of a galaxy cluster whose gravity is warping the supernova 's light . The supernova was previously seen in November 2014 behind galaxy cluster MACS J1149. 5 + 2223 as part of Hubble 's Frontier Fields program . Astronomers spotted four separate images of the supernova in an arrangement known as an Einstein Cross . The light from the cluster has taken about five billion years to reach Earth , though the supernova exploded some 10 billion years ago . The detection of Refsdal 's reappearance served as a unique opportunity for astronomers to test their models of how mass , especially dark matter , is distributed within this galaxy cluster .
