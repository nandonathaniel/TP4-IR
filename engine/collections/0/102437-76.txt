The Egyptians begrudgingly accepted the Ptolemies as the successors to the pharaohs of independent Egypt , though the kingdom went through several native revolts . The Ptolemies took on the traditions of the Egyptian Pharaohs , such as marrying their siblings ( Ptolemy II was the first to adopt this custom ) , having themselves portrayed on public monuments in Egyptian style and dress , and participating in Egyptian religious life . The Ptolemaic ruler cult portrayed the Ptolemies as gods , and temples to the Ptolemies were erected throughout the kingdom . Ptolemy I even created a new god , Serapis , who was combination of two Egyptian gods : Apis and Osiris , with attributes of Greek gods . Ptolemaic administration was , like the Ancient Egyptian bureaucracy , highly centralized and focused on squeezing as much revenue out of the population as possible though tariffs , excise duties , fines , taxes and so forth . A whole class of petty officials , tax farmers , clerks and overseers made this possible . The Egyptian countryside was directly administered by this royal bureaucracy . External possessions such as Cyprus and Cyrene were run by strategoi , military commanders appointed by the crown .
