In appearance , it is possible to render YHWH ( יהוה ) as an archaic third person singular imperfect form of the verb ahyah ( אהיה ) `` to be '' meaning , therefore , `` He ( הוא ) is '' . This interpretation agrees with the meaning of the name given in Exodus 3 : 14 , where God is represented as speaking , and hence as using the first person -- AahYah `` I am '' . Other scholars regard the triconsonantal root of hawah ( הוה ) as a more likely origin for the name Yahweh . It is notably distinct from the root El , which can be used as a simple noun to refer to the creator deity in general , as in Elohim , meaning simply `` God '' ( or gods ) .
