The elementary school curriculum varies with the organisation and educational aims of individual schools and local communities . Promotion from one grade to the next is based on testing and a child whose performance is poor may be required to repeat a year , while a gifted child may be allowed to skip a year . Elementary schools provide instruction in the fundamental skills of reading , writing and maths , as well as history , geography , crafts , music , science , art , and physical education ( phys ed. or gym ) . French and ' foreign ' languages , which used to be taught only at high schools , are now introduced during the last few years of elementary school in some areas and students can enter an ' early French immersion programme ' at kindergarten or grade 1 level .
